Whilst there, I discovered a handful of kit homes in Lake Mills. Click here to see photos of those houses.
More recently, my friend Rachel sent me a picture of a very unique house sold by Gordon Van Tine . Immediately, I recognized it as a house I’d seen in Lake Mills . I asked folks in Lake Mills if they could get me a photo of the house and they gladly obliged. Scroll down to see this very interesting house!
And as Rachel Shoemaker observed, the GVT #126 was also built in Mechanicsville, Ohio (according to the testimonial in the 1913 catalog) and she also found one in Fayette, Ohio !
House Plan #126 from the 1913 Gordon Van Tine catalog.

A small snapshot at the bottom of the catalog page shows an interior shot of the living room.  Notice the heavy drapes over the entrance to the stairwell.

Here's what I *think* could be GVT #126 in Lake Mills (on Lake Street).  (Photo is copyright 2012 Dawn Stewart and may not be used or reproduced without permission.)

Another shot of the GVT #126.  Notice that the front door is not centered on the Lake Mills house and yet the catalog house has a centered door.  However, the living room spans the entire width of the house, so this would be a simple change to make.

Is this the GVT #126? I'm still not sure, but it's mighty close. That flare at the bottom of the dormer is a very unusual feature, and the house in Lake Mills is a beautiful match to the catalog image. The rest of the features are so very close that it does seem likely that the house in Lake Mills is the GVT #126.

And here's the reason I became interested in Lake Mills in the first place. The above is a picture of my great Aunt Addie (on the left) and her sister, my great grandmother (Anna Hawley Hoyt Whitmore).  Addie and Anna were the children of Julia Hawley Hoyt and her husband, Homer.  Julia and Homer's families both had deep roots in the Lake Mills area, and their children were born and raised in Jefferson County.  According to "A History of Lake Mills," Addie was shot and killed by her husband in 1901. Addie was 29 years old at the time.
