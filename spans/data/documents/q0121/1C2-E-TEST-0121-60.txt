Sears Homes in Illinois is a new book by Rosemary Thornton who has documented Sears and Wards kit-built homes in the past.  She has focused her latest work on the state of Illinois.  It is believed that more Sears kit-built homes exist in Illinois than anywhere else because of the proximity of the Sears headquarters in Chicago and the factory in Cairo, IL to the rest of the state.
Sears homes were affordably sold out of their famous catalogues and were precision kits that the owner or a contractor could easily put together.  Precision is the key word here.  The huge factory in Cairo was dedicated and responsible for creating every part used in the construction.  Each part fit perfectly well and was designed to last.  It is interesting that the factory responsible for so much quality and craftsmanship was not preserved and is, currently, an empty field.
The book not only covers the history of the enterprise, but also contains a gallery with floor plans of every Sears design over the years.  The gallery alone is worth the price of the book several times over!  It is a delight to sit on a recliner or rocker, open the book and pretend you are looking at a current catalog of homes.  As you thumb through and remember the early days of yesteryear, you can do what many did during those years, dream.
This book allows you to dream.  That's why I like it.  Keep in mind that our country grew on dreams.  Dreamers saw things in the soft haze of a spring day or in the red fire of a long winter's evening while reading a Sears catalog full of dreams.  Sears didn't just sell homes, they sold dreams and those who took hold of their dream as well as nourished and protected them are the ones who built this country, home by home, by bringing their dreams to reality.
Those of you dreamers reading this are invited to purchase this book and join us.
