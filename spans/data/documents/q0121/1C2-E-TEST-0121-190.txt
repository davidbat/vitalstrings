n 1895 the idea of a self-assembled, mail-order home was realized by       companies such as The Hodgson Company, Aladdin Homes, Montgomery Ward, and       of course the largest and most successful of these enterprises - Sears,       Roebuck and Co.  Between 1908 and 1940 the Sears Roebuck specialty       catalog offered more than 450 different models of "kit" homes,       and many variations of them with prices ranging from $146.25 for the       Golden Rod Cottage up to $5,140 for the Magnolia - the       grandest of all homes.
The average kit home had 30,000 parts, not       including nails, screws, etc.  It included everything except the lot,       foundation and energy to assemble it.  Each precut piece was       perfectly shaped, no sawing was required, and all parts were number-keyed       to a blueprint.  These ready-to-assemble homes reflected the American       taste of the period complete with modern conveniences such as indoor       plumbing and electricity.  They were shipped only by rail car to       buyers across the country.
Establishing a home's identity can be tricky.  It is unusual to find a house in its original condition.  Many have       been remodeled or the original floor plans may have been customized or       reversed.  Also, some Sears models are similar to those offered by       other mail-order companies.  On the tour, you will notice many homes       which have characteristic features similar to the Sears       models .  To       the best of our knowledge, the homes listed in this online tour have been       determined to be Sears Catalog Homes.
