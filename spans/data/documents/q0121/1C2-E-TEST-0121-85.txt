GREATEST  PART OF THE WORLD!
By A Yahoo! Contributor, 8/8/09
i came here in chicago last july 1, and ever since i always hear from my aunts the famous sears tower which i find not too exciting at first. then one boring day, just last wednesday i finally got th chance to check it out. we waited for more than an hour in the line, and after watching the very informative short film we hopped in to the elevator which runs 24ft./second. it was unbelievable! and when we reached the top it's oh so amazing and awesome! what's more unforgettable about this is the spot where you're just stepping in a glass floor. i felt scared initially.but then i enjoyed it the most and i was sitting there for about 20mins. this place is breath-taking! i so want to come back here again! :)
