Melrose Park, Illinois Sears Home?? (4/29/03)
When I was a child, I was told that the house we lived in                     was a Sears catalog home. I grew up in Melrose Park,                     Illinois.— Kellen
There are a large number of Sears catalog homes in the                     Chicago area. To find out if your house is a Sears Modern                     Home we suggest you review the suggestions for identifying a                     Modern Home provided on this site and visit the Reference                     Guide in our Reference section for additional reading. The                     best way to identify your house is to check the floor plans                     of the houses. Remember that the original owner may have                     customized your home. Many towns, cities, and counties have                     local history commission, landmark commissions,                     architectural review boards, and even town historians that                     might provide some insight into your house.
Catalog Home in Aurora, Illinois? (4/29/03)
I grew up in a Sears catalog home in Aurora, Illinois. My                     parents still live there and we would love to know more                     about the style of home they own.— Kristen              (Adam) Jachim

Sears home in Elgin, Illinois? (4/28/03)
While watching the news on WGN TV, they did a special                     feature on Sears catalog homes. I believe that one of the                     homes featured in this broadcast was my parent’s home at                     326 N. Worth in Elgin, Illinois.— Ken McDowell
The house featured in the April 28, 2003 broadcast of WGN                     news is a Sears catalog home. The current owners are                     diligently working to restore many of the unique features of                     this house.
Modern Homes workers (4/28/03)
I am interested in hearing about the people who actually                     worked in the factories that shipped the houses to their                     final destinations. My grandfather and uncle worked at the                     Sears lumberyard in Cairo, Illinois where the wood for the                     houses was cut and shipped out. My uncle is about to turn                     100 years old and he talks about when he worked at the Sears                     lumberyard before the Second World War. He has some amazing                     stories bout these Sears houses. What do you know about the                     actual people who put the houses together at the lumber                     yard, then took them apart, and then sent them out to people                     all over the nation by rail and barge?— Ammon Goode
Unfortunately the Sears Archive does not have much                     information about the people who worked at the factories and                     lumberyards where all of the parts for the catalog homes                     came from.
Maybe some of our readers know of people who would be                     willing to share some of their stories about working at the                     lumberyards, mills and factories where Sears catalog homes                     were built.
Looking for another Hawthorne (4/27/03)
I own a 1930s version of “The Hawthorne.” I cannot find                     anyone else with this model of Sears home. The catalog                     picture and description are in the book “The Houses That                     Sears Built,” but there is no floor plan. I am really                     interested in finding someone who owns another                     “Hawthorne.” I live in a community 30 miles south of                     Richmond, Virginia. There are over forty Sears homes in this                     community. Many houses are duplicate models but none are                     like mine.— Allen Melton
Please understand that we do not have all of the catalog                     home images yet available in the Modern Homes databank.                     Currently we only have a representation of the over 500                     different models Sears offered for sale.
We suggest that you talk with the owners of the other houses                     in your neighborhood to see if the homeowners have any                     information about their homes that might be useful to you.
To find out if your house is a Sears Modern Home we suggest                     you review the suggestions for identifying a Modern Home                     provided on this site and visit the Reference Guide in our                     Reference section for additional reading.

Maybe one of our readers who also own a Hawthorne would be                     willing to contact you.
The Kilbourne (4/26/03)
I would like to visit a Kilbourne No. 7013 model Sears home.                     I am interested in possibly building or buying one of these                     homes in the future. Does anyone know of one that I can                     visit? Does anyone have any blueprints I could get a copy                     of?— Teresa Cowie
Perhaps one of our readers can help Teresa out.
Sears Model 24? (4/21/03)
We just purchased a home and have yet to move into it. We                     were told that this is a Sears home. We have not found a                     picture that matches it on the web site. We found some indication that it might be a No. 24, built in 1911. Does                     anyone have a picture of the No. 24? We are going to buy the                     book with all of the pictures and floor plans, but until we                     get it we are excited to find out if this is the No. 24. We                     were told our home originally had a wrap around porch.                     Currently it has a screened in porch (which may have been an                     open porch originally) on the second floor. It has one attic                     dormer and a 3-window bow window on the front. The entrance                     to the living room is on the side of the house. We don’t                     know if the original entrance has been moved. It also has                     the built in shelving in one of the upstairs bedrooms. There                     are 4 bedrooms and one bath upstairs. I have photographs of                     the outside if anyone is interested in seeing to help me                     identify this house.— Lynn Persing

Sears Catalog Home? (4/20/03)
My house appears to be a Starlight model of the Sears Modern                     Home. The house is located in Larimer, Pennsylvania. It is                     one of three Sears catalog homes on this block. Originally                     two brothers and a sister owned these homes. The Starlight                     model that my house resembles appears in the 1927 catalog.                     When we remodeled the dining room my wife and I found a                     wiring inspection certificate under the door trim that was                     dated 1922. The floor plan appears to be a mirror image of                     the Starlight, yet there is not a listing for 1922 that                     resembles my house. Any ideas on what house it would be if                     it were not a Starlight model?—Bob Pollock
We suggest that you talk with the owners of the other                     houses in your neighborhood to see if the homeowners have                     any information about their homes that might be useful to                     you.
Sears did sell the Starlight in 1922. We do not yet have                     that image up on the image bank.

Sears Catalog Home? (4/20/03)
We recently purchased a 1929 bungalow in Ohio that we have                     been told is a Sears Modern Home. I have not been able to                     locate the model number in your image bank. Our home seems                     to resemble a version of the Vallonia (with some                     variations). I would like to verify whether or not we                     actually own a Sears Modern Home. Are there any markings of                     sorts somewhere in or on the home that is a telltale                     sign?—Dina Berger Koecher

House Plans for Sale? (4/15/03)
Is it possible to purchase some of the old Sears house                     plans?— Bridgett Peterson
The Sears Archive does not have any Sears Modern Home                     plans for sale. Perhaps one of our readers has a set of                     plans they would be willing to copy and provide Bridgett?
Sears Home? (3/4/03)
I was told my 1912/1913 home is a Sears model home, but I                     really do not see any indication of this fact. It is a                     two-story house with a large bay window that runs all the                     way up on one side and a porch in front. I have not seen any                     Sears homes with bay windows like this. The front door is                     thought to be original and has a large oval beveled glass                     cutout. I have heard from the local people that this door is                     one of the indicators that this is a Sears home. I can not                     imagine how the long running rumor that this is a Sears home                     started. I have looked for markings and found none. The                     bottoms of the floorboards in the basement are stamped Kaul                     Ind. (I am assuming this stands for Kaul Industries). If you                     have any insight on any of this I would love to hear                     it.— Angie Piper
Your house could have come from Sears. Buyers could                     submit their own architectural plans to Sears and the Modern                     Homes division would create a house from that design and                     sell the materials for the house.
Keep in mind that Sears Modern Homes were not innovative                     house designs. Sometimes people think a house is a Sears                     Modern Home when in fact it is not.
Sears sold doors, windows, and other building materials                     through a variety of Sears catalogs including a building                     supplies catalog. It is possible that the door or other                     parts of your house was originally purchased from Sears.
Sears Home? (3/24/03)
I have been told that my house is a Sears catalog home. The                     interior size is 20x22 with an 8x20 porch included under the                     hip roof. Can you identify this house?— John Sawyer
We recommend that you ask the other homeowners of the                     houses you suspect are Sears Modern Homes to see if they                     have any insight on your house. We suggest that you research                     the local county records for land purchase information and                     home sales. Many towns, cities, and counties have local                     history commissions; architectural review boards or town                     historians that might help you identify your house.
Sears Home? (3/24/03)
My house is in Newark, Ohio. I am sure it is a Sears Modern                     Home. There are several other homes in the neighborhood that                     also appears to be Sears Modern Homes. The previous owners                     said it was only 60 years hold. My research indicates that                     the house is much older, possibly built around 1910-1912. I                     believe it is the #52 in the 1908-1914 catalog.— Amy Rice

Sears Modern Homes (3/19/03)
Why can’t you sell these types of homes today? I would                     love to buy and build a Sears catalog home.— Lisa
We are glad to hear that you love the timeless beauty of                     Sears Modern Homes.
Sears Home? (3/18/03)
I am currently searching for any and all information                     regarding my American Foursquare home. Many people have told                     me that my house is a Sears catalog home. I found beams in                     the home labeled with letters and numbers such as D19. My                     home is on this summer’s Tour of Homes put on by the                     Geneva Historical Society. If I could find some information                     on the history of my home it would be wonderful.— Carol             Pitifer Noonen
To find out if your house is a Sears Modern Home we                     suggest you review the suggestions for identifying a Modern                     Home provided on this site and visit the Reference Guide in                     our Reference section for additional reading. We suggest you                     also check with your local historic preservation commission                     to see if they have any information on your house.
The best way to identify your house is to check the                     floorplans of the houses. Remember that the original owner                     may have customized your home. Beams labeled with numbers                     such as you have are good indicators that the house might be                     a Sears Modern Home. Sears used a beam number system to help                     builders put the right pieces in the right place when                     building the house.
Sears Home? (3/1/03)
I was told that I live in a Sears catalog home. However, the                     attic pull down steps has a label marked Montgomery                     Ward.— Katie Stratis
Sears was not the only company that sold catalog homes.                     Montgomery Ward, another large catalog company, also sold                     catalog homes. It is possible that your house is a                     Montgomery Ward catalog home.
Sears Home? (2/19/03)
We live in a 1911 foursquare house in Gaithersburg, MD. The                     house is less than 100 yards from the railroad tracks. If                     this is a Sears catalog home, what might the model numbers                     be?— Mary McArdle

Sears generally shipped all of                     the building supplies to the homeowners by railroad.
The Hathaway (2/11/03)
I own a Hathaway, #3082 model Sears Modern Home. We were                     able to find this home on your web-site. Our house has extra                     rooms. Fortunately we have the original blue prints for our                     house. We are getting ready to put our house up for sale and                     I am wondering if Sears homes are worth more because of a                     certain collectors value? Please let me know any information                     that may be able to help me find this out.— Michele Labadie
We are glad to know that you found your house on our                     website. Having the original blueprints for the house is an                     added bonus. We suggest you talk with your real estate agent                     about your house’s origins. Many people are proud of the                     quality construction found in Sears Modern Homes, which can                     make them attractive to buyers.
Looking for blueprints (2/4/03)
I believe that my wife and I purchased a Sears catalog home,                     The Vallonia. We are looking for blueprints or the catalog                     for this house. The house was built in 1932. Do you know                     where we could obtain these items?— Jeremy Welch
Unfortunately the Sears Corporate Archive does not have                     copies of blueprints for this house. Maybe one of our                     readers has a copy of the 1932 Vallonia blueprints they                     would be willing to share.
Because of the delicate condition of our Sears Modern Homes                     catalogs, our policy is to not copy these catalogs. We                     suggest that you check with your local public library,                     college or university library or historical society to see                     if they may have copies of Sears Modern Homes catalogs that                     you can copy. Occasionally these catalogs show up on                     Internet auction sites and you can bid on them.
Sears Home? (1/28/03)
I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am looking for any                     information relating to Sears catalog homes in Salt Lake                     City. I have not been able to find anything locally and                     wonder if Sears has any shipping records that might shed                     some light on this question.— Jeanne McJoynt
Unfortunately, after the Sears Modern Homes program was                     discontinued around 1940, the records of home purchases were                     not kept.
The best suggestion we have to that you review the                     suggestions for identifying a Modern Home provided on this                     site and visit the Reference Guide in our Reference section                     for additional reading.
Many towns, cities and counties have local history                     commissions, architectural review boards, and even town                     historians that might provide some useful information to                     you.
Original Plans? (1/28/03)
My daughter purchased a 1912 Sears catalog home. I am                     looking for original plans to the house and the description                     of the land the house is located on. The deed was lost in a                     flood many years ago. I was told that Sears required a                     certain amount of land for the foundation of this                     house.— Adele
The only requirement Sears placed on the size of the lots                     was that the lot be big enough to accommodate the home.                     Unfortunately Sears does not have original plans for any of                     the Modern Homes. When the program was discontinued in the                     late 1930s the records of home purchases were not kept.
To find out if your daughter’s house is a Sears Modern                     Home we suggest you review the suggestions for identifying a                     Modern Home provided on this site and visit the Reference                     Guide in our Reference section for additional reading. The                     best way to identify your house is to check the floorplans                     of the houses. Remember that the original owner may have                     customized your home. Many towns, cities, and counties have                     local history commissions, architectural review boards, and                     even town historians that might provide some insight into                     your house.
Sears Home? (1/21/03)
I recently purchased an older home in the Dean Park                     subdivision, which was established around 1918 in Ft.                     Meyers, Florida. The Dean Park subdivision is a registered                     historic neighborhood. I think my house was built around                     1920. This house is similar to other homes found in other                     parts of Florida. I am trying to figure out if my house is                     an Arcadia model Sears catalog home. The house was a lower                     end house and is very simple, 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, and a                     kitchen. An oak divider separates the living room and dining                     room. The house is square shaped with a porch in                     front.— James Cooper

Fixture restoration (1/20/03)
I live in a half of a twin that was built in 1926. I am                     interested in restoring some of the old fixtures and want                     the house to look as authentic as possible. I would like to                     know what was common to a twin at that time. Any thoughts or                     references I should check out?— Tanya Borman-Voit
A good source of information for finding out what                     fixtures were common at any time period is the Sears                     catalog. In Pennsylvania there are several libraries that                     have microfilm copies of the Sears catalog. In Exton, the                     Newcomen Society of North America, in Philadelphia, the Free                     Library of Philadelphia, in Pittsburgh, the Carnegie Library                     of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh, Hillman                     Library all have microfilm copies of the Sears catalog.
Trestle type table (1/4/03)
I recently came across a trestle type table that appeared to                     be custom made. The stamp by the maker says “Curtis                     1866.” When I referenced this information it took me to a                     website documenting the remodeling of a Sears Modern Home.                     Did Curtis Woodwork make furniture for these                     homes?— Christian Malosh
Unfortunately the Sears Corporate Archive collection does                     not have any information on who the manufacturer was for the                     furniture Sears sold during the first half of the twentieth                     century.
Sears House? (1/4/03)
I have been told that my house is a Sears Modern Home. I                     have no evidence for this claim. I need to sell the house                     and I would rather sell the house to someone who recognizes                     the house’s historical value. I live in Northern Virginia.                     How can I determine if I have a Sears house? Do you know of                     someone in my area that can help me out? I have looked in                     the basement and attic and cannot find any evidence to                     confirm my suspicions.— Matthew Komar
You have identified a key difficulty in verifying Sears                     Modern Homes. Not all Modern Homes were stamped with                     telltale numbers and sometime packing information and other                     markings are absent.
To find out if your house is a Sears Modern Home we suggest                     you review the suggestions for identifying a Modern Home                     provided on this site and visit the Reference Guide in our                     Reference section for additional reading.

Sears House? (1/13/03)
I have a house in New Castle, KY that neighbors tell me is a                     Sears house. One neighbor (now deceased) remembers the house                     being delivered by rail. The house was built around 1912. I                     have seen many features of the interior of this house in                     magazine articles on Sears homes. The design is much like                     the Hamilton (#102) but is much larger. Double front doors                     and the front upstairs have five windows (2-1-2). Do you                     have more information or could you direct me to where I can                     find information?— Connie Mueller
Buyers could customize practically any aspect of the                     house’s construction, which could render the original                     design almost unrecognizable. The nature of the Modern Home                     construction made it very easy for builders to modify the                     home.

Model #158 (1/9/03)
If anyone knows where we might see #158 in person, please                     let us know.— Karyn and Kevin Pellatt
Perhaps some of our readers with knowledge of where a                     Modern Home model #158 is located could respond to Karyn and                     Kevin directly or to the SearsModernHomes.com question and                     answer section.
Sears or Aladdin? (1/8/03)
I am considering purchasing a home believed to be a Sears.                     Aladdin is on several pieces of hardware, would this be a                     Sears home or an Aladdin? Could it be both? Can I find out                     when it was purchased with a name I believe to be the                     original owner?— Patsy
Since the early records of the original customers who                     purchased Modern Homes were not kept, we do not have any                     information on particular houses. We suggest that you                     research the local county records for land purchases and                     home sales.
We do not have any records that indicate that Sears and                     Aladdin cooperated in building houses. Because you have                     found Aladdin on several pieces of hardware, your house is                     probably not a Sears Modern Home.
Rail delivery photographs (1/7/03)
I am looking for photographs of the rail delivery and                     delivery to a home site for Sears Catalog Homes. Also, I                     would like photographs of a house or houses under construction. Surely someone must have taken photographs,                     either still or movie of these houses over the years.— Bob
Unfortunately the Sears Corporate Archive does not have                     any of the photographs you described. Perhaps some of our                     readers might help.
Plans for the Avalon (1/4/03)
I am interested in building a new home based on the exact                     plans for The Avalon; (3048); designed in 1921. How can I                     get those plans, with a list of the exact building                     materials?— Jeremy Garrett
Unfortunately the Sears Corporate Archive does not have                     plans and building material specifications for the Avalon.                     Perhaps one of our readers might be able to help.
Sears Home? (1/4/03)
I am in the process of purchasing a 1925 home in St.                     Petersburg, FL that I believe may be a Sears modern Home.                     The bungalow matches almost every detail of the “Osborn”                     home with the major exception of the front porch entrance,                     which is located in the front center of the porch (with a                     similar flared staircase) on the right side. Also, the                     foundation and columns of the home are brick and less                     ornate, the woodwork at the top of the columns is solid,                     there are no beams in the dining room and there are no                     bookcases separating the living and dining room. Are these                     architectural details representative of ones the original                     owner/builder may have custom ordered? Or is there another                     model that meets these specs? Are you aware of any other                     Sears Homes in the St. Petersburg area?— Ed
Buyers could customize practically any aspect of the                     house’s construction, which could render the original                     design almost unrecognizable. Keep in mind the Sears Modern                     Home architects were not innovators in home design, so their                     houses reflected the fashionable styles of the day. A Sears                     home could just as likely have been modeled after another,                     anonymous architectural style.

Sears Home? (1/3/03)
We recently moved into a 1930s colonial house that had a                     package of original blueprints in a crawlspace. Most of the                     detailed blueprints are drawn from a local architect with a                     contract for the work to be performed. Included in this                     batch of blueprints were several stamped Sears, Roebuck and                     Co. with the date 6/21/33. These blueprints also match the                     layout of the house. I also found in the package a multipage                     list of building materials titled shipment 4 and containing                     Sears, Roebuck and Co. documents that indicated fixtures and                     detail of lumber etc. I did not see our house in your                     listings but it most closely resembles the Milford. The                     blueprints reference plan #1433. Could this be a Sears home                     even if a non Sears architect modified the final                     building?— J. Murphy
It was not uncommon for Sears Modern Homes architects to                     work directly with local architects to custom design a home                     for a buyer. Your house is probably a good example of a                     local architect working with the Sears Modern Home                     architects to custom build a home based on the architects                     drawings, and borrowing from the Milford and model number                     1433. Sears then supplied all of part of the materials.
1908 Catalog (1/3/03)
Is it possible to purchase a copy of the 1908 Sears Modern                     Homes catalog?— Chuck Dupier
Because of the delicate condition of our Sears Modern                     Homes catalogs, our policy is to not copy these catalogs. We                     suggest that you check with your local public library,                     college or university library or historical society to see                     if they may have copies of Sears Modern Homes catalogs that                     you can copy. Occasionally these catalogs show up on                     Internet auction sites and you can bid on them.
Sears House? (1/2/03)
I have done extensive research trying to find our what model                     Sears home I own. I am sure that it is a Sears Modern Home                     because my next door neighbor’s brother was the original owner and he confirms this. I have photos of the home. It                     has 2 bedrooms, a bath, kitchen, and living room and an                     attic. It was built in 1935. The original siding appears to                     be wood and the attic has a cedar look to it on the                     inside.— Jennifer M. Brennan

Sears House? (12/26/02)
I am looking for information on a house we recently                     purchased. The house is a 1919 Bungalow originally built in                     Signal Hill, Long Beach, California. The house is now                     located in Bixby Knolls, California.— Thomas Crowder

Sears Home? (12/22/02)
I recently purchased a bungalow home in San Diego,                     California as a “fixer” project. From my initial                     research the home looks very similar to the “Wellington”                     5-room bungalow. I have identified this from many of the                     details shown in the catalog homes, except my home has an                     inset porch/french door entrance in the dining room and the                     home is flat across the front—the bedroom on the left                     front side does not advance past the front of the living                     room. Another difference is the breakfast nook in the                     kitchen area.— Jerry Linney
Buyers could customize practically any aspect of the                     house’s construction, which could render the original                     design almost unrecognizable.
To find out if your house is a Sears Modern Home we suggest                     you review the suggestions for identifying a Modern Home                     provided on this site and visit the Reference Guide in our                     Reference section for additional reading. The best way to                     identify your house is to check the floorplans of the                     houses. Many towns, cities, and counties have local history                     commissions, architectural review boards, and even town                     historians that might provide some insight into your house.
Architectural Replicas (8/01/02)
I live in a 1920s foursquare home that I don’t think is a                     Sears house, but much of the trim and woodwork does resemble                     items in the Sears catalogs. I am interested in finding more                     information on some of the architectural features Sears                     offered in kit form, such as colonnades, kitchen cabinets,                     and built-in sideboards, etc., as I am interested in                     building replicas of these pieces. Does anyone know where I                     can find diagrams and information.— Gary Gray
Actual blueprints and physical renderings of the                     architectural designs in prefabricated houses that you are                     searching for are rare for the pre-World War II era. There                     are two books we can recommend that may have substantial                     information on house designs and elements of the era. Look                     for The Comfortable House: North American Suburban                     Architecture, 1890–1930, by Alan Gowans; and America’s                     Favorite Homes: Mail-Order Catalogues as a Guide to Popular                     Early 20th-Century Houses, by Robert Schweitzer and Michael                     W. R. Davis.
If our readers have any ideas for books on Modern Homes                     architectural elements, please submit them, and we’ll post                     your responses.
Why No Complete Catalogs? (7/29/02)
Why don’t you have the complete catalogs from front to                     back on your site? I am considering purchasing a home in                     Historic Kenwood, in St. Petersburg, Fla., which I highly                     suspect is a Lewiston. Of course, I have no confirmation of                     this, but it had some very interesting light fixtures in the                     attic, which would be telltale signs of this. It’s been                     difficult at best getting specific information regarding                     fixtures, and it would be great if there were an online                     archive of such material.— Stu Fulford
You are absolutely correct, Stu. It would be great if there                     were a complete online archive of the Sears Modern Homes                     catalogs. The unfortunate reality is that, in order to do                     so, we would have to digitally scan and upload every single                     page to each catalog, including the specialty catalogs,                     Sears produced between 1908 and 1940. The time and financial                     resources required to do so are simply too great to                     undertake such a project at this time. We share your desire                     to post all pages to all catalogs, but we sincerely                     appreciate your—and all of our site’s                     visitors’—continued support.
Good luck confirming your potential Modern Homes                     purchase. We suggest reviewing the Reference Guide section                     of the website. These resources may not all be online, but                     they have proven to be very useful.
Mobile Modern Home? (7/09/02)
My landlord told me that my house is a Sears catalog home                     that was moved to its current location in the 1920s. I can                     neither match it to the pictures on this site nor to the                     information given on this site. Is there a way I could find                     out what year and model it is? The adjacent four houses to                     me are also the same [model] house.—Cristina Torres
We recommend you first ask the owners or residents of the                     four neighboring homes if they know anything about their                     houses being Sears Modern Homes. Usually, the homeowners are                     the best resource, as information gets passed from homeowner                     to homeowner (much as your landlord did to you). If they                     don’t know, you could consult the book Houses By Mail (see                     the Reference Guide within this Reference page). Otherwise,                     you may want to consult your local historical society to see                     if any experts on your neighborhood’s history may know how                     four houses of the same design came to reside on the same                     block.
Maybe Maytown? (7/12/02)
I own a Maytown model (No. 167) in Greene County                     (southwestern Pennsylvania). My deed says the house was                     built in 1932; however, your records show that the home was                     offered in catalogs from 1911 to 1918 and reappeared in                     1922. Why the discrepancy in years? Also, my home is                     somewhat modified, with an additional room to the left of                     the reception hall on the first floor and an enlarged hall                     and bedroom on the second floor. Was this actually another                     model that isn’t featured on your site, or was it a                     customized design?—Dennis Pozviak
There are two parts to address in your question. First,                     the gaps that appear in the dates for house models represent                     just that—gaps of time, when the model was not offered,                     then was re-offered through the catalogs for one reason or                     another. Second, it is interesting that you say your house,                     built in 1932, resembles the Maytown, because a check of the                     1931 and 1932 Modern Homes catalogs has not revealed any                     designs that are similar to the Maytown, which features a                     distinctive conical, gabled portion of the roof, over the                     right side of the house.
Houses By Rail (7/02/02)
Most references to the Sears Modern Homes mention railroad                     shipments. Do you have any specific information or knowledge                     of references materials on the shipping of the homes by                     rail, such as which railroads or rail routes were used, what                     type of cars were used to ship the homes, destinations,                     etc.?— John Fryar
There is little documentation in the Sears Archives to                     lend insight into your question. The few freight receipts we                     have do include railroad names: Texas & Pacific Railway                     Company, Santa Fe Railroad, St. Louis Southwestern Railway                     Co. of Texas, and the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co.                     That’s all we have, however.
Individual receipts of shipments would be the best, most                     accurate pieces of evidence for the railroad lines used for                     Modern Homes shipments. We can tell you, however, that by                     the 1930s, the Modern Homes department had shipped major                     lumber and millwork from plants in Mansfield, La., Newark,                     N.J., Norwood, Ohio, and Cairo, Ill. So all shipments of                     lumber would have fanned out throughout the United States                     from those three locations. As for the destinations of the                     shipments, the best evidence is again the catalogs, which                     mention in the text which cities already featured the                     advertised house models. Many of the images in our Imagebank                     feature such text.
Brazil (Indiana) Brick Bungalow (7/15/02)
I have been told by the grandson of the original owner of my                     house that it is a Sears Modern Home. However, in looking at                     the images on this site, I cannot find a similar outside                     appearance. The house is a two-bedroom bungalow with arches                     between the living room and dining room, and the kitchen                     does have the built-in cabinetry for the ironing board. The                     house was built in 1932. The outside veneer is brick and has                     6-over-1 windows. The outside brick is stamped from Brazil,                     Ind. Did Sears use this brick manufacturer? Is there any                     other way to identify the house?— Dennis Smith
We don’t have any records of the brick manufacturers                     Sears used to supply its Modern Homes. According to a 1909                     history of Clay County, Ind., however, Brazil was active in                     brick manufacturing since at least the mid-19th century.                     (See History of Clay County, Indiana, Vol. I, by William                     Travis.). We are not certain whether there was a                     manufacturer by the name of "Brazil," but it does                     seem that the bricks were at least manufactured in Brazil,                     Ind. Unfortunately, the only other way to identify your                     house would be to use a resource such as the book Houses By                     Mail (by Katherine Cole Stevenson and H. Ward Jandl) or find                     a copy of a 1932 Modern Homes catalog and search its pages.
The Write Stuff (7/18/02)
As a technical writer, I would love to see an example of the                     instruction manual for construction of a kit home. Are any                     available online?— C.B. Casper
We know of no Modern Homes construction or instruction                     manuals that are available online at this time.
1911 Modern Home? (7/25/02)
I am a remodeling contractor, and recently purchased a                     beautiful two-story house that will be moved. The home has                     been in the same family since it was built in 1911. The                     story is that the house was purchased for $950, shipped by                     rail, and built by neighbors. I was wondering if perhaps                     this could be a Sears house. It has unique diagonal doorway                     leading to the parlor area, off a wrap-around porch. The                     porch originally had a small balcony off the bedroom above                     it. Ring any bells?— Arthur Green
After checking both the 1910 and 1911 Modern Homes                     catalogs, we have been unable to find a house that                     adequately matches your description. There are numerous                     homes that featured wrap-around porches, including many with                     balconies above them; however, the diagonal doorway has us                     stumped. It is possible that the original design was altered                     by the owner for practical or personal reasons.
Pre-Modern Homes (7/23/02)
I have been told that our 1904 home in Seattle, Wash., is a                     Sears catalog home. Could this be true? If so, would it be                     possible to purchase a copy of the Modern Homes section from                     the 1903 and 1904 catalogs?— Rhian Lombard
Sears opened its Modern Homes department in 1908, which                     postdates your home by four years. However, Sears began its                     Building Materials department in 1895, which allowed                     customers to purchase the materials to build their own                     houses. Sears did not offer house designs in this period,                     1895 to 1908. Your house could properly be called a                     "Sears" house if it were built using all Sears                     materials, but it is not a Modern Home.
Alhambras in Nebraska (7/29/02)
Our home is the Alhambra model and still has many of the                     original fixtures and features. Are there any other                     Alhambras in Nebraska? How many Alhambra models were                     sold?— Ellen Lierk
We don’t know of any Alhambras in your state, but keep                     checking our updated Registry to see if any homeowners add                     one to the growing list of homes. Unfortunately, we have no                     records of how many homes were sold for any particular                     model.
The Windsor (7/30/02)
I think I have a Windsor model Sears home. Do you have any                     information about this style of house?— Craig Higgs
The Windsor was offered by Sears throughout most of the                     1920s. The two-story, five-room home was described in                     catalog pages as being "in the popular semi-bungalow                     architecture." Its front porch spanned 22 feet by 6                     feet, with a balcony emerging from the two upstairs                     bedrooms. For $1,521 (in the 1926 catalog), the Windsor came                     with red cedar shingles, cypress siding, yellow pine                     flooring, and fir wood for the porch floorboards.
Looking Up Model Numbers (7/30/02)
I have a "one-floor-plan bungalow" that has been                     listed as significant to the history of my area. I am                     curious as to the name of the house. We have the original                     bath cabinets, with a model number. Is there anywhere I can                     look those model numbers up to obtain more information?— Tabatha
It will be very difficult to trace your house on the                     basis of the bathroom cabinet model numbers. The numbers                     could indicate any number of things, but probably will not                     get you closer to identifying your house, as the same kinds                     of bathroom cabinets could easily have been built into two                     completely different styles of homes, years apart. Your best                     bet would be to search our Imagebank of Modern Homes images                     and see if your home, floor plan and room dimensions match                     any of the images provided. You may also be able to check                     out a copy of the book Houses By Mail, which features                     renderings and descriptions of most of the Modern Homes                     designs.
Funding for Modern Homes Repairs (7/05/02)
I have an old Sears home. I am trying to restore it, but                     funding the project is difficult. Do you know about any                     funding available for repairing historic Sears                     homes?— Ronald Douglas
We recommend approaching local historical groups—city,                     county, and state historical societies and preservation                     agencies. You should gather as much information as you can                     about your house and the repairs needed. For example, you                     may help your own case if you can identify the year and                     model of your house.
Banned in Richmond, Va.? (6/20/02)
I talked to a local historian here in Richmond, Va., about                     Sears homes, and was told that there weren’t any [Sears                     homes] within the city limits because the kits did not meet                     local building codes at the time. Is this possible? Were                     there cities that did not allow the building of any Sears                     homes due to codes?— Jennifer
There are no records in the archives of the Modern Homes                     division that indicate Sears’ homes did not meet local                     building codes in certain cities. If they did not meet local                     codes, it must have been a very short list of codes, judging                     from the vast number of cities from coast to coast                     represented in the catalog pages. In fact, at least one                     popular Modern Homes model was built in Richmond, Va.                     "The Hazelton," which appeared in the 1911-13,                     1916-18, and 1921-22 catalogs was advertised as having been                     built in Richmond.
If anyone has further light to shed on this topic, please                     send us a note.
The Belmont (6/15/02)
We have purchased "The Belmont" (a 1921 model),                     and we want to restore the home to original condition. We                     need to know what original colors, stains, etc. go with this                     home. Please help us figure this out!— Donna Gomillion
We’ll help you to the best of our abilities, Donna.                     Page 75 of the spring 1916 Modern Homes catalog advertised                     the Belmont model (then known as model no. C237) with the                     following description: "A good color scheme is golden                     brown for the body of the house, which is sided with                     shingles, with white trim and green for the roof."                     There is no mention of the interior stains that could have                     been used. We hope this gives you a good start on coloring                     your house’s exterior, though.
I’ve Got a House in Kalamazoo (6/14/02)
I am sure my house is a Sears house. All the trim is stamped                     with the name of Sears on the back. It is in Kalamazoo,                     Mich. I think it was built in the late 1930s. It is of                     panelized construction. Where can I find the original ad for                     it?— Wayne Howard
We suggest trying your local public libraries, or any                     nearby college or university libraries, to see if they have                     collections of the Modern Homes catalogs on hand. Try                     searching the catalogs for the mid- to late 1930s and see if                     any of the homes match closely the style of your house.
Can I Prove That My House Is a Sears House? (6/14/02)
Last year, when I bought my house I was told it was a Sears                     house. I did find a Sears shipping label on the back of a                     piece of baseboard. This two-story house has two bedrooms,                     with a bath upstairs, kitchen and parlor downstairs, and an inverted dormer that provides the two bedrooms’ front                     windows. Where can I find proof of this not only being a                     Sears house, but the type of model it was, too? I could not                     match my home with any on this Web site.— Ron Roney, Jr.
Unfortunately, without an original bill of sale, you                     probably won’t be able to obtain irrefutable evidence that                     your house is a Sears Modern Home. However, just because you                     could not find your style house on our Web site does not                     mean that it was not a Sears home, either. We have included                     only a small selection of images among the total number of                     Sears homes offered throughout the program (1908-1940). The                     shipping label is a good hint that your home may be a Sears                     Modern Home, but your best chance for evidence would be to                     locate the date on the shipping label (if it still exists)                     and then track down a couple of Modern Homes catalogs—one                     from that year, and perhaps the previous two years, as                     well—and scan the pages for your style of house. Local                     public libraries, plus college and university libraries, may                     have collections of the old catalogs either bound or on                     microfilm.
Concrete-Built Modern Homes (6/14/02)
Are you familiar with any Sears Modern Homes plans designed                     to be built out of concrete block? Some say that my house is                     a Sears home, but I have no documentation. I am guessing                     that my house was built around 1910. It has three rooms and                     a bath on one side, with a dining room, living room and kitchen on the other half, plus enclosed stairs leading to                     the attic and a vestibule in the middle. The porch goes all                     the way across the front. The back of the house is slightly                     narrower than the front. There is a dormer on the front,                     with three windows up high. There are also double window                     dormers on each side.— Ed Hayden
Several Modern Homes designs were described as being                     constructed of concrete blocks, particularly in the earlier                     years of the department. A glance at the 1911 Modern Homes                     catalog reveals five homes made of concrete blocks. None of                     the descriptions for these homes much resembles the                     description of your house, however. For example, Modern Home                     No. 52 was described as having "nine conveniently                     arranged rooms. Open stairway in the hall with closet                     underneath. Doors between stair hall and living room and                     between stair hall and bedroom. Double sliding doors between                     dining room and living room. Grade entrance opening to a                     landing with steps to the kitchen; closet in bedroom. On                     second floor are four bedrooms, four closets and                     bathroom." Remember, though, that any house could have                     been modified to the original owner’s tastes. Modern Home                     No. 52 sold for $782 and could have been built for about                     $2,200, according to the catalog.
Cover Model (6/13/02)
We believe our house graces the cover of 1929’s Modern                     Homes catalog. We would like to know the name or number of                     our model.— Bruce Erik Brauer
Unfortunately, we are missing the cover for our copy of                     the spring 1929 catalog, so we cannot give you the name or                     model number of that home. However, we do have the fall 1929                     Honor Bilt Modern Homes catalog, and that cover’s model                     was "The Mitchell." According to the house’s                     description, it was "a very good example of a new type                     bungalow that [was] fast becoming popular in this country.                     Due to the high pitched roof, casement sash, batten doors                     and shutters and general rustic appearance of the exterior,                     it is classified as an English type bungalow."
Sears Barns (5/09/2002)
I just recently discovered that Sears also made marvelous                     barn kits. I’m interested in finding original or                     reproduction plans, pictures and any information about these                     structures.— Darcia Daglow
As far as we can determine, Sears offered pre-cut barns                     and other farm buildings through special catalogs from 1911                     through 1932. From 1911 through 1917, a few barns were                     offered each year in the back pages of Sears Modern Homes                     catalogs. Beginning in 1918, Sears issued separate barn or                     farm building catalogs. The Sears Archives has a few of                     these catalogs on file for research. Copies or reproductions                     of the catalogs are not available. Unfortunately, because                     the early records of barn sales and construction were not                     kept, we cannot verify original purchases and we have no                     blueprints.
Sears—Deep in the Heart of Texas (5/06/2002)
My uncle, B. G. Lyons, ordered a Sears home in the early                     1900s and it is located in Marysville, Texas. I spent many a                     night there when I was a girl, and it still sits on top of                     the hill and is in excellent shape. My dad helped build it                     and went to the train station to help pick the house up. I                     was wondering if you had a record when this particular home                     was built. My dad is gone now, and I can’t seem to find                     anyone who knows the year it was built.— Lana J. Moody
Since the early records of the original customers who                     purchased these barns or other buildings were not kept, we                     are not able to verify any as being purchased from Sears. We                     suggest that you research the local county records for land                     purchases and home sales. Also, you could research the style                     of house using the original catalog images in the Imagebank.                     Knowing what model of house your uncle built will give you                     some estimate of the date.
No. 229 Reconstruction (5/03/2002)
I recently purchased a No. 229 (built as a two-story home)                     that was originally built in 1916. In 1984, there was a                     major fire in the house (check for rafter clearance next to                     your chimneys!) that destroyed the top floor. The                     reconstruction was very well done, but I’ve been told that                     it didn’t follow the original design. I haven’t been                     able to locate any living relatives of the original owner to                     find a picture, and I was wondering if anyone out there who has a 1-1/2 or 2-story No. 229 would send me a picture of                     it, so I know what it looked like when it was first                     built.— Theresa Peterson
If any Modernhomes.com visitors can help out Theresa, you                     can e-mail her directly at the address given above. Good                     luck!
Modern Homes in Jupiter, Florida (5/02/2002)
I own a Sears home that was built in 1926 in Jupiter,                     Florida. I am told the kit for my house arrived by the                     Florida East Coast Railroad, which had a stop just over a                     mile down the road from my house. (My house is on a street                     that was Jupiter’s main street in the 1920s, and the                     nearby train station was the source for all incoming goods                     because it was next to the town’s general store and the                     Loxahatchee River, which empties into the Jupiter Inlet and                     the Atlantic Ocean.) I’m also told that five other Sears                     homes arrived in Jupiter by kit at the same time. I’m                     unable to find the exact model of my home from the images                     shown on this Web site and am convinced that the house was                     modified to better suit the Florida climate (e.g., no                     basement). I’m eager to hear from other Florida Sears home                     owners, especially anyone from the eastern coast, or from                     anyone who could provide more information on my home.                     Thanks!— Laura Bandy
Thanks for providing a glimpse into 1920s Jupiter,                     Florida, a scene that was likely common across the country                     from 1908 to 1940 as people picked up their recently                     purchased Modern Homes. We have only provided a small                     selection of images from the Modern Homes catalogs on this                     site. You may want to see if local libraries (public and                     university) may have Sears Modern Homes catalogs on                     microfilm. Also, the book Houses by Mail (see our                     "Reference Guide" for further information) has a                     great number of Modern Homes designs and layouts.
Modern Homes in Chattanooga, Tennessee? (5/01/2002)
I would like to find a Sears Modern Home in the Chattanooga,                     Tennessee, metropolitan area. This area is noted for its                     railroad heritage, so it seems reasonable that a few Sears                     home kits would have made their way here. Also, does anyone                     think it would be possible to build one of the homes to                     conform to modern codes if the building instruction manual                     was available?— William Killeffer
The Modern Homes catalogs frequently mentioned which                     cities certain homes had already been built in, but                     Chattanooga has not appeared in our preliminary search.                     Other Tennessee cities, such as Huntland, Mount Pleasant,                     and La Follette, have been mentioned, but no city in the                     Chattanooga metropolitan area. Nevertheless, that is no                     indication whatsoever that Chattanooga did not have its                     share of Sears homes. Your mention of the strong railroad                     heritage in Chattanooga is an indication that it would have                     been easier to deliver and receive Sears homes there than in                     other cities around Tennessee.
Perhaps some of our readers with knowledge of                     Chattanooga-area Sears homes could offer what they know.
Regarding your second question, it does seem that, given                     the number of Sears homes still standing and that continue                     to be bought and sold as-is, that several of the Sears home                     design could, with licensed and trained guidance, be built                     to conform to modern codes.
Chicago World’s Fair (4/28/2002)
An old family story told of my home being in the Chicago                     World’s Fair. It claimed that it was one of two Sears                     homes on display at the Fair. After the Fair, the two houses                     were moved by rail and built in Mineral, Illinois. The dates                     do not match the Modern Home timeline, but the style does.                     The addition in Mineral where the homes are was opened in                     1894. Any information or directions?— David Hartley
Well, it depends on which Chicago World’s Fair you’re                     referring to—1893 ("Columbian Exposition") or                     1933-34 ("Century of Progress"). We assume since                     you mentioned that the Mineral addition opened in 1894 you                     are referring to the 1893 World’s Fair. That would                     pre-date the Modern Homes program by 15 years, and at that                     time Sears did not even sell the products to produce homes                     on the scale of a Modern Home. However, by 1933, of course,                     the Modern Homes program was 25 years old and was even                     winding down in the face of the Great Depression and an                     unmanageable number of homeowners defaulting on their                     payments.
In 1934, Sears erected an "Honor Bilt" Modern                     Home at the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago.                     "Honor Bilt" referred to the program’s                     highest-quality and premier line of Modern Homes. According                     to a May 13, 1934, Chicago Tribune article the home was a                     two-story, steel-framed and air-conditioned structure that                     would feature two bedroms (13 x 12 feet and 11 x 11 feet), a                     23- x 13-foot living room, 10- x 11-foot dining room, and a                     12- x 9-foot kitchen among other rooms.
We are unable to substantiate a second Modern Home,                     however. Both the Tribune article and a Modern Homes booklet                     distributed at the Fair mention only a single Sears house at                     the site of the Fair.
A Pre-Starlight "Starlight"? (4/21/2002)
According to our mortgage papers, our home was built in                     1912. I believe it to be very similar to the model of the                     Starlight model, which was available in 1913. Was there                     anything similar to the Starlight that was built in 1912,                     and if so, how can I see prints, or how can I find out any                     information? I can’t seem to locate any catalogs printed                     in 1912.— Mary Jones
We first went to Houses by Mail, which said that the                     first year that Modern Homes offered the                     "Starlight" (known originally by the simple name                     "No. 217") was 1913. After that, we searched our                     Modern Homes catalogs, and indeed couldn’t find No. 217                     appearing in the 1912 catalog. However, we found another                     home that resembled No. 217, but the original page was                     missing, and all our catalog contains now is a very poor                     reproduction. While the blurry appearance in our catalog                     seems to resemble closely No. 217, we found better evidence                     for No. 401 being the home you are looking for.
The dimensions and floor plans were exactly the same for                     each home, and even the catalog descriptions were borrowed.                     In 1913, page 12 read, "This tasty design of bungalow                     …," and page 98 of the 1912 catalog introduced the                     No. 401 as "A bungalow of tasty design." Further,                     while the description of No. 217 never mentions the previous                     model by name or number, the text does say that "over                     one hundred homes of this design [have been] built from our                     plans and our materials." No. 401 sold for $483.
We think that the No. 401 was, in fact, a predecessor of                     the No. 217.
Other Houses by Mail? (4/20/2002)
I read an article online that mentioned 10 other homes not                     included in the mail-order homes reference book Houses by                     Mail [see our "Reference Guide" for further                     information—ed.]. Were there other houses along the same                     lines as the Sears homes or were they different?
We recommend Houses by Mail as the best resource we know                     of for researching Sears Modern Homes architectural designs,                     but we cannot vouch for its statistics regarding the total                     number of Modern Home designs for the simple reason that we                     cannot be certain how many designs there actually were. We                     do not have a complete set of the Modern Homes catalogs, so                     we are unable to tally the number ourselves.
Northern Exposure?
Les Henry, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada (4/19/2002)
Were Sears houses marketed in Canada? If so, where was the                     Canadian office, and what years did it operate? Did Sears                     have mills in Canada.— Les Henry, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada
There are no records indicating that Sears ever marketed                     Modern Homes in Canada. Nevertheless, Modern Homes catalogs                     reported sales from New Hampshire to North Dakota and on up                     to Alaska. Theoretically, anyone in Canada who received a                     Modern Homes catalog and could pick up their lumber at a                     railroad station—Modern Homes’ standard method of                     delivery for shipments over 40 miles from a mill was by                     train—could have purchased homes from Sears.
Aladdin Company (4/19/2002)
I have a Marshfield A, and I was told that it was a Sears                     home. I have the original plans and blueprints, but they say                     that it is an Aladdin Company blueprint. Was Aladdin part of                     Sears Modern Homes or is my home not really a Sears                     home?— Heather Zynda
Aladdin was not part of Sears, Roebuck and Co. It was,                     however, one of several companies such as Sears existing                     before that Great Depression that sold "kit" homes                     through catalogs. For additional information about Aladdin                     homes, you can visit the Web site of Central Michigan                     University’s Clarke Historical Library, which hosts a                     special page devoted to the Aladdin Company. (The Aladdin                     Company’s records were donated to the library in the                     1950s.)
The Elsmore Interior (3/16/02)
I'm doing a paper on the Elsmore House (interior) and am                     looking for any info. Any help would be greatly appreciated.                     Thank You— Gretchen
The Elsmore was a single story, five bedroom, one bath                     bungalow-style home. It was offered through the Modern Homes                     catalogs from 1916 through 1926 in two floor plans. Is                     anyone aware of an Elsmore that Gretchen might be able to                     reference for her research?
Doors for a Martha Washington (3/16/02)
My family and I have lived in a wonderful 1921 Martha                     Washington for 15 years. Sadly, when we moved in we                     discovered that the doors between the living room and the                     dining room had been removed. In addition, decorative glass                     in the doors of two small cabinets under a living room                     window seat had also been removed. I'd like to know if                     anyone has any of these doors stored anywhere or could send                     me pictures. I'd love to restore those missing                     items.— David Bliss
Customers who purchased Sears Modern Homes were able to                     select doors, fixtures and cabinetry from a large selection                     of styles and materials. This makes it extremely difficult                     to identify cabinets and doors precisely. Nevertheless, are                     there any Modern Homes homeowners who could help (name) by                     providing photos or information?
Home Purchase Records (3/11/02)
Is it possible to discover what type of house a deceased                     relative may have purchased from sears records? The name                     would be Josef Anton Meusburger, purchased from                     1910-1930?— John Benedict
Unfortunately, after the Sears Modern Homes program was                     dismantled around 1940, the records of home purchases were                     not kept. You can, however, review our Reference Guide page                     for additional sources of information about identifying                     Modern Homes.
The Clyde (3/5/2002)
I have a Clyde, and I think it is a No. 7030 because it                     looks like the bathroom was added at a later date. The                     cabinets are the ones shown for the 9030. Is there any way                     to find out more information and to prove my home is of                     historical value? The city is extending a road easement and                     the house is in the way! We have room to move it back out of                     harm’s way, and I would like to preserve it as a                     historical site for the city.— Betty Nolting
To identify the home, we suggest you review the                     suggestions for identifying a Modern Home provided on this                     site and visit the Reference Guide in our Reference section                     for additional reading. For assistance with preservation,                     many towns, cities and counties have local history                     commissions, architectural review boards, and even town                     historians who serve as advocates for preservation of                     historical buildings
Old Is New? (4/18/01)
I would like to know if there is a catalog of fixtures,                     kitchen cabinets, trim and other things that furnished the                     houses of the "older" Sears catalog homes.                     (1910–1930). What I am seeking is a company that makes                     these things to the same specifications today as Sears did                     originally. I thought I read somewhere that a place in                     Kansas City made replica Sears furnishings. Can anyone help                     me?— Scott Hale
A quick Internet search for replica Sears furnishings                     turned up a wealth of individuals and stores that sell                     replica Modern Homes-era Sears furnishings. You may want to                     scan the Internet for the nearest dealer, and those dealers                     may tell you who manufactures their furnishings.
If any readers know of the Kansas City manufacturer Scott                     is looking for—or if you know of other manufacturers of                     Modern Home-era replica fixtures and furnishings—let him                     know.
"Avenue" Restoration (4/18/01)
I am looking to restore "The Avenue" (No. 55P33)                     frame garage and the "perfect garage doors." If                     anyone has any drawings/prints, I would be very interested                     in getting copies of them.— Bob Disch
Reasons to Register (4/12/01)
I’ve had quite a bit of luck researching my home—the                     Hamilton—on the Internet and figured maybe it could help                     to register. We have been in this home for about 3 years.                     What makes it unique is that in 1977 an addition was "added" to the home without much of a change.                     Whereas, in 1996 another change took place in the very front                     of home, and the front dormer was removed. The interior in                     the "Hamilton" part of the house is still very                     much original … and I'd like to keep it that way!— WA2LAN$$$aol.com

The House That Sears Built (4/11/01)
I live in the Riverside Modern Home model (No. 3324). I was                     so excited to see my home on this web page. I just read                     about this site in our newspaper today. We have been slowly                     remodeling our house and have noticed that everything says                     Sears, so we often joked that this is the house that Sears                     built. And so it is true! Can I get a copy of any paperwork                     you may have on this house?— Sharon
We’re glad to know that you were able to find your                     house so easily. And we wish we could provide you with                     copies of paperwork for the Riverside, but there just isn’t any available. Perhaps another reader, though, has                     the paperwork to his or her Riverside home and will contact                     you. Readers?
Oak Park, Illinois (4/11/01)
We have been told by the previous owners that our house is a                     Sears home. I have found a very close match in the                     1908–1914 section of the Imagebank. Is anyone aware of                     Sears homes in Oak Park, Illinois? We have no other hints to                     go on.— Melissa Colombo
I suppose it would be too easy to hope that your house is                     the Oak Park, which was a Modern Home model that Sears                     offered beginning in 1926. Unfortunately, 1926 is many years                     later than the period in which you’re looking.
There are many towns and neighborhoods dotting the                     Chicago area that proudly claim Sears Modern Homes as being                     among their historic houses, so it is likely that not only                     were Sears homes built in Oak Park, but that Sears homes                     still stand in your town. If any readers know of Sears homes                     still standing in Oak Park, please e-mail Melissa.
The Sherburne (4/10/01)
I would like to hear from any Sears homeowners regarding The                     Sherburne. I believe my home is the No. 187, and I think it                     was built in 1918 or so. It is located in Superior,                     Wisconsin. If anyone has any information to share about The                     Sherburne, please e-mail me.— loviestark$$$aol.com
While you’re waiting for readers to respond to your                     request, click on the thumbnail image to see The Sherburne                     (also sold as No. 187) as it appeared in the 1913 Modern                     Homes catalog. The Sherburne appeared in Sears Modern Homes                     catalogs in 1913, 1916–1918, 1921 and 1922.
Do You Have Any Plans? (3/26/01)
I am looking for plans to any Sears Modern Homes. If anyone                     has original plans, I would like to get a copy mailed to                     me—it doesn't matter what model home it is. I would be                     willing to pay for any copying or postage fees. If anyone                     has plans, please e-mail me.— Renae Brown
The Stovall (3/19/01)
In the early 1900s, my great-grandfather built a Sears                     Modern Home on his farm in Erath County, Texas. The model                     was The Stovall. I'm trying to find a photo and a floor plan                     of this model, and I would appreciate any help.— Judy Strangfeld
None of our records indicate that Sears ever sold a home                     by the model name of "Stovall." Perhaps another                     searsmodernhomes.com reader has heard of this model names.                     If you have heard of a home model by the name of                     "Stovall," please e-mail us using the form on the                     left of this page.
Looks Like a Valonia—Sort of (3/16/01)
We have a Sears home that was built in 1929, but we cannot                     identify the model or the original floor plan. It is very                     close in style to the Valonia, but the front door opens into                     the living room, and an elaborate, wide doorway with                     built-in cabinets in the living room opens into the dining                     room on the left. There are stairs going to the second level                     out of the dining room. The big difference from the Valonia                     in the outside appearance is a window on the landing of the                     stairs going up to the second level. There are three                     bedrooms and a bathroom on that level and an odd feature in                     the bathroom behind the medicine cabinet (a closet-type                     thing that is about three feet off the floor and runs behind                     the cabinet).
Does this ring a bell to anyone? I would really like to                     know what the original floor plan was for the house. Are                     there any other resources to determine the model of our                     home?— Amanda Bunning
Your best chance to identify your house would be to check                     the floor plans of other, same-era homes that are listed in                     our Imagebank. Remember that, if you are certain your house                     is a Sears Modern Home, the original owner could have                     customized a Valonia in any number of ways.
If Amanda’s house sounds familiar to any of our                     faithful readers, please write us and we’ll post your                     response. Otherwise, you can e-mail her directly.
Two-Story Starlight (3/16/01)
We've owned a piece of property on Cape Cod since 1988. We                     believe it is a Sears Modern Home. Looking through the                     Imagebank, we found that the Starlight Model 7009 floor plan                     is almost a mirror image of our house, although it is                     reversed. Our house also has a second story that appears to                     be part of the original construction. It has two bedrooms                     and a bathroom, with dormers (4 of them) facing each                     direction. Do you know if there was a two-story Starlight                     that goes by a different name?— Merrill Kruse
There is no indication of a particular house that a                     two-story version of the Starlight .                     The Modern Homes program included many homes that were                     slight variations of similar architectural designs, making                     it very difficult to pick one model that was a variation of                     another, specific model.
Nevertheless, try viewing the Winona .                     The image appears in the Imagebank for the year 1932 but was sold for most of the years from                     1916-1939. It has a similar floor plan to the Starlight ,                     and their dimensions are relatively similar for the first                     level.
Keep in mind that Sears Modern Home architects were not                     innovators in home design, so their homes reflected the                     fashionable styles of the day. A Sears home could just as                     likely have been modeled after another, anonymous                     architectural style.
Barn Blueprints/Manuals (3/05/01)
I am looking for drawings or manuals for a Sears Springfield                     Modern Barn No. 3023 or an Honor Bilt Gothic Arch Barn No.                     2061. They were both sold in the Modern Farm Building and                     Barn catalogs from 1923 to 1929.— Rob Goodrich
Unfortunately, no complete archive exists for Sears farm                     buildings, barns, or Modern Homes. However, it is possible                     that a searsmodernhomes.com visitor may still have the                     drawings and instruction manuals for their Sears barns. If                     anyone has or knows where Rob can find the manual and                     drawings for a Springfield Modern Barn No. 3023 or an Honor                     Bilt Gothic Arch Barn No. 2061, please e-mail us ,                     or you can e-mail Rob directly — Rob Goodrich .
A Call for No. 165 Photos (2/28/01)
We are building a replica of Modern Home No. 165 as a                     visitor center (to open in 2002) at Ushers Ferry Historic                     Village in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Does anyone have any                     information about this particular house? We would like to                     find someone who is living in this house and request                     exterior and interior photos from him or her. Any help would                     be greatly appreciated.— Vicki Hughes
Your choice of Modern Home should be an attractive one.                     Click on the thumbnail image to see Modern Homes Model No.                     165 as it appeared in the 1911 catalog. The catalog page                     gives a sense of No. 165’s beauty. It featured                     "plenty of room, light and ventilation … a large                     front porch with massive colonial columns and a spacious                     rear porch," according to the description.
If anyone lives in a Modern Home No. 165, please contact                     Vicki at her e-mail address above.
Sears Lumber Stamps (2/23/01)
I understand that if a home has the Sears stamp on the                     lumber it may or may not be a Modern Home. If there is no                     stamp on any of the lumber, does that mean that the house                     definitely is not a Sears Modern Home?—a reader from                     Branchburg, New Jersey
You’ve identified a key difficulty in verifying Sears                     Modern Homes. Not all Modern Homes had Sears stamps.
Sears actually encouraged builders of Modern Homes to                     save money by ordering their lumber from local lumber mills.                     Sears wanted Modern Homes to be cost-effective for buyers,                     which often meant purchasing materials locally and not from                     the few and geographically distant Sears lumber mills.
Modern Homes Reprints (2/20/01)
Am I correct in assuming there has been no re-creation or                     reprinting of the original Modern Homes catalogs?— Elaine Marshall
Only two catalogs related to the Modern Homes program                     have been reprinted. Dover Publications has reprinted the                     Sears, Roebuck Catalog of Houses, 1926 and the Sears,                     Roebuck Home Builders Catalog: The Complete Illustrated 1910                     Edition, which lists some homes and prices but generally                     features building supplies.
Looking for a No. 158 (2/14/01)
We would like to see a No. 158 in person. Can you help                     us?— Karyn & Kevin Pellatt, Madison, WI
If any readers own or know of a Sears Modern Home No. 158                     that Karyn and Kevin can visit, please e-mail them. Click on                     the link for a view of No.                     158 , which appeared in the 1911, 1912, and 1913                     catalogs.
Calling All Lakelands (2/08/01)
I have a Lakeland, which is a double-townhouse structure                     [sold from 1911-1913, 1916-1918, 1921-1922, 1928, ed.]. The                     exterior is very standard, from what I know of this model.                     However, the interior has been divided into 4 one-bedroom                     apartments. Does anyone know of any other Lakelands, and, if                     so, where are they? This house is in Alton, IL, which is                     next to Wood River, IL, and near Carlinville, IL, both of                     which have a high density of Sears Modern Homes.— Philip Bear
Can anyone help Philip locate any more Lakelands? You can                     either respond to searsmodernhomes.com or e-mail Philip                     directly.
Standard Oil/Carlinville, IL, Homes: Part II
I am the Carlinville, Illinois, Sears Modern Home historian                     whose house is featured in the BBC Documentary. (They spent                     three days filming every nook and cranny of my home.) Our                     home has also been featured in many magazines and newspaper                     articles. Right now, it is featured on the show "Dream                     Builders" airing on the Home & Garden Television                     channel.
Regarding the question about the lone house still                     standing in Standard City [see "Standard                     Oil/Carlinville, IL, Homes"], as far as I know, that                     home was moved to Route 108, just east of Carlinville. It is                     the Langston model and is currently home to a dairy-farming                     family. The house has been added onto and changed                     considerably, but through careful research I was able to                     determine that it is the last house to have been moved from                     Standard City.
I have an entire room in my home dedicated to Sears                     Modern Homes, including shelves of catalogs and related                     materials. I also have the original book How To Build Your                     Ready Cut Honor Built Home, which tells step-by-step how to                     build everything from the foundation to the chimney.
If any readers would like to get information on their                     homes or just chat about Modern Homes, please feel free to                     e-mail me. As soon as I get my 20 years of Sears data                     organized, I will be writing a book on the homes. Anything                     else I find from other readers will be helpful.— Laurie Flori
Thanks so much for your letter, Laurie. We’re certainly                     glad to hear that the remaining Standard City home is still                     standing and that you’re doing your part to preserve and                     share your knowledge of Modern Homes.
A Sears Modern Home or Just a Sears Home?
We've found a Sears Home—we think. It has the five-piece                     eave brackets that were typical of Sears homes, we've                     identified Sears homes on either side of it and we've found                     the imprint on exposed lumber inside the house, but we can't                     find the style anywhere in any book.
Is it possible the house was so customized (by the                     original owner) that it just doesn't match anything in the                     catalogs? The house is in mostly original condition—a rare                     find in Wood River [Illinois].
It's a simple 1.5 story bungalow, with the one,                     big-gabled dormer centered on the front of the roof. It                     looks like a hybrid Carlin/Vallonia/Bandon/Sheridan.— Rose Thornton
One of the charms of Modern Homes has become the bane of                     the historian’s task: Buyers could alter practically any                     aspect of the house’s construction, which could render the                     original design unrecognizable. Fixtures, siding, flooring,                     room placement, dormers and an infinite number of other                     features could be—and were—customized.
Buyers could indicate these changes right on the order                     form included in Modern Homes catalogs or visit a sales                     office and work with Sears associates to build the home of                     their dreams, according to their specifications. Remember,                     too, that buyers could submit their own architectural plans                     to Sears, and the Modern Homes division would sell the                     materials and provide the builders to build the house.
So, it is quite possible that you have identified all of                     the above: a Sears home, a Modern Homes hybrid and a home                     customized beyond identification.

Archives
Can I obtain a list of Sears homes that were shipped to                     Joliet, Illinois, the addresses where they were shipped and                     the approximate dates they were shipped? Is there an archive                     or library that may have that kind of information?— Barb Newberg
No archive of all Sears Modern Home purchases exists.                     Local historical societies are often good sources of                     information on the presence of Modern Homes.
Model 13333: The Marion
I was thrilled to find our house on this site. It has been                     modified but is Model 13333 "Marion." Our house                     has cedar shingles, and a dormer was added on the rear to                     match the front. My question is whether the original catalog                     information is available regarding fixtures, options, etc.                     If anyone knows where I can get a reprint I would appreciate                     it.— Lois Berenyi
The Marion, was an attractive five-room bungalow offered                     in the 1933-1935, 1937, and 1937 Modern Home catalogs. The                     original catalogs would have included a full listing of the                     fixtures and options available to buyers in the price lists.
You can try searching local libraries to see if they have                     Modern Home catalogs. Otherwise, The Marion, like all Modern                     Homes, was designed in a style that was typical of the era,                     so you could also look for Sears general merchandise and                     specialty catalogs from the mid-to-late-1930s to get an idea                     of the furnishing possibilities.
Can’t Identify 1918 House
We have a Sears home that was built in 1918. My                     great-grandfather ordered it, so I'm not sure if the house                     would have been in either the 1918 or the 1917 catalog. Are                     all Modern Home pictures on your web site? I cannot seem to                     find one even similar to ours.— Sheila Olsen
Our Imagebank and Home Listing contain only a sampling of images from the                     Modern Home catalogs. Throughout this year, however, we will                     be adding more images from the catalog pages, so check back                     frequently.
Chicago Sears Home?
When remodeling my home (built in 1928) I found a shipping                     label. It had no name, but the address was 925 Homan Ave.,                     Chicago. The order number is 5915 and the invoice reads                     "933138 Rail Rd CRI&P." Could it be a Sears                     Modern Home?— W. Searfoss
Unless you can find specific documentation, such as the                     blueprints or Modern Homes building plans, it will be                     difficult to positively identify your house as a Sears Modern Home. I suggest you go to our Imagebank and search                     through some of the pictures, floor plans and descriptions                     from 1928 and a few years preceding it. You may find your                     house’s design in the Imagebank right away.
You may have a clue, however, in the shipping label.                     Modern Homes building materials were shipped by train, and,                     while I am uncertain what "933138 Rail Rd" refers                     to exactly, I know that the CRI&P (Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific) was a busy Midwestern train line in 1928. Its                     stops included dozens throughout Illinois, and the Cairo,                     Illinois, plant was perhaps the largest lumber manufacturer                     for Modern Homes. A quick search of online maps shows that                     the address of 925 Homan Ave. is very near a current train                     line.
What does all this mean? It means that your house could                     be a Sears house, but you should search our Imagebank to try                     and identify the model.
Restoration on a 1927 Home
I just bought a house that I was told was a Sears Modern                     Home built in 1927. I am trying to find some plans for it so                     I can do some restoration work and add on but keep the                     original look of the Sears home. Is there somewhere I can                     look?— Linda Dungey
We’re glad to know that you want to preserve the                     original look of your Sears home. No archive of Sears Modern                     Homes blueprints or building plans exists. However, there                     are several steps you can take to facilitate the proper restoration of the house.
First, you may want to contact your state governor’s                     office to obtain a copy of the Secretary of the Interior’s                     Standards for Rehabilitation so that your renovation meets                     their standards. Second, check your local libraries and                     bookstores, which have a wealth of books on period                     restoration. And, while you are on searsmodernhomes.com, you                     can check our Imagebank to see the floor plans and detailed                     descriptions of 1927-era Modern Homes.
Last, if you are interested in decorating your home with                     period furnishings, many public and university libraries                     have Sears catalogs on microfilm. These catalogs may provide                     you with some great ideas to make your house an attractive                     and accurate window to the past. Good luck!
Standard Oil/Carlinville, IL, Houses
I am doing research on a large cluster of Sears homes in                     Wood River, Illinois. Standard Oil of Indiana bought 192                     Sears Modern Homes in 1919 for workers at the refinery; of                     those 192, 156 were erected in Carlinville. Of that number,                     3 have since burned and 1 was moved to a new location. 152                     are still standing.
However, 36 of that 192-home order were erected in nearby                     Wood River. We've found 24 of the houses, all lined up in a                     row, and we've found another 7 scattered around town, but we                     suspect those 7 were built after 1919. We can't find the                     other 12 houses Standard Oil purchased! We're using                     "houses by mail" [ed. Houses by Mail: A Guide to                     Houses From Sears, Roebuck and Co., by Katherine Cole                     Stevenson and H. Ward Jandl] as our reference guide, but I                     know there are housing styles not featured in that book.
How can we find the "missing" houses? How can                     we identify Sears Homes if we don't know what they looked                     like? Any suggestions? Please send any ideas for helping us                     solve this mystery!
P.S. Wood River's 24 homes in a row are featured in the 1925                     Sears Modern Homes catalog. Wood River, we're learning, is a                     treasure trove of Sears Homes. If only we could find them                     all!— Rose Thornton, Wood River, Illinois
You’ve certainly done your homework, Rose. In fact,                     your historic sleuthing has opened up a fascinating slice of                     not just Modern Homes, but American history, too. The                     Standard Oil homes have been the subject of countless                     newspaper and magazine articles, including one in                     Smithsonian, as well as a BBC documentary. Fortunately,                     there is an answer to your mystery.
In 1918, Standard Oil of Indiana opened two new mines,                     employing about 700 workers at Berry and Schoper mines.                     Standard Oil paid $1 million for 192 houses to be built in                     three nearby towns: Carlinville, Wood River, and—here’s                     your missing town—Schoper, according to a letter of                     appreciation from Standard Oil that was reproduced in the                     1921 Modern Homes catalog.
As Rose wrote, 156 of the houses were built in                     Carlinville, which named the new cluster of houses                     "Standard Addition." Another 24 homes were built                     in Wood River. The other 12 houses were built in Schoper,                     Illinois.
Unfortunately, whereas almost all of the Carlinville and                     Wood River Sears homes survive to this day, as of 1985, only                     1 of the Schoper houses still stood. It seems that when                     Schoper mine closed in 1925, its workers left to find other                     work. The town never recovered. Schoper was renamed                     "Standard City" in 1978, and, today, little                     remains of what was once a thriving mining community.                     According to recent Macoupin County statistics, Standard                     City’s population stands at 135.
If anyone knows whether that lone house is still standing                     in Standard City, e-mail us so we can let Rose know.
Frank W. Kushel
I would also like more information about Frank W. Kushel,                     the man responsible for the Modern Homes division                     turnaround.— Rob Mackle
Just when we were about to give up and tell you we could                     find no information on Frank W. Kushel, we found a history                     of the Sears Modern Homes program—written, signed and                     dated by Mr. Kushel himself. The letter is dated October                     1943 and was written to Mr. Louis E. Asher, cousin of former                     Sears President Julius Rosenwald and the author of Send No                     Money, an early history of Sears, Roebuck and Co.
Briefly, Frank Kushel, the man responsible for starting                     the Modern Homes program, joined Sears in February of 1904.                     Ironically, Sears was Kushel’s second choice for                     employment. He wrote in the letter to Asher that he                     originally wanted to work for Marshall Field & Co.,                     which at that time "enjoyed the reputation as the                     World’s great merchandisers [sic]." However, a                     conversation with Richard Sears was so inspirational to                     Kushel that he changed his mind and started working as a                     buyer of china.
We’ll let Kushel describe what happened in 1906:                     "Mr. Sears offered me the temporary job of disposing of                     the millwork merchandise [homebuilding materials, mostly                     wood and glass] that was being discontinued because of the                     fact that it was unprofitable. The thought kept coming to me                     that a million dollars of sales per year was being scrapped,                     because it was unprofitable, and this business could be made                     profitable if the warehousing costs could be eliminated. The                     solution was to ship this merchandise direct from the                     factory to the customer."
Richard Sears loved Kushel’s idea and the Modern Homes                     program was born. Within two years, the two men had                     consulted with an architect and actual farmers and                     homeowners as to what kind of houses they wanted, and the                     first house designs were sold in a catalogue. (See the                     History section for more program details and a Timeline).
Modern Homes Testimonial
The Sears house that is in our family was built in 1936 by                     my father and is still owned by the family. It was first                     used as a summer home. In the early ‘60's, central heat                     was added. It was rented to college students during the                     school year and was available to the family during the                     summer. Many Cornell students rented the home over the                     years.
It has had tender, loving care and is still in good                     condition. Dormers were added during the early years, along                     with a fireplace. To the best of my recollection, Dad said                     it cost $300. (I would be interested in finding whether that                     price is correct.) In the 1940s, a basement was built next                     to the house and, after completion, the house was moved over                     on top of it.
It has been the gathering spot for the family through the                     years and a part of our family treasure. This summer we will                     celebrate the house’s 62nd anniversary.
Thanks for such an eloquent remembrance of your Sears                     home. I’m sure many of you have similar stories to tell                     about your Sears homes. Please send us your Sears Modern                     Home testimonials—building the house, a favorite memory,                     move-in day, etc.—and we will post them to this site. We                     want to hear your stories, so send them in.
"The Hollywood"
I have a home in historic Riverside, California, that is                     very similar to "The Hollywood" (1916, 1917, 1918,                     1921, 1922), but mine is a few years older. Can anyone                     identify a model from 1908-1912 that is similar to "The                     Hollywood"?— Doug Buckmaster, Riverside, CA
Well, Doug, you have us stumped. The full-width                     brick-and-stucco porch of "The Hollywood" makes                     for a unique design among Sears Modern Homes. "The                     Elmwood" and "No. 225" are perhaps the                     closest matches to the gabled construction of "The                     Hollywood" that were made between 1908 and 1912. Even                     those houses do not look much like "The                     Hollywood."
Can anyone help Doug identify a Modern Homes model that                     is similar to "The Hollywood" but was built                     between 1908 and 1912? In the meantime, Doug, you can go to                     our Imagebank to look at house models from 1908-1914 to see if you can identify one of those homes as yours.
I would like to build a model of "The Hollywood"— H.             Ocala, Florida
You’ve set your sights high by choosing to build "The Hollywood." This bungalow-style home featured                     some unique design aspects, and, according to the Modern Homes catalog, was honored by architectural magazines.
We don’t have any blueprints available to help you with building your Modern Home, but you can see "The                     Hollywood" as it was featured in the Modern Homes catalog by visiting the 1915-1920 image bank.
If any ModernHomes.com visitors have any suggestions for the                     reader from Ocala, Florida, please submit them and we will post them to this site.
Modern Home No. 158
I'm looking for any information you have on Modern Home No.                     158. I would also like a set of blueprints.— Kevin, Madison, WI 
No. 158 was offered in the 1911, 1912 and 1913 Modern                     Home catalogs, at prices ranging from $1,548 to $1,845.                     Unfortunately, there are no blueprints available for Modern                     Homes.
It was indeed a modern-looking home, with its square                     design, large porch and a 24-foot x 10-foot pergola opposite                     the servant’s quarters. The standard house design featured                     8 rooms, 1.5 baths, a shed dormer and beamed ceilings in the                     living and dining rooms. According to the catalog, "The                     first story is covered with narrow bevel edge cypress                     siding, the second story with cedar shingles and has a cedar                     shingle roof."
Remember that owners could alter and reverse floor plans                     and designs in any number of ways, so a No. 158 today may                     not look exactly like what was originally advertised by                     Sears.

1900 Sears Home?
I was told that my house is a Sears kit home. It is a                     cottage that was built on the grounds of the Mizpah Country                     Club in Sheffield Lake, Ohio. My deed shows the house being                     built in 1900. Did Sears build any homes prior to                     1908?— John Bacan
That’s a good question, John. Sears did not open the                     Modern Homes department until 1908, and it did not sell home                     designs before that time. So, your cottage is not a Sears                     "kit home."
However, Sears sold building materials beginning in 1895,                     five years before the date of your house’s deed. That                     means you could have a "Sears home" in the sense                     that it was built from Sears materials.
Modern Homes Sales Offices
Was the only way to buy a Sears Modern Home by ordering out                     of the catalog?
Actually, many customers bought their homes in person                     from Modern Home Sales Offices. This was a convenient way                     for people to work closely with trained Sears                     representatives to customize their homes. Buyers could                     choose such items as the kind of wood used for flooring and                     the style of their fixtures.
The first Modern Homes Sales office opened in 1919 in                     Akron, Ohio. By 1930, Sears had 350 employees working with                     homeowners in 48 sales offices across the country.
Blueprints
Can someone find any of the old Sears Modern Homes catalogs                     and build one of those homes today?—Irene Wright
Unfortunately, the Sears, Roebuck and Co. Archives have                     no file of blueprints for the Modern Homes program. The                     catalogs do not have the blueprints printed in them, either.                     Each house’s materials were shipped to the buyer with an                     elaborate packet that included construction manuals and the blueprints.
However, you can click on the Images               of Homes link                     to see sample floor plans and dimensions for the homes.                     Thanks for your question!

If                     you own a Modern Home in the Rochester area, be sure to                     register it in the Registry .
How do I know if my house is a Sears house?
The short answer is you can’t. Not absolutely, that is. No                     registry of houses from the Modern Homes program exists.                     Documentary evidence such as a bill of sale, blueprints, an                     instruction manual, and stamped and labeled beams that                     correspond to the instruction manuals can help verify your                     house is a Sears house. The presence of Sears-stamped                     materials, however, is not enough as people often bought                     Sears’s homebuilding materials without buying the entire                     house, or they could have even constructed the house                     entirely of Sears materials beginning in 1895, before the                     Modern Homes program was implemented. The best way to                     identify a potential Sears house is to find when the house                     was built (and hopefully the name or catalog number) and                     then to search our Images of               Homes link                     by year and number or name for the appropriate house.                     Remember that a Sears house could have been modified in                     numerous ways, including a reversed floor plan.
How many different styles of homes did Sears design?
Sears advertised 447 different house designs through its                     Modern Homes program from 1908 to 1940. To see images and                     floor plans of the house designs click on the Images               of Homes link.
How can I furnish my house to resemble the era of its                     construction?
Once you know the year or the era of your house, then go to                     the Images of Homes and click on the house’s link. This will lead you to an                     image of the house and floor plan as appeared in the                     catalog. Often Sears included illustrations and photographs                     of the interior of their homes so customers could furnish                     and decorate according to the day’s fashion. If you                     don’t know the year or even the exact house, then scan                     several houses on the Images               of Homes page from the era to get a                     general idea of typical interior designs.
Are blueprints available from Sears for their designs?
Unfortunately, no file of blueprints exists for Modern                     Homes.
