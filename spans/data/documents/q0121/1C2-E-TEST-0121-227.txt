In the late            1960s, Sears Roebuck and Company, then the world's largest retailer            with $8.9 billion in sales, decided to consolidate its administrative            operations in downtown Chicago. The company determined it needed 3 million            ft2 of office space with floors of 50,000 ft2 to accommodate its 13,000            employees in their major departments.
The first            designs were for a boxy structure exclusively for Sears, but the architects            and real estate advisors pressed for a taller tower with upper floors            for tenants. The building slowly stretched to 4.5 million ft2 and 110            stories, and in July 1970, Sears trumpeted its plans for the world's            tallest building. At 1454 feet, its height surpassed the World Trade            Center by 100 feet and was, according to Sears "as tall as the            FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) will let us go." For more            than twenty years after its completion in 1974, Sears Tower remained            the tallest skyscraper, and it is still the largest.
As designed            by architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Khan of the Chicago office            of Skidmore Owings and Merrill (SOM), the structure was a "bundled            tube" system of nine squares with sides of 75 feet (for an overall            225 x 225 ft), sheathed in a curtain wall of dark tinted glass. Above            the fiftieth floor, some squares dropped away as the tower rose to create            smaller floor plates and a distinctive stepped silhouette.
The Tower is            fronted by a separate tourist entrance, the Skydeck Pavilion added in            1985 by Skidmore Owings and Merrill. The Sears attracts some 1.5 million            tourists each year, despite the loss of its title to the Petronas Towers            in Kuala Lumpur in 1997. Though no longer the tallest building in the            world, the Tower is still title to the world's highest occupiable floor            and the highest roof deck and elevator ride. On a clear day it is possible            to see four states from the top.
