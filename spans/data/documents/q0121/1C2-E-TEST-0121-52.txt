Horrible Customer Service in Electronics. Worst Customer Service...‎ - ‎ - 2009-11-17 I had the worst experience in the television department at sears in Aurora, IL Below are a few things they did wrong --First it took me 35min to find help with a TV
--The Salesman, Roy, was a jerk
--When the Salesman sold me my TV, I went to the pick up area and they told me they did not have the TV. I then walked all the way back to the TV department, where I waited another 15min to talk to Roy, who once again was very rude. I than returned the everything on my receipt; 50 Panasonic Plasma, 3 Year Warranty, HDMI Cable, and the Stand
--The next day I said I would try again, because I had a sears credit card. But like the first I had a horrible experience. This time I talked to a guy named Pat. Pat was a really nice guy, but everything Pat said contradicted what Roy said. Therefore at this point I did not trust anybody. So I just went with my gut and bought the 42in Panasonic Plasma, which like the first was "in stock" but when I went to pick it up was not in stock. So while at pickup I asked for a manager, I got the LP manager named Bob. Before I even started explaining my issue to Bob, he had this cocky headstrong attitude toward me. While I was explaining what happened Bob cut me off and pretty much said well your SOL, He was very rude and treated me like a child. I than returned everything and went to a competitor.
--I have an MBA from UW-Madison, I have worked retail management in the past and I'm currently the VP of National Distribution of a major retailer, I was appalled how Sears treated me, a loyal customer. I will never be shopping at that sears store ever again.
--In the end Sears lost a $3500 sale, which included TV, cables, warranty, and possibly installation.
--Once again I received horrific customer service at the Sears in Aurora, IL, In electronics from Roy and Pat, and from the LP manager Bob…
