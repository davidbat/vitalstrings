Chicago: western downtown area
Willis Tower, formerly (1973–2009) Sears Tower, 
skyscraper office building in Chicago , Illinois, that is one of the world’s tallest buildings. The Sears Tower opened to tenants in 1973, though construction was not actually completed until 1974. Built for Sears, Roebuck and Company, the structure reaches 110 floors and a height of 1,450 feet (442 metres), excluding broadcast antennas and their supports. (See Researcher’s Note: Height of the Willis [Sears] Tower .) The architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill was responsible for the design and construction of the tower; Bruce Graham served as architect and Fazlur Khan as structural engineer.
Welded steel frames form vertical tubes that provide the rigidity needed to limit the lateral sway from wind forces. This system minimizes the amount of structural steel required for a building of its great height. The steel was prefabricated, with nearly all welding done off the erection site and bolt connections made at the site.
The building is modular in plan, with nine 75-foot-square, column-free units. These nine square units comprise a 225-foot-square base. At the 50th floor two diagonally opposite units stop, forming the first step back. The second step back is at the 66th floor with the other two diagonal units stopping, and the last at the 90th floor with three units stopping, leaving an upper tower of 20 stories.
The exterior is sheathed in black aluminum and bronze-tinted glass. Black bands appear around the building at the 30th–31st, 48th–49th, 64th–65th, and 106th–108th floors, at which points louvers clad the areas devoted to mechanical operations of the building. In the lobby is a major work by the American sculptor Alexander Calder , an enormous motorized mural named Universe, which he called a “wallmobile.” The tower’s observation deck, the Skydeck, is located on the 103rd floor. In the early 21st century the Skydeck underwent a major renovation that included addition of The Ledge, four glass boxes that extend 4.3 feet (1.3 metres) from the building; The Ledge opened in 2009, offering unobstructed views of Chicago and the outlying area.
The Sears Tower was the world’s tallest building until 1996, when it was surpassed by the Petronas Twin Towers (1,483 feet [451.9 metres]) in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia. (See Researcher’s Note: Heights of Buildings .) In 2009 incoming tenant Willis Group Holdings, an insurance brokerage firm based in London, changed the building’s name to Willis Tower.
