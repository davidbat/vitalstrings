Sears Hometown Stores
Richard Sears first moved his mail order company from                 Minneapolis to Chicago in late March 1887. The R.W. Sears Watch                 Company occupied a building on Dearborn Street, north of                 Randolph Street. Sears returned to Chicago in 1892 by opening an                 office on West Van Buren just east of Halsted. Shortly after                 this he moved the offices into a five story building on West                 Adams Street just east of Halsted.
Sears, Roebuck and Co. outgrew that building by 1896 and the                 company moved to the Enterprise building at the corners of                 Fulton, Des Plaines and Wayman Streets. Repeated expansions and                 remodels of this building occurred over the next 6 years.
In 1904, Sears purchased land south of Garfield Park, along                 the Belt Line Railroad at the intersection of Homan Avenue and                 Arthington Street on Chicago’s West Side. Sears built a                 merchandise building comprising almost a million square feet of                 floor space and an office building comprising almost half a                 block. The complex included a printing building, and a                 powerhouse. A prominent clock tower helped define the building’s                 architecture. The ’U’ shaped Merchandise building                 incorporated railroad tracks into the design.
Over the years Sears enlarged the Merchandise Building                 numerous times. These expansions helped make the building at one                 time the second largest business structure of its kind in the                 world. The electricity supplied by the powerhouse operated the                 ventilating system, escalators, and transmission belts for                 carrying merchandise between the stock departments and the                 shipping departments. Over nine miles of pneumatic tubing                 quickly transported letters and other papers from one department                 to another.
The first store
The first Sears retail store opened in Chicago on February 2,                 1925 in the Merchandise building. This store included an optical                 shop and a soda fountain. During the summer of 1928 three more                 Chicago department stores opened, one on the north side at                 Lawrence and Winchester, a second on the south side at 79th and Kenwood, and the third at 62nd and Western. In                 1929 Sears took over the department store business of                 Becker-Ryan Company. In 1933 Sears tore down the old Becker-Ryan                 Company store in Englewood, and built the first windowless                 department store, inspired by the 1932 Chicago worlds fair.
In March of 1932, Sears opened its first downtown department                 store in Chicago on State Street. Sears located the store in an                 eight-story building, built in 1893 by Levi Z. Leiter, which for                 years housed the Stegel-Cooper department store. The original                 Chicago occupant on this piece of land was William Bross who in                 1871 mounted his house on wheels and rolled it down State Street                 to the corner of Van Buren Street. He kept his house on wheels                 for several years because of the marshy conditions of the land.                 The Leiter Building, designed by famous skyscraper architect                 William LeBaron Jenny, included walls of New England granite.
The store sat on the corner of Van Buren, State and Congress                 streets and cost over a million dollars to refurbish. A 72-foot                 long electric Sears sign greeted shoppers at the front entrance.                 A stunning black and white terrazzo covered the main floor. The                 State street store was the first Sears store in a downtown                 shopping district, the sixth store in Chicago, and the 381st store the company built.
Opening day for the State Street store took place deep in the                 Great Depression. Local newspapers reported that 15,000 shoppers                 visited the new store and several thousand people flooded the                 store’s employment office. Sears did everything it could to                 help put people to work, employing 750 Chicago workers for four                 months during the renovation and staffing the new store with                 over 1,000 people.
Illinois Governor Louis Emmerson in a message to Sears                 Chairman Lessing Rosenwald stated, "I cannot help but feel                 that this opening will mean a great deal for your organization                 as well as for your city." Rosenwald proudly proclaimed                 that, "We regard the opening of our new store on the world’s                 greatest thoroughfare as one of the high spots of our company’s                 history."
Within the store the sale of tombstones, farm tractors, and                 ready-made milking stalls caught customer’s attention. The                 sporting goods department featured a model-hunting lodge. Other                 attractions included a candy shop, soda fountain, lunch                 counters, a shoe repair shop, a pet shop, dentists,                 chiropodists, a first aid station with a trained nurse, a                 children’s playground, and a department for demonstrating                 kitchen utensils.
