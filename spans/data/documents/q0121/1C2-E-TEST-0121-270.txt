The goal of the Zone Diet is the reduction of cellular inflammation
that makes us gain weight, accelerates the development of chronic
disease, and decreases our physical performance. All products at
Zone Labs, including our world-famous OmegaRx®, Zone Polyphenols,
and Zone Bars & Shakes, have been developed to make that goal as
obtainable as possible.

What is the Zone Diet®?
Surprisingly, it is not what you think. The Zone Diet is a way of life that helps you lose fat and increases wellness by reducing cellular inflammation. It's cellular inflammation that is the underlying cause of not only weight gain and the acceleration of chronic disease, but also the reason behind decreasing physical, emotional, and mental performance.
The Zone Diet was developed by Dr. Barry Sears, one of the world's leading authorities on the hormonal effects of food and their effect on cellular inflammation.
At Zone Labs we continue to create a number of unique dietary products that make it easier to follow the Zone Diet.
If you want to retake control of your life, then reducing cellular inflammation is your necessary first step. When you are ready, we can help.
