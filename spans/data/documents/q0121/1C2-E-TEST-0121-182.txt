Below is the Tree - Census of Seaton of Fayette County ILLINOIS
William Seaton you found in the 1840 census listing being the the husband of Elender Seaton. William Seaton                            and a female named Elender. You would most likely have to check in Tennessee as Elender and the son Levi were both born there                            per 1850 census. Here is the 1930 census listing 1930 U.S. Federal CensusFayette County, Illinois South HurricaneED # 23,                            Sheet #4BHH #90-90Seaton, Tilford head 31 married at 20 (index lists "Lillard" but Tilford is on the image)Seaton, Cynthia{meyer}                            wife 29 married at 18Seaton, Imer son 10Seaton, Roselene daughter 7Seaton, Edna daughter 5Seaton, Tommie ab. father 58 married                            (ab. may mean that he was absent at the time of the census) Note: no wife listed{where is Cora V seaton } for Thomas;                            living next door in HH #89-89 (alone) is Elizabeth Prater 83 widowedmarried at 22 (most likely Thomas' mother-in-law)You can                            tell by the census that his parents were Amanda and John W. Seatonseen in the 1870 and 1880 census and his grandmother was                            Elender Seaton seen in the 1850 and 1860 census.

THIS IS A ARTICLE FROM THE UNION MONITOR, IN HILLSBORO, ILLINOIS ]OLD newspaper in fayette county that told about the story                                     of JOHN-hannah Sears.:::THE SOLDIERS OF THE 41ST REGIMENT WHO WENT INTO THE DISAFFECTED VICINITY LAST WEEK, SUCCEDED IN ARRESTING                                     THREE OF THE PARTIES IMPLICATED. THEY CALLED UPON THE CITIZENS FOR HORSES AND SADDLES, AS THEY CAME WITHOUT THESE, THEY CAME                                     TO THE HOUSE OF OLD MR. SEARS FATHER OF THE NOTORIOUS " TOM SEARS" IN FAYETTE COUNTY, AND REQUESTED THE USE OF A SADDLE, THE                                     OLD MAN REPLIED BY DISCHARGING HIS GUN, IN RETURNING THE FIRE THE OLD MAN WAS KILLED AS ALSO UNFORTUNATLY WAS HIS WIFE WHO                                     WAS AT THE HOUSE AT THE TIME. ALTHOUGH A SAD AFFAIR THE CONDUCT OT THE SOLDIERS IN THIS MATTER ACCORDING TO THE BEST ACCOUNTS                                     WAS NOT TO BE CONDEMMED, SOME EXCESSES ARE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THEM IN OTHER RESPECTS, IF SO THEY SHOULD BE                                     DEALT WITH PROMTLY.
THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF MR AND MRS SEARS IS FROM THE PEN OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL J. N. NALE ::::IN RELATION                                     TO THE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH OF MR AND MRS SEARS, I AS COMMANDER OF THE FORCE WOULD STATE, THAT AT THE REQUEST                                     OF A DEPUTY MARSHAL FROM SPRINGFIELD, IL, I ACCOMPANIED HIM WITH A DETAIL OF FIVE MEN TO AID HIM IN THE ARREST OF TOM SEARS.                                     WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE SUPPOSED TO BE HIS FATHERS WHERE WE EXPECTED TO FIND HIM [ TOM ] AND SURROUNDED IT, BUT NOT BEINING                                     RIGHT ONE MAN WENT UP TO THE BACK DOOR AND ASK FOR A SADDLE SAYING THAT HE WAS TIRED OF RIDING WITHOUT ONE. IN THE MEANTIME                                     I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR. THE OLD MAN ANSWERED NO SIR BY GOD YOU CAN'T HAVE MY SADDLE, AND JUMPING UP AND SEIZING HIS GUN                                     HE SAW ME AND FIRED BARELY MISSING ME. HE THEN SPOKE TO SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE, SAYING BAR THE DOOR AND I'LL KILL ALL THE DAMN                                     SON'S OF BITCHES . A NUMBER OF MEN WERE SUPPOSE TO BE IN THE HOUSE, AND MY MEN ALL STOOD UP CLOSE TO IT TO KEEP FROM BEING                                     SHOT AT THROUGH THE WINDOWS. THE DOOR WAS OPEN A LITTLE SPACE BY THE OLD MAN, WHO WAS READY TO SHOOT, WHEN ONE OF MY MEN FIRED                                     AT HIM. I AM OF THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SAME SHOT KILLED BOTH MR. AND MRS SEARS, SHE STOOD CLOSE BEHIND AND THEY BOTH FELL                                     TOGETHER, HAD MR SEARS BEEN LESS IMPETUOUS NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEFALLEN HIM, NO OTHER PERSONS WERE IN THE HOUSE BUT AS I APPROCHED                                     THE HOUSE I SAW A WOMAN GET OVER THE FENCE BACK OF THE HOUSE, AND GO INTO THE WOODS, I SUPPOSE TO GIVE AN ALARM TO SOMEONE,                                     SHE DID NOT RETURN WHILE WE WERE AT THE HOUSE

You must know is that -Smith R Sears and Isabell Carlock {cearlock } had many children :Anna b jan16, 1800, Miles b may29                                     1882, Mary June 1884, Harvey feb 1,1887, Lorna b april 1891.But dont know is that -they had children that died that must of                                     cause trouble in their marriage :
Sarah Sears born sept 29,1871 -Francis Sears born Aug 16,1881 -Ina Sears born Sept 10,1889.which brings to believe that                                     after lorna was born -Isabell was probarbly not want to have any more kids so she told him -{no Sex } he went else where to                                     Sarah Harris -whom he ran off with 1891.         So you see when a marriage falls                                     apart cause of Isabell children dying in infancy, she dont want to have any more children or sleep in the same bed as smith-                                     marriage dies  ?   
But what happend was Isabell stepdaughter Ada Sears got pregnant by thomas C Seaton .He didntwant to admit to it so he                                     deny it -so he can get out of it - as he felt ada Sears wasnt good enough for him for a wife -but she was good have sex with                                     told her he loved her B's and he wanted to marry her -he gave her all kinds of lies smooth talk to get in her pants in those                                     days OR maybe she was easy -she was taken in by him as he was so handsome she had a crush on him -does htt give him the right                                     to persuade trick fool her into have sex when she will pay for the deed he wont ?.But what happend was - Isabell Carlock Sears                                     did not want Ada in her house no more so Ada was put in Watertown Hosp in Rock Island Illinois left there to die and nobody                                     cared what happend to her.She was not alone at watertown in rock island many Stokes -{3 of them} were working at the faculity                                     .{her cousins are working Watertown Hosp - Stokes -they married into Harris -Hicks -Sears etc family }n census -of Watertown                                     hospital you will see Ada Sears and Employees 3 of them Stokes {1920}
If you look at Census of 1900 for Hurricane Township, Fayette County, Illinois in which MANCEL SEARS was a boarder in the                                     . .Elesan Hicks.household of john Meyer Here is the deal on that. Elesan Hicks is actually ELLISON MCDONALD HICKS. Ellison                                     Hicks was the brother of ADA SEARS' mother MELISSA ANGELINE HICKS. Ellison McDonald Hicks was married to MARTHA "PATTY" SEARS,                                     a sister of SMITH RILEY SEARS. As so often happened back then, we have a brother and sister from one family marrying a brother                                     and sister from a neighboring family.Anyway MARTHA "PATTY" SEARS, the wife of ELLISON MCDONALD HICKS had died in May of 1898                                     leaving her husband with their three children.The MARY E. SEARS who was a "servant" in the household was a daughter of JOHN                                     SEARS, JR. and a COUSIN of SMITH RILEY SEARS AND MARTHA "PATTY" SEARS. Ellison McDonald Hicks never did remarry after his                                     wife died and Mary E. Sears stayed on with the family for several years. You might have noticed in this Census that the household                                     of JOHN LAWRENCE MEYER was next door to the ELLISON HICKS household. Mary E. Sears eventually was married to JOHN EWIN MEYER,                                     son of JOHN LAWRENCE MEYER.MANCEL SEARS is also in the household. Hey, ADA SEARS didn't have a lot of options. Her Real mother                                     was dead, her dad Smith Sears had now married ISABELL CARLOCK and had 8 kids by her before leaving her Lorna {b.1891} Sears                                     was less than 1yr old ,Isabell at home with all those kids so you can't figure that ISABELL wouldnt be real happy about ADA                                     and MANCEL living with her either. After all ADA was a daughter by SMITH RILEY SEARS' first marriage and now ADA had a child                                     out of wedlock. ISABELL has to be mad as Hell at both SMITH and ADA. Am I right?
As we all know , smith sears left isabell Cearlock with bunch of children -when Lorna was less than 1 yr old {before april                                     1892} ran off with his first cousin , Sarah {sally}Harris Davis to Oklahoma , we all know that Harvey Henry Sears -Smith sears                                     son lives there in Oklahoma , get married to Emma in the census you can read all that ,see it all for yourself.
So Smith Sears left in 1891 or so -he ran off with sarah Harris -so he was not living with Isabell carlock Sears when she                                     got pregnant and had Erma born August 21,1901 who was the father? Isabella daughter Lorna got married to Samuel Horn moved                                     to michigan so did Isabell & Erma Sears {not Sears } they live up in Michigan .

many people in fayette county kept the secret of ada sears disappearance and what happend to her and even lied to Mancel                                     Sears of his parentage .John Lawrence Meyer lived next door,his daughter /grand daughter Cynthia married Tilford Seaton the                                     son of thomas Seaton . Nobody Of the Meyers would ever tell me the secref of her life - as i got intouch with them in early                                     1980.Myfather told me to call down in fayette co to talk to sears -Hicks - Stokes -i got talking to a Sears who was married                                     to a Meyer she said her son was busy couldnt talk to me as he was doing the sears family tree &meyer tree as his mother                                     is a Sears .Now .You tell me why they wouldnt tell me what happend to Ada & the secret of story but instead deny it cover                                     it up hide the facts wouldnt never tell me anything at all ?Was it a cospiracy ?Hide the facts ? Who were they all hiding                                     -covering up for anyway -was it some kind of Revenge? Who were they punishing Ada sears ? Heck - john Sears b 1895 his sister                                     Candace had a child out of wed lock Lurana Sears who married Harris -so why dont they stone her -or put her away?These people                                     were deeply religious -they were very strict ,they were very oppinionated Judgemental -so you can see with the way they were                                     they did what they did to her as well as Isabell husband Smith Sears left her soon after lorna Sears born 1891 ran off with                                     cousin Sarah Harris -whom must be who he was secretly in love with or his wife stop do wifey duties? Isabell did a wrong herself                                     -she got pregnant 10 years later got pregnant out of wedlock had Emma b 1901 what does that say -about her -she was mad at                                     Smith & she was mad at Ada Sears -she did the very thing they both did she had fornicated sex unknown person got pg!Does                                     two rights make a wrong- Does that make you HOLIER than THOU -Better than another? Did she have a right to do what she did                                     to ada and the people did to ada Sears ?
