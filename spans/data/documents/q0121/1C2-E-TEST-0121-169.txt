Building Aurora: Sears Houses in Aurora, Illinois
History
From 1908 to 1940, Sears Roebuck and Company ordered, manufactured and sold homes to hundreds of thousands of Americans. They offered quality homes at a reasonable price.
At first, the mail order business was slow and        it was not certain if selling homes would be        profitable. Sears began to see a profit with the        printing of their first publication, Book of Modern        Homes and Building Plans. Soon, Sears set up sales        offices where buyers could browse and purchase        plans. Sears homes followed architectural styles        rather than set precedent. They took already        popular designs and made them widely available        to the public in different sizes and shapes. Buyers        chose plans depending on their own style and        affordability and also had the opportunity to        modify the plan or bring in their own. Everything        from fixtures to furniture was also available to        buyers to complete the Sears look.
An efficient delivery and construction system was set up to allow easy        assembly. Materials were usually shipped by rail and shipments        were staggered according to building schedule. Because rail was the most        popular form of transportation, Sears homes can mostly be found in the        Northeast and Midwest, where rail lines were more frequent.
Sales were strong in the early Depression years but lagged by 1933. In        1934, Sears closed the Modern Home Department. It briefly reappeared        from 1935-1939 and only offered fabricated houses by General        Houses Inc, of Chicago. This association ended in 1939 and the last book        was published in 1940.
Sears homes were popular in the railroad community of Aurora, which boasts        136 authenticated properties, making Aurora one of the largest        concentrations of Sears homes in the country. A Sears Honor Built        Home office was located on River Street from 1929 to 1934 and was managed        by F.C. Gallagher, who lived in a Sears house at 125 S. Western. A majority        of Sears home owners in Aurora obtained financing through Sears        and signed trust agreements with Sears employees Walker O. Lewis, and        E. Harrison Powell.
