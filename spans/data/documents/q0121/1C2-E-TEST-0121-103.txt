(Crain's) — Sears Holdings Corp. is mulling moving its longtime Hoffman Estates corporate headquarters out of state, according to a report.
The company reportedly has been in discussions with North Carolina, Texas, Tennessee and New Jersey, according to the Daily Herald.
"We do owe it to our associates and shareholders to consider options and alternatives and intend to be very throughtful and thorough in our deliberations," a Sears spokesman told the Daily Herald. "It is still very early in the process."
Sears has both state and local incentives set to expire in 2012, and the company has commissioned a study to measure the impact a move would have on the about 6,000 of its employees and 9,000 ancillary jobs throughout the suburbs, the Daily Herald says.
A bill that's been introduced in Springfield would keep property tax breaks coming for Sears in an effort to keep the company in Hoffman Estates another 15 years, the Daily Herald reported.
The news comes just days after the disclosure by Crain's that another major corporate presence in northwest suburban Hoffman Estates, AT&T Inc., has put its 1.5-million-square-foot campus — another move that could cost the region more than a thousand jobs.
Sears moved to Hoffman Estates in 1992, leaving the Sears Tower, the downtown skyscraper now called the Willis Tower, according to the company's website.
