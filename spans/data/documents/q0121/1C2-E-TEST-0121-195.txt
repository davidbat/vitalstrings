Review by Linda C. in Rolling Meadows, IL
Project: Clean Carpets or Rugs in a Home
Did a wonderful job getting out some very tough stains.  He was supposed to be there between 1 and 3.  He called at 3 and said he was running late.  Showed up about an hour and 15 minutes later which inconvenienced us, however, in retrospect he was worth the wait.
