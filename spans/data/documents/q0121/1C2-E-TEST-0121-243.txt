If you're looking for a cheap place to stay in Chicago and don't mind the college aged crowd, try out the Hostelling International Chicago i ... moren the South Loop area. Incredibly cheap cost makes it a welcome destination for those low on cash, and you're likely to find an interesting international group of people staying there at all times. It's also right in the middle of some of the best attractions in the city including the Art Institute Museum and Soldier Field.

I just recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Schaumburg hotel in suburban Chicago and it was a great all around experience. Very cheap prices ... more, especially for a quality hotel like the Hyatt.

I suggest you try the Best Western Grant Park which has good rooms and decent service for affordable prices. The hotel is conveniently locat ... moreed on the Magnificent Mile and even has an outdoor pool.

The Red Roof Inn on E. Ontario is a cheap hotel in the downtown Chicago, IL area. The rooms are small, but if you are going to spend a lot o ... moref time away from the hotel, you can probably make it work.
