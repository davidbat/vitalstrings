According to a Sears representative, consumers are to direct all concerns and complaints regarding Sears credit cards to Citi Card Services in New York, by forwarding them to the New York BBB. Sears cannot investigate issues dealing with the Sears credit card, as it no longer has access to credit card account information.
All Sears complaints are handled at the Hoffman Estates location, regardless of what store the consumer visited.
