well, at that sears we have been quite busy the past few months with everyone needing service on lawn mowers, vacuums, and all the other equipment that the sears stores sell as well as having to find parts for peoples appliances. we are understaffed and can only do so much with two or three people on the sales floor with a line of people going out the door and the phones constantly ringing. If you want help your best chance is to just come in and hold tight for one of us to help and eventually we will get to you, you just have to be a wee bit patient.
