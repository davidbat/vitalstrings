Slacker attitude downtown. While I love having access to a place to shop for washers and dryers and tools downtown, Sears needs to big-time step up their game to get me as a regular customer. I have TWICE tried to buy appliances here, first a washer/dryer set (ended up going to Best Buy) and second a dishwasher (ended up going to Abt), BOTH times they couldn't deliver to me.  I live in a vintage walkup downtown, and they just didn't want to deliver it there.  I told them that with the washer/dryer and all of a sudden it became a big issue to get it delivered.  With the dishwasher, I forgot about that problem and told them about where I lived and that I didn't have an elevator and they took the order, but the delivery guy showed up and wouldn't take it up to my unit!
This is downtown Chicago - sure there are a lot of high-rises with elevators, but there are also a lot of older buildings without.  If Abt, a suburban super-store, can deliver to my vintage unit, why can't Sears, which is older than elevators and started in the City?
Really frustrating.  That said, Sears does have a good price-match policy, so for things that don't need to be delivered it's a convenient place to get things as cheap as locally possible for those of us who live downtown.â€¦
