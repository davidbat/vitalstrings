People have already begun to peel off letters from the "Willis Tower" signage in front of the building to express their ongoing objection to the new name (as of August 15, 2009).
As the first photo reveals, this sign is nothing more than a large metal plate fastened to the front of the original granite marker. Moreover, the lettering is likely just a vinyl decal with an adhesive backing. Is shoddy craftsmanship suggestive of their commitment to Chicago?
I certainly would never condone vandalism of private property, but this is visual evidence of the Chicago public's distaste for Willis Group Holdings  not to mention the notably cheap materials used in the making of their signs.

Latest Update:  The sign has now been repaired  and what an ingenious solution it is. They literally tacked a second metal plate over the defaced metal plate! This must be how Willis does business too?
It is official. On the morning of Thursday, July 16, the unveiling of the new "Willis Tower" signage took place within and around 233 South Wacker Drive in Chicago. However, this is far from the end of Sears Tower. The name (depicted above) will remain strong in the public consciousness.
On Thursday, July 16, I personally assumed ownership of the common law rights in the recently defunct SEARS TOWER trademark.
The original building designation has been abandoned pursuant to public notice  including a ceremonial proclamation  by Willis Group Holdings Ltd and American Landmark Properties Ltd. Furthermore, Sears Holdings itself is no longer actively maintaining its USPTO registration in national or international commerce.
The SEARS TOWER mark is of significant historic interest to the American public. It remains an asset to both the City of Chicago as well as the State of Illinois. Therefore, as a brand identity, SEARS TOWER deserves ongoing protection and recognition, and is hereby claimed accordingly.
Thus, my goal is simple: Promote continued awareness of this symbolic "pop-culture" name in conjunction with the iconic building historically located at 233 South Wacker Dr.

Sears Tower stands tall, over 1,700 feet aloft, overlooking the west side of Chicago's downtown Loop. Clad in bronze-tinted glass and stainless aluminum, rising with determination yet elegance from the depths of its grand foundations to the tips of its massive spires, luring tourists in daze, housing a workforce of thousands, the Big Store represents an era in Chicago of optimism and opportunity that will not be forgotten.
Currently, Sears Tower is the second tallest building in the world. At 1,729 feet, it is superceded only by the United Arab Emirates' Burj Khalifa in structural height. Since its completion in 1974, it still remains the tallest skyscraper in the U.S.
SearsTower.org officially launched in July of 1998, making it the longest running enthusiast site for any skyscraper worldwide.

Originally designed in the late 60's by Bruce Graham of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill for Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and Co, Sears Tower was officially topped out on May 3, 1973.
During the skyscraper's initial construction, which began in August of 1970, two other prominent office tower projects vied for the "world's tallest" title: the Standard Oil of Indiana Building (now the Aon Center) located in downtown Chicago and the World Trade Center high-rise complex formerly located in Manhattan. Both were surpassed within their first year of completion by Sears Tower.
In 1984, SOM was commissioned to overhaul many of the tower's lower-levels, including the addition of a vaulted atrium alongside Wacker Drive. Following Sears' departure, the building underwent a comprehensive renovation by DeStefano + Assoc of all public and Skydeck lobbies and elevators. This also included the construction of two glass-and-steel canopies over the Franklin Street and Jackson Street entrances. By the fall of 1995, a seasonal rooftop illumination program was also initiated. Much like the Empire State Building, the colors typically coincide with national events and holidays.
Sears Tower was the last supertall building constructed during the International architecture period, and SOM's interpretation of the style is remarkably bold and awe-inspiring.
The superstructure consists of nine interlocking tubes that terminate at different heights, creating the iconic stepped-back appearance of the tower. Each tube is a rigid steel frame that performs in tandem with its neighbor to efficiently counteract all lateral and gravity loads. This is in contrast to the popular tube-in-tube system, in which a rigid network of floor diaphrams and closely-spaced exterior columns work in unison to resist lateral loads whereas a centralized core functions to carry vertical loads exclusively (e.g. as implemented in the World Trade Center towers.)
This "bundled-tube" configuration was a revolutionary engineering concept at the time, pioneered by SOM's very own Fazlur R. Khan . It allowed for large open office spaces on the lower levels, where Sears, Roebuck and Company would reside, and smaller floor plates on the upper levels with unobstructed views of the cityscape. To aid in occupant comfort, belt trusses were rigged on the upper mechanical floors thereby further reducing shear forces (i.e. wind-induced sway).
Building automation was a primary design consideration as well. For fire, security, and HVAC monitoring and control, engineers opted for a Honeywell computer system, one of the largest such networks ever installed at the time. Another technological innovation was the robotic window washers that could be programmed to descend along tracks built into the curtain wall. Currently, they operate eight times per year.
Sears Tower also provides facilities for broadcasting to the Chicago metropolitan area. Twin 85-foot cylindrical supports, both 12-feet in diameter, project from inside the roof to provide a rigid steel base for 159-foot communication towers, which are comprised of triangular supports and antenna pylons, all of which is encased in white fiberglass radome, extending the full building height. The 101st floor is leased to broadcasters for housing of transmitter equipment.
Vertical transporation was also crucial. Designers had to ensure efficient flow of pedestrian traffic throughout the building  which, on any given day, could number in the tens of thousands. Westinghouse Electric Corp. employed "skylobbies" for this purpose, a system which Otis Elevator Co. had originally implemented in Chicago's own John Hancock Center. Designated transfer-floors would be served by banks of double-deck express elevators. Separate banks of local-service elevators would carry passengers to their final destination.
Due to its excessive height, Sears Tower was designed to lean approximately six inches from normal to counteract for the rotation of the Earth -- a fact that engineers later discovered was unnecessary. Other resources erroneously claim that this lean is the result of unequal loads bearing on its foundations.

Sears eventually chose to move its headquarters to a more human-scale suburban setting in Hoffman Estates leaving the tower nearly half vacant. Management and leasing of the property was initially given to Chicago developer John Buck Co.  who established the iconic building as a destination for many new tenants over the course of almost five years.
The building was first acquired in 1989 by Boston's AEW Capital Management for the sum of $800 million. However, despite successfully bringing occupancy up by 40 percent during its term of ownership, AEW could not profit leasing space to its roster of tenants due to a continued downtown real estate depression and lower than average rental rates within the Tower.
In late 1997, the landmark tower was sold for $804 million to Toronto-based TrizecHahn, a REIT (real estate investment trust) firm. Downtown property markets subsequently began to show signs of recovery, and Sears Tower was again becoming one of Chicago's most prestigious high-rise properties. In fact, to honor Sears Tower's principal structural engineer, an adjacent street was, following a ceremony in the building, dedicated "Fazlur R. Khan Way" on July 7, 1998 by the City of Chicago.
Sears Tower, alongside John Hancock Center and Amoco Building, was the epitome of the Chicago skyscraper craze during the latter half of the 20th century  a time when the American economy was booming and tall buildings were a sign of commercial strength and success.
To meet the growing demands of the digital age, Sears Tower was upgraded March 8 of 2000 with four combination antennas, each 29.4-feet, 2890-lbs mounted on 80-foot towers at the four corners of the roof. An Erickson S-64F Aircrane was used to lift the load from the top of the parking garage skyward about one quarter mile. Four city blocks were closed off during the massive operation. However, the addition would ensure that the Chicago area was capable of receiving HDTV.
On June 4, 2000, the 220-foot western communications tower had to undergo modifications to increase the signal quality of Chicago's local NBC television station. This necessitated disassembling the existing framework via hellicopter and installing a new 75-foot, 19250-lb stack of self-supporting antenna pylons for WMAQ-29, WLS-52, and WPWR-52/22 on top of the existing support tower, thus raising the height of the building to 1729 feet.
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, however, the status of Sears Tower as a viable investment opportunity proved questionable. Trizec Properties Inc. finally transfered ownership to its lender, MetLife Inc., in August of 2003 after facing the growing possibility of defaulting on its mortgage. Less than one year later, however, MetLife sold its stake in the building outright to a group of three investors (including two of Larry Silverstein's group), thereby forming 233 South Wacker LLC.
The building was leased and managed by real estate firm CB Richard Ellis Inc. until 2007 when responsibilities were assigned to Chicago-based U.S. Equities Realty LLC. Seeking to revitalize and redevelop Sears Tower, owners have announced numerous "green initiatives", including possible LEED certification, aimed at reducing energy costs and positioning the Tower as a more attractive and eco-friendly destination for new tenants. Visionary plans to "paint" the building silver were also briefly considered, but never left the drawing room table.
Engineers sought different ways of emphasizing the city of ‘broad shoulders’, and the desire for Chicagoans (including their businesses) to always be bigger, bolder, and better. Sears Tower is perfectly reminiscient of a thriving, innovative period in Chicago architectural history.
The entire building has also undergone significant security improvements since 2001. Johnson Controls' Hillside office was awarded the contract to install various barricades along all street-level entrances, X-ray metal detectors in the main concourse, and electronic turnstile portals around the elevator lobby. Additionally, visitors now wishing to do business in the tower must sign-in at a security checkpoint. Any unidentified person will be immediately escorted out of the building by armed security officers.
Sears Tower's continued status as the tallest building in the western hemisphere was first published by SearsTower.org. Since that time, countless newspapers and books -- even the official Website -- have increasingly cited this fact as a popular alternative to the "tallest building in North America."
As of 2010, Sears Tower remains the tallest skyscraper in the western hemisphere and one of the largest office buildings (in rentable square footage) in the United States. It also maintains the title of the world's tallest steel-framed building.
Annually 1.3 million people visit the observation deck alone, making The Big Store the 7th most popular tourist destination in Chicago (Source: Chicago Tribune, Sept 14, 2006). In addition, a recent public poll conducted by the American Institute of Architects, in commemoration of its 150th anniversary, ranked Sears Tower as America's third favourite Chicago architectural landmark.
