Where is it located?
The Sears Tower is located on Wacker             Drive in Chicago, Illinois. This was a smart place to             construct it, because many people in the area were in             need of office space. The Sears Tower had a lot of space             to offer. When the Sears Tower was finished being built,             it was filled with about twelve thousand             workers.
