The newest Obama campaign ad hammers Mitt Romney's gubernatorial record, knocking him for leaving the state with more debt per capita than any other state and the 47th worst job creation record during his term as governor. The ad argues that Romney had "one of the worst economic records in the nation" and ties that record to 2012 by saying that Romney's economic philosophy "didn't work then" and "won't work now."
Although the ad doesn't reference Bain Capital or Mitt Romney's private sector record, it reflects the ongoing effort by the Obama campaign to undercut the core premise of Mitt Romney's campaign: that he has the experience to strengthen the economy. The ad will air in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
