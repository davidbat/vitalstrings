Incoming Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said Tuesday neither he nor his lieutenant governor will draw their state salaries while in office, citing what Romney's transition team called "a spirit of volunteerism."
The governor's salary in Massachusetts is $135,000 a year, while incoming Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey would have drawn $120,000 annually. Some of the money saved will be used to supplement the pay of senior advisers, Romney's office said.
"This is a symbolic move that we hope sets the appropriate tone and which demonstrates our strong commitment to public service," Romney said in a written statement Tuesday.

Romney, a Republican, led the organizing committee for the 2002 Winter Olympic games in Salt Lake City. He is the son of former Michigan governor, presidential candidate and American Motors chairman George Romney, who died in 1995.
Romney and Healey take office January 2.
