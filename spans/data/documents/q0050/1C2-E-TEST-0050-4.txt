Mitt Romney's campaign released a new ad on Friday highlighting his economic record as governor of Massachusetts. Titled "Strong Leadership," it is the fourth in a series of ads focused on envisioning "Day One" of a Romney presidency.
"As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney had the best jobs record in a decade," the narrator says. “He balanced every budget without raising taxes. He did it by bringing parties together to cut through gridlock.”
The ad also notes that Romney reduced the state's unemployment rate to 4.7 percent, and represents his campaign's first attempt to respond in an ad to the Obama campaign's numerous attacks on his record as Massachusetts governor.
In similar vein to Romney's previous ad , the new spot does not mention President Barack Obama.
