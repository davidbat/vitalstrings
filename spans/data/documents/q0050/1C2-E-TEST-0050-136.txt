Massachusetts'                  political heritage can clearly been seen its current political                  dynamic. The state's collective ideology is divided into equal                  parts colonial Yankee rigidity, Kennedy Family idealism, blue-collar                  conservatism and intellectual progressiveness.

Candidate            Profile:
State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien was born in the rural Western Massachusetts            town of Easthampton. She currently resides in Whitman with her husband            Emmet Hayes, a businessman and former lobbyist. O'Brien was elected            to the state legislature in 1986 at the age of 27. She later went on            to be the first woman to hold the office of state treasurer, a position            she has held since 1998. She looks to have strong support among female            voters, being the first woman in the state's history to be a major party's            nominee for governor. O' Brien is running on her management record in            the treasurer's office where she's been successful in cutting costs            and reducing the Commonwealth's debt. O'Brien has gained steadily on            Republican challenger Mitt Romney since winning the Democratic primary.            She hopes to be the first Democrat to hold the corner office at the            State House in twelve years.

Candidate Profile:
Mitt Romney is best known for being president of the Salt Lake City            Olympic Committee, where he was credited with fixing the financial problems            that had plagued the Committee before the games. Romney was born in            Bloomfield, Michigan, the son of Michigan Governor George Romney, and            currently resides in Belmont with his wife Ann. Romney lost a contentious            race for senate to Edward M. Kennedy in 1994. A venture capitalist,            Romney is the former CEO of Bain Capital & Company. Romney ran unopposed            in the Republican primary, but has lost his lead in the polls to Shannon            O'Brien in recent weeks. He is running on a platform of reform, citing            his experience in the private sector as qualification for fixing Massachusetts'            current budget crisis. Romney hopes to be the fourth Republican governor            in a row in Massachusetts.
