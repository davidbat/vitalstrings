Will Willard Mitt Romney, 63, be our next President? If so then he will certainly be in great physical shape.
It is said that he takes jogging seriously. What does that mean? It means that he tries to run four or five times a week, two to five miles at a time while on the campaign trail. Imagine what he does when he has time.
His sons tell stories of the annual Romney triathlon in New Hampshire where the Romney’s have a vacation home. This very active family runs, swim, and bikes.
Former Governor Romney doesn’t like to lose – even to his sons or their wives; however, one son, Matt, ran track and cross-country in high school. He usually wins.
Ann Romney, Mitt’s wife who has Multiple Sclerosis, helps Governor Romney stay in shape by baking him granola, which he carries with him in a one-gallon zip lock bag and eats every day for breakfast. That is a great tip for all to take note. If you put food in a bag you are much less to overeat – even in your own home. So take the box of cereal and put it into one-service portions.

Mitt eats lots of fruit, yogurt and drinks water. Remember that he is a Mormon so he doesn’t drink coffee.  On the road his favorite stops are Quiznos or Subway turkey sandwiches. He eats chicken, fish or pasta for dinner. His cheats are Big Macs and chocolate malts.
Mr. Romney and Ann Romney live in Belmont, MA. He earned a joint law degree and MBA at Harvard University.
