Is Mitt Romney                the "economic conservative" he claims to be? Especially when it                comes to tax and spend policies?
Now that he's                running for president, let's compare his words with his deeds.
Taxes
Romney claims                to be anti-tax. He even "took" a "no new taxes" pledge when he ran                for Governor of Massachusetts in 2002. "Took" is in quotes because                he refused to sign that pledge. His signature wasn't necessary,                he claimed. He assured us that he's a man of his word.
But Mitt Romney                has been a champion of new taxes.
Mitt Romney proposed three new taxes while campaigning for governor:                a new tax on vehicles, a new tax on campaign donations, and a new                tax on building construction. They didn't get much fanfare in the                media and were quickly forgotten.
Right before                the 2002 election, he ran millions of dollars in ads portraying                himself as a "no new taxes" governor. The media refused to set the                record straight.
But that was                only the beginning.
Each of the                four years Romney served as governor, he raised taxes  while pretending he didn't. He claims he only raised mandatory government                "fees." But government mandatory fees are nothing but taxes, and                taxes are nothing but mandatory government fees. Romney's new tax-fees                raised hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax revenue for the                state government every year.
He also increased                several taxes by "closing loopholes" to enable collection of a new                Internet sales tax and by passing legislation that enables local                governments to raise business property taxes. This, he claims, is                not raising taxes.
I suppose you                could say Romney merely enacted bills that force taxpayers to hand                over billions of dollars  which end up in the coffers of the                government.
Quacks like                a tax increase?
Romney now                boasts that he was the first presidential candidate to sign a "taxpayer                protection pledge," in which he promised to oppose "any and all                efforts" to increase income taxes on people or businesses.
So he'll call                his tax increases "government fees" or "closing loopholes" or something                else. But if Romney is president, the IRS will collect this money                from you, your family, your friends, and millions of Americans just                like you.
Government                Spending
Mitt Romney                claims to have cut the Massachusetts budget by "$2 billion." Sometimes                he claims he cut it "$3 billion." The media gives him free advertising                by parroting this myth repeatedly. They repeat it so often that                even some libertarians assume it must be true.
But these "cuts"                were merely budget games. Spending cuts in one area were simply                moved into another area of the budget.
In fact, not                only did Mitt Romney refuse to cut the overall Massachusetts budget,                he expanded it. Dramatically.
The Massachusetts                state budget was $22.7 billion a year when he took office in January                of 2003.
When he left                office four years later, it was over $25.7 billion  plus                another $2.2 billion in spending that the legislature took "off                budget." (Romney never reminds us of this fact.)
The net effect                of budgets proposed and signed into law by Mitt Romney? An additional                $5.2 billion in state spending  and a similar increase                in new taxes. Every year.
He claims to                have done a good job as governor of liberal Massachusetts in light                of the fact that it's a "tough state" for poor "conservatives" like                him. He infers his hands were tied by the predominantly Democratic                legislature.
But when it                comes to tax and spend policies, he's not only in lockstep with                the Democrats. He leads the way.
Each of the                four years Romney served as governor, he started budget negotiations                by proposing an increase of about $1 billion. Before the legislature                even named a budget figure.
Romney initiated massive new spending  without any prodding.
The legislature                responded with a handful of line item budget increases. Romney agreed                to some of them and vetoed others. The media helped him out again                by making fanfare of his vetoes and portraying him as tough on spending  after he had already given away the store!
The Romney-Kennedy                Alliance
But his grande                finale was the worst of all: RomneyCare, Mitt Romney's version of                socialized medicine.
By his own                admission, he didn't plan his socialized medicine scheme until after                the 2002 election.
During Romney’s                governor campaign, he convinced voters that his Democrat rival would                be worse  because she would saddle us with socialist tax-and-spend                policies, he said.
But soon after                he was elected, Romney started the drumbeat for socialized medicine.                Three years later, he signed RomneyCare into law.
Voters of Massachusetts                did not vote for RomneyCare. Mitt Romney foisted the granddaddy                of Big Government expansions upon them without warning. He championed                it from the beginning. Again, without any prodding from his Democrat                rivals.
When Romney                ran for U.S. Senate in 1994, his campaign popularized the derogatory                term "Kennedy country" to describe the devastating effects of Ted                Kennedy's "liberal social programs" on poor neighborhoods in Massachusetts.
Yet Mitt Romney                stood proudly with Kennedy while he signed RomneyCare into law.
Ted Kennedy                has pushed for socialized medicine for decades. Romney fulfilled                his dream. Kennedy lobbied the legislature hard to get Romney's                bill passed. It was a Romney-Kennedy alliance.
Welcome to                Massachusetts: Romney-Kennedy country.
Romney's socialized                medicine law mandates everyone who doesn't have insurance to buy                it  or suffer income tax penalties. There's yet another "off                budget" Mitt Romney tax increase.
Romney's mandate                will cost individual taxpayers many thousands of dollars every year                in health insurance premiums for unwanted policies  or                force them to pay the equivalent in tax penalties.
The total cost                of RomneyCare in mandates and new spending? At least several billion                dollars every year – to start. It will rise from there, as socialized                medicine programs are wont to do.
Romney's law                goes into full effect in 2009. Unless it's repealed before then,                the loudest screams of protest from Massachusetts won't be heard                until after the 2008 presidential election is over. Romney's time-release                tax increase.
Romney’s                Words Versus Romney’s Deeds
Smart moms                tell their kids, "Believe none of what you hear and half of                what you see."
That advice                saved me a lot of heartache. And it will do the same for Republicans                who are leaning towards voting for Mitt Romney in the Republican                presidential primary.
Candidate Romney                campaigns for president with the words we’re aching to hear. Words                we want to believe. Candidate Romney tells us that he is a:
"fiscal                  conservative"
