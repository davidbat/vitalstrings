Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007
Former Gov. Mitt Romney's self-described position on choice has shifted from pro-choice to anti-choice.
As governor, Romney vetoed a bill giving rape survivors information about and timely access to emergency contraception. Fortunately, the Massachusetts state legislature voted to override Romney's veto. 1
In April 2012, two anti-choice groups, the National Right to Life Committee and the Susan B. Anthony List, endorsed Gov. Romney for president. 2
Former Gov. Romney  has said repeatedly that he would be an anti-choice president:
In 2007, former Gov. Romney said, "I will be a pro-life president." 3
That same year he also said, "I am pro-life and I support pro-life legislation…. I think the Roe v. Wade one-size-fits-all approach is wrong." 4
When asked if the repeal of Roe v. Wade would be a good day for America, former Gov. Romney responded, "Absolutely." 5
Former Gov. Romney also said "absolutely" when asked, "Would you have supported a constitutional amendment that would have established the definition of life at conception?" 6
Vowing to defund Planned Parenthood, former Gov. Romney wrote that he would "eliminate Title X family planning programs," which includes federal funding for birth control and cancer screenings. 7
In discussing how he would address the country’s debt, former Gov. Romney responded, "Of course you get rid of Obamacare, that’s the easy one, but there are others," he said. "Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that." 8
He even vowed to eliminate President Obama's policy ensuring that women can get contraceptive coverage without a copay. He called the policy "a violation of conscience." 9
