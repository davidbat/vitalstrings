Mass. Gov. Patrick on Mitt Romney's jobs record, says fees added during his administration 'still a tax'
The Obama campaign is launching a new attack strategy today after weeks of hitting GOP candidate Mitt Romney for his work at Bain Capital.  The new tact aims at Romney's record as governor of Massachusetts, trying to discredit the Republican nominee's time spent there.
This morning, Obama senior strategist David Axelrod led a news conference in front of the state house in Boston to try to push that message as well.
On "Starting Point" this morning, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick (D-Mass.) talks with Soledad, and response to the criticism leveled at Romney for his job creation record. He also says that the fees added during Romney's administration are similar to taxes. When pressed on President Obama's recent polling, Patrick makes a statement that takes Soledad by surprise, emphatically stating "I don't care about polls."
