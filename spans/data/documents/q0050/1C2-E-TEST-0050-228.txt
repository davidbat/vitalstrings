Romney Cut Funding For Early Education, Literacy Programs And Head Start
Romney Vetoed A Universal Pre-Kindergarten Bill And “Questioned The Benefits” Of Early Education. According to the Telegram and Gazette, “State legislators are hopeful that the universal pre-kindergarten bill former Republican Gov. Mitt Romney vetoed last year will become law now that Democrat Gov. Deval L. Patrick is in the executive office… Both legislative branches passed the bill in August, but Mr. Romney blocked it, saying it would be too expensive. He also questioned the benefits of early education.” [Telegram And Gazette, 2/2/07]
Romney’s Proposed Eliminating Early Literacy Programs And Full Day Kindergarten. According to the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, “Balancing this modest increase is a substantial cut to other K-12 education spending, including the elimination of early literacy, full-day kindergarten, and class size reduction programs, a steep cut in funding for regional school transportation, and the transfer (without adequate funding) of the state’s early education program for three to five year olds. Combined with the cuts to non-education local aid discussed above, which will put heavy pressure on local government budgets, it is clear that the progress made since the passage of Education Reform in 1993 will be gravely threatened.” [ Massachusetts Budget And Policy Center, 3/5/03 ]
