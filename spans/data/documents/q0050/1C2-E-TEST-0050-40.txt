June 23, 2012
A political committee supporting President Barack Obama is out with a new ad accusing Mitt Romney of making millions while shutting down an Indiana paper plant.       The ad, from Priorities USA Action, is the latest in a series attacking Romney's record at the investment firm Bain Capital. The group says it's spending $10 million to air a total of four ads in Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.       The new ad features an employee of the AMPAD plant in Marion, Ind., Mike Earnest, recalling being told to build a stage from which company officials later announced mass layoffs.

Where are Mitt Romney’s details?
June 27, 2012 | Scot Lehigh
When Mitt Romney ran for governor in 2002, he campaigned like the management consultant he had once been, digging deep into issues and proposing thoughtful plans based on his analysis of the facts. It was a winning performance.       A decade later, however, it's as if an anti-matter Mitt is running for president. This Romney takes regular refuge in vague answers and foggy formulations. And not just on caught-by-surprise matters such as President Obama's new policy not to deport certain young illegal immigrants.

Mitt and the junk bond king
June 24, 2012 | Michael Kranish and Beth Healy, Globe Staff
It was at the height of the 1980s buyout boom when Mitt Romney went in search of $300 million to finance one of the most lucrative deals he would ever manage. The man who would help provide the money was none other than the famed junk-bond king Michael Milken.       What transpired would become not just one of the most profitable leveraged buyouts of the era, but also one of the most revealing stories of Romney's Bain Capital career. It showed how he pivoted from being a relatively cautious investor to risking his reputation for a big payoff.

Romney ends primary season with win in Utah
June 27, 2012 | Stephen Ohlemacher, Associated Press
Mitt Romney has won the Utah Republican presidential primary, the last contest of a primary season that started with a crowded field in January and ended with Romney the only candidate campaigning for votes.       Romney already had more than enough delegates to claim the GOP nomination. On Tuesday night he won all 40 delegates in Utah.       Nebraska will hold its GOP state convention in July, but Utah held the last presidential primary on Tuesday, almost six months after Romney narrowly lost the Iowa caucuses to former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.

Romney says immigration law has become a ‘muddle’
June 25, 2012 | Jack Gillum, Associated Press
Mitt Romney on Monday said the Supreme Court should have given states "more latitude" to deal with immigration than the justices allowed when they struck down key parts of Arizona's tough immigration enforcement law.       The likely Republican nominee declined to address the specifics of the court's decision to uphold the Arizona law's "show me your papers" requirement but prohibit police officers from arresting people on minor immigration charges, taking...

Mass. Republicans oust Ron Paul delegates
June 24, 2012 | Stephanie Ebbert
Evan Kenney had just turned 18 and registered to vote for the first time when he campaigned to be an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention. Lauding Ronald Reagan's principles and blasting Keynesian economics at the Lynnfield caucus in April, the Wakefield High School senior beat out several well-known Massachusetts Republicans, including the party's most recent nominee for governor, Charles D. Baker Jr.       But earlier this month, Kenney was one of 17 delegates and alternates disqualified by a Republican committee deciding who gets to represent...

On tour, a looser and largely gaffe-free Romney
June 19, 2012 | Kasie Hunt, Associated Press
The personal stories were slightly awkward. The small-town events tended toward the corny. His chats with voters were usually just a few words. But as Mitt Romney campaigned across six states, he loosened up a little — and avoided the verbal gaffes that had plagued him in the past.       "Pie time!" Romney exclaimed as he walked behind the counter at Sweetie-licious Bakery Cafe in DeWitt, Mich. A rolling pin and lump of pie dough waiting, he rejected the bright pink apron the store's proprietor tried to give him. He spotted a red apron and tied it around his waist.

Obama and Biden strike at Romney on overseas jobs
June 26, 2012 | Ken Thomas, Associated Press
President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden unleashed a back-to-back assault Tuesday on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, re-emphasizing Democratic assertions that Romney as a venture capitalist sent U.S. jobs overseas and paid no heed to the impact on American workers.       "You've got to give Mitt Romney credit," Biden said while campaigning in Iowa. "He's a job creator in Singapore, China, India.

Mitt Romney’s prankster ways continued in college
June 24, 2012 | Michael Kranish
Lewis Black vividly recalls the day when his Stanford University classmate, Mitt Romney, put on a police uniform, walked behind a mutual friend, and ­announced gravely, "You're ­under arrest. "      It was, Black said in an inter­view, just one aspect of Romney's continuation of a prank he had begun during his high school years: impersonating a police officer. Black said Romney was known to put a police-like whirring cherry top on his white Rambler, put on a uniform, and ride around in a "fake police car. "       "I remembered him telling us that he liked to...

Obama to speak at Urban League conference
June 27, 2012
President Barack Obama will address the National Urban League Conference on July 25 in New Orleans.       The conference by one of the nation's oldest civil rights organizations is focused on increasing employment for African-Americans, who now face a jobless rate of 13.6 percent, nearly 5 percentage points higher than the national average.       Obama has widespread support among black voters. But the high unemployment has prompted African-American leaders in the past to appeal to Obama to resist making deep cuts to programs that benefit urban communities.

Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren lambasted Republican Mitt Romney Monday as she introduced his general election opponent, President Obama, at a Boston fund-raiser.       Teeing off on the former Massachusetts governor, Warren told a full house at Symphony Hall: "Mitt Romney tells us, in his own words, he believes corporations are people. No, Mitt, corporations are NOT people. People have hearts. They have kids. They get jobs. They get sick. They love and they cry and they dance.

Romney prepares for court’s decision on health care law
June 26, 2012 | Matt Viser
WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court's ruling on President Obama's health care law may be two days away, but Mitt Romney on Tuesday offered a preview of how he'll respond.       If the law is rejected, Romney plans to argue that Obama wasted both his time, and the time of the American people, by pursuing a policy that doesn't pass constitutional muster. If the law is upheld, Romney would argue that opponents need to elect him so that he can overturn it himself.       "If Obamacare is not deemed constitutional, then the first three-and-a-half years of this...

Obama, Romney key: Win wavering voters
June 25, 2012 | Globe Staff
They shrug at President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. They're in no hurry to decide which one to support in the White House race. And they will have a big say in determining who wins the White House.       One-quarter of US voters are persuadable, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll, and both Obama and Romney will spend the next four months trying to convince these fickle, hard-to-reach individuals that only he has what it takes to fix an ailing nation.       Until November, Obama and Romney will spend huge amounts of time and money trying to win their votes, especially...

No fruition for Romney on major higher ed plans
June 20, 2012 | Mary Carmichael, Globe Staff
Mitt Romney rarely visited the University of Massachusetts as governor, but on July 18, 2005, he called a news conference at the system's Boston campus. It was sweltering out, but he barely broke a sweat. Standing in an underground parking garage so dilapidated it endangered the buildings above, he pledged $50 million for repairs.       What happened next would be part of a pattern marking his four-year effort to change higher education. His plan went nowhere.       Romney introduced a bill that could have paid for the garage, but he did not include a specific earmark for the project - a...

GOP senators won’t say if Obama plan is amnesty
June 19, 2012 | David Espo, AP Special Correspondent
When it comes to President Barack Obama's new immigration policy, Senate Republicans are quite sure they don't like it. They just don't want to say if it amounts to amnesty, at least not yet, while they await guidance on the politically charged issue from presidential candidate Mitt Romney.       "If it leads to citizenship as a reward for some kind of illegal entry, I think it could be argued" to be amnesty, said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who normally is one of Obama's most plainspoken critics.
