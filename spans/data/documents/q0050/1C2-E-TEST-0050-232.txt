Don't know who said it 1st, but  man's true character is proven during hard times...Newt's true character is showing...he doesn't even believe it anymore...
Too bad for the Religious Right and Tea Baggers...no one to vote for this November.

I don't believe Newt knows the difference between denying and lying. In fact, I don't believe Newt....period.

Like we should ever believe anything Newt tries to pass on.     He is a bully,  and a liar,  who loves to blame anybody else for his mistakes.

If his pants ignited every time he lied, he'd have the hottest poker in Washington.

Holocaust survivors, who for the first time, were forced to eat non-kosher, because Romney thought $5 was too much to pay for our grandparents to eat kosher."
Are you kidding me??? FOR THE FIRST TIME? Wow...who knew that Auschwitz and Bergen Belsen served kosher, and it was Evil Mitt Romney who finally "forced" non-kosher food? I'm so grateful to Newt Gingrich and his minions for clarifying history for me. What a miscarriage of justice that the Nazi camp guards were never credited with respecting the religious beliefs of their prisoners...

My prediction:  Newt becomes the GOP nominee (which he has assured us he will).  He gets the Lincoln-Douglas debates he's been asking for â€“ with the 150-year-old debate style and everything. And he totally trounces Obama and also proves to the world not just how smart Newt really is, but also that Obama's birth certificate is a fake.   And we'll be lobbing missiles at Iran soon, too.   But I still have just one question:  Can we please have Mitt sing the National Anthem at Newt's inauguration?
BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

Why doesn't someone with some cojones in the media ask the newterman to repeat "Spanish is the ghetto language" and how he is going to teach blacks to earn a paycheck instead of receiving welfare.
That would go over really well in Florida and the rest of the country.

I am sure if this bill was put before Mr. Gingrich, he would suggest the senior citizens clean the toilets at their nursing home to defray the cost of kosher meals and tell us how the elderly have no work ethics as they expect other people to take care of them.

This guy is like the sline that grows at the bottom of a watering pail left outside. If he wins, I'm leaving the country.

Still on the kosher gambit, Newt?  The whole "denying Holocaust survivors kosher food" thing really adds an exquisite touch to the overall pandering for Florida's elderly Jewish vote.  What would Saul Alinsky think?

Well, it is Newt, so everybody knows he's lying about not knowing anything, just sayin'!
