Romney Economics:
It didn’t work in Massachusetts, and it won’t work now.
Mitt Romney ran for governor of Massachusetts promising more jobs, less debt, and smaller government. Here’s what Massachusetts got instead:
Jobs : 47th out of 50 states in job creation
Taxes and fees : Increased by $750 million per year
Long-term debt : Increased more than $2.6 billion
Outsourcing : State jobs outsourced overseas
Manufacturing : Jobs declined at twice the national rate
Romney Economics didn't work then, and won't work now.
