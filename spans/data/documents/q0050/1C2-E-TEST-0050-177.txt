As Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney cut taxes, balanced the budget, & wiped out a $3 billion deficit?
..and left behind a $2 billion rainy day fund. America didn't have trillion dollar deficits until President Obama. Since he took office, we've seen four. We have a President who spends more than he takes in. It’s wrong, it’s immoral and it must stop.
Vote for Mitt Romney in November for a better, brighter America.
