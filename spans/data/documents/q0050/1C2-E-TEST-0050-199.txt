Bruce Willis: Mitt Romney is 'a disappointment, an embarrassment'
Esquire
By Gael Fashingbauer Cooper
Bruce Willis is no fan of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
In an interview for the cover story of the June/July issue of Esquire magazine , Willis tells a reporter he's not exactly pleased with the former Massachusetts governor.
"He's just such a disappointment, an embarrassment," the actor tells writer Tom Chiarella. "He's just one of those guys, one of those guys who says he's going to change everything. And he'll get in there, and they'll smile at him and introduce themselves: 'We're Congress, we make sure nothing changes.' He won't do it. He can't. Everybody wants to be Barack Obama. And what did he change?"

When asked if he thinks Romney will win the election, Willis told the writer "No," and added "I don't really care."
He also called Romney "the Dash Riprock" of the Republican party, referring to Elly May Clampett's handsome and conceited suitor  from "The Beverly Hillbillies."
Willis has supported both Democratic and Republican candidates in the past. In 2006, he told reporters, "I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government."
