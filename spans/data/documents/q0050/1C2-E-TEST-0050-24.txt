the concealment of all records,
who is this Barry guy in the WH?,
where are all the jobs jobs jobs jobs…….
Gonna be a long busy summer for the lame stream media to keep trying to protect someone who’s walls are tumbling down before their very eyes…….the people are finally waking up and seeing first hand what a disaster Barry and socialism is to this Country!!
Even everything they throw at Romney back fires.
Romney bullied a boy—–Barry bullied a little girl,
Romney put his dog on the roof—–Barry ate his dog,
Bain capital bad—–Now high profile Democrats coming out in support of Bain capital.
Most important, the media has lost their credibility because of their shilling for Barry

The fact that Romney never mentions being a governor is telling enough. All he wants to talk about is being a businessman but running a business is not like running a country, being a governor is more like it. And as a Governor is suck factor was high.

I will be happy to proceed. He still pretends like he wasn’t governor there. Yeah, so he mentioned it in passing. The fact that he is running on his epxperience at Bain as opposed to his time at Mass is telling. Let’s forget what happened when he was in charge and could actually use his Bain experience. All that matters is that he made money before he became governor. It didn’t work when he was governor but somehow it’s now supposed to work on a national level.

FYI: During Romney’s tenure as Governor, the MA legislature was fully and completely control by lunatic-left d-cRAT socialist extremists. Naturally, the socialist media will hide, misstate or misrepresent the distinction between the actions of the legislature and those of Romney in such a way as to falsely put Romney in a bad light. –Yes, they are that unethical, despicable and desperate to save their abysmal  failure, TheONE.

YUP, like in September 08 when the headlines screamed: McCain Leads Obama.
I forgot how that worked out. Care to help? LOL

I don’t remember any headlines screaming that.  But the Obama panic does look a lot like the McCain panic.

WHAT IS THERE TO REMEMBER?? Are we a country of freakin idiots? You sit in front of a machine on a network originally used for research! Its the EASIEST search you RINOs can do so that you recognize your (maybe not YOU) feeble inability to remember things from less than 4 years ago. SHEESH its just SAD how simple we are as a culture.

Obama is crazy to go so negative so soon.  You are supposed to save this stuff for September or October.
Don’t shoot your wad so soon, Barack.  You may need it later.

It takes the most delusional; braindead; fanatic; ideologue, to vote for Willard Romney with this dismal record of accomplishments.

I agree. It is Obama vs. the economy. Mitt isn’t even a consideration. If the economy continues to stagger, Obama will likely lose.  It does not look good, but time will tell.

“If the President could keep Democrats who aren’t running against him from undermining him” — that is a disturbing thought.  So the President should have absolute control over people?
