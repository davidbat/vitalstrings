Former Massachusetts Governor and Presidential Candidate to Support Walker in Wisconsin
Wauwatosa – Scott Walker, Milwaukee County executive and Republican nominee for governor, today announced that former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Mitt Romney would be joining him for events in Wisconsin on Monday, October 18th.
“Wisconsin is in desperate need of a leader like Scott Walker,” said Romney.  “Scott Walker knows that we can’t tax and spend our way back to prosperity, and his plan to bring 250,000 jobs focuses on lower taxes and getting government out of the way of the private sector.  As a businessman and former governor, I know Scott’s plan makes sense. Scott’s history as a reformer and his record of nine straight budgets that put taxpayers first are proof that Wisconsin taxpayers will be lucky to have someone like Scott Walker looking out for them in the capitol.”
“Governor Romney knows how to fight for jobs, balance a budget, and look out for the taxpayers,” said Walker.  I hope to follow Mitt’s example by keeping taxes low, and spending in check to improve our state’s job climate and allow the people of our state to create 250,000 jobs during my first term.  I’m thrilled Mitt can bring his record of reform to Wisconsin, and look forward to his visit.”
