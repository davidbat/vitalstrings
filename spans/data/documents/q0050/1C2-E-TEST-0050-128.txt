Romney book 
Mitt Romney’s Deception by Massachusetts researcher and activist Amy Contrada is a thorough history of the former Governor’s shocking (but under-reported) record on “gay rights”’ and “gay marriage” in Massachusetts. The book details Romney’s promises to homosexual activists, his resulting promotion of “gay rights” and unconstitutional implementation of “gay marriage,” and his support for sexual-radical programs in the Massachusetts schools. The outrages Romney failed to halt set horrible precedents for radical leftist victories nationwide. Contrary to his claim that he defended marriage, the Constitution, traditional values, and religious freedom, he actually undermined them. In addition, Romney’s actions are analyzed within the broader history of how “gay marriage” and the homosexual agenda in the schools came to Massachusetts – and ultimately to the rest of the country. It is a unique resource written by a pro-family activist on the frontlines of the culture war in Massachusetts.
Contrada’s research will prove invaluable in evaluating Mitt Romney as a Presidential candidate. Focusing on the issue of “gay rights,” Contrada documents his largely untold history as Governor. During those years (2003-2006), Romney:
· Worked closely with homosexual activists and pro-gay rights advisors
· Implemented “gay marriage” through his executive departments without legislative authorization, violating the Massachusetts Constitution
· Pushed a constitutional amendment strategy doomed to failure, and ignored the call to remove the activist judges who ruled for “gay marriage”
· Funded and promoted GLBT indoctrination in the public schools through his “Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth,” and his Department of Education “Safe Schools” programs
· Undermined religious freedom, failing to defend Catholic Charities in the “homosexual adoptions” fiasco
· Continued or implemented radical homosexual and transgender programs in his executive departments
The book covers gubernatorial candidate Romney’s refusal to support the original 2001 Massachusetts constitutional amendment to define marriage as one man and one woman (which the Legislature refused to vote on). It details the tainted Goodridge “gay marriage” ruling, the attempted “civil union” constitutional amendment by the Legislature (supported by Gov. Romney), the constitutional issues which were purposefully ignored, the grassroots effort to remove the judges, the “gay marriage” training sessions for Justices of the Peace and Town Clerks (run by Gov. Romney’s Chief Legal Counsel), the watered-down VoteOnMarriage amendment, what really happened with the Catholic Charities adoption issue (it's not what the media reported), and everything in between. The in-fighting, the shameful collapse of the conservative movement, and the treachery by so-called “conservative” leaders is all discussed.
Finally, this book is an unprecedented documentary of the homosexual agenda in Massachusetts schools starting in the early 1990s. This is particularly relevant to people across the country who are seeing the fruits of that “pioneering” work in their school systems now. Governor Romney's support of these radical programs (through his Dept. of Education and “Governor's Commission on Gay & Lesbian Youth”) is fully documented. From Kevin Jennings (who started out as a teacher in Concord Academy in Concord, Mass.) to the GLSEN conferences, "Safe Schools" programs, gay-straight alliance clubs, and Youth Pride events, to the parents’ rights violations in the David Parker nightmare case, this book documents how the homosexual movement literally took over the Massachusetts Department of Education -- and branched out to the Department of Social Services and throughout state government.
Mitt Romney’s Deception is a superbly documented, 640-page history with numerous photos and over 900 detailed endnotes.

"I have downloaded the sample from Amazon. I think the style is the most impressive feature. It respects the reader as a thinking person, and does not push. Particularly useful are the questions that Amy asks under the photos, to really get the reader thinking and contemplating the history of our situation. And the skillful presentation of supporting documentation is almost as impressive as the style. Congratulations on completing this tour de force, which will stand on its own now, and help to guide conservatives all across the country in their deliberations."    
- T.L., Massachusetts (comment to MassResistance)
"Amy Contrada makes a monumental contribution to the precise documentation of the sordid history of the stealthy introduction of so-called 'gay marriage' in Massacusetts."   
- Davey Jay "Davey" (Amazon review, 1st ed.)
"This just downloaded to my PC. I started scanning the footnotes. All 847. I was jaw dropping shocked and over shocked at the stock of information gathering this lady has done. It is all there. Now it is up to you. You must have this book in your library. I want a hard copy too but the techno world we are all a part of is where this book breaks through. It will go down as one of the most compelling arguments and discoursed books in our generation."

WHY ISN'T THERE MORE COVERAGE OF MY BOOK IN THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA?
"Fearing the abuse of the anti-journalists, the 'respectable' conservative media, those with a serious and sober presence in New York and/or Washington, have become cautious to the point of cowardly. To date, not a single one of them has so much as commented on my book, let alone reviewed it."
