Warning           to voters – from lawyers, leaders and activists from Mass           and across US – The national conservative movement's "elites" are           covering up Romney's betrayals on homosexual agenda, constitution,           and other issues while Governor of Massachusetts.

How "Gay             Marriage" Came             to Massachusetts: Governor Mitt Romney's Failure in a Constitutional             Crisis
E-Book – $4.95 on Amazon .         Kindle Edition; can be read on any computer, IPhone,         IPad, etc., with         free reading apps (i.e., you do not need a Kindle device). With over         50 exclusive color photos and almost 300 detailed endnotes with live         links.
The focus of these chapters is the constitutional crisis of “gay         marriage” in Massachusetts (2002-2006) and Governor Mitt Romney’s         lack of leadership. While candidate Romney is now pledging to appoint         only strict constitutionalists to the federal bench, as Governor he unconstitutionally         enforced a Massachusetts high court ruling – enabling the judicial         activism he now says he opposes. Despite his claims that he did all he         could to protect marriage, Romney’s failure to uphold the Massachusetts         Constitution resulted in the illegal issuance of null-and-void marriage         licenses to same-sex couples. Further, he had failed to support a strong,         early marriage amendment proposal, and his later assurances that a constitutional         amendment was sure to pass proved false.
Romney vs. Family Values: The Romney Administration's Radical Homosexual Programs Targeting Children in Massachusetts
E-Book – $4.95 on Amazon .       Kindle Edition; can be read on any computer, IPhone,       IPad, etc., with free       reading apps (i.e., you do not need a Kindle device). With over 330 detailed       endnotes with live links, and over 90 color photos.
Massachusetts has been the incubator for harmful sexual-radical programs         directed at children. It was, after all, through the Governor’s         Commission on Gay & Lesbian Youth that Kevin Jennings (GLSEN founder, “Fistgate” maestro,         and Obama “Safe Schools Czar”) got his start in the early         1990s. Governor Romney was in reality an enabler of sexual radicals whose         goal is the destruction of traditional family values. Yet, Romney claims         to believe in traditional marriage and every child needing a home with         a father and a mother. Also includes the real history of the Catholic         Charities - homosexual adoptions fiasco, and radical training sessions         in Romney's Dept. of Social Services.
 
Beware the RINO stalking the political countryside!
