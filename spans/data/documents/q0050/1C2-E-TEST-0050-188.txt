Debate on Bain Capital and Mitt Romney's involvement
 
Obama                                  Campaign Attacks with new ad: this time Ampad
 
According                                  to the Washingtpn Post's Fact Checker :
 
As                                  we said at the beginning, the Obama campaign ad                                  depicts the facts fairly straight. But we going                                  to award a Pinocchio because this particular story                                  of these unfortunate workers is taken out of context                                  from Bain’s overall record. It’s also                                  not entirely clear how much Romney was responsible                                  for the decision to treat the workers in this                                  manner, but he was the chief executive, so he                                  certainly has the ultimate responsibility. The                                  Ampad transaction, until its final days, also                                  largely tracks with Romney’s active leadership                                  of Bain, making it fair game for scrutiny of his record as a business executive.
Was                                  GS Technologies a Turnaround situation?
After                                  taking a barrage of ads by the Obama                                  campaign , many have countered that, contrary                                  to the claim (or at least implication) that Bain                                  simply gutted                                  GST Steel for profit , Bain actually took an                                  ailing company and prolonged its existence.
On                                  the other hand, according to an article in The                                  Times-News at the time:
While Armco lost money through the first half                                  of 1993, the World Wide Grinding Systems unit                                  posted an operating profit of $8.9 million on                                  sales of $197.6 million.

One of the common defenses of Bain Capital (or                                  private equity in general) has been that they                                  take on troubled companies. But reports show that,                                  to the contrary, they                                  generally invest in profitable companies .
 
World                                  Wide Grinding Systems was Armco's Kansas City-based                                  division that it sold to Bain. It would later                                  be renamed GS Technologies. It's no secret that                                  the steel industry faced a rough crisis, and this                                  is when GST went under. However,                                  some critics claim that the imposed debt burden                                  (largely used to pay dividends) left GST less                                  able to weather the storm . There is also the                                  awkward situation that Bain                                  Capital profited even as the steelmaker went bankrupt                                  and workers were denied severance pay and the                                  government had to cover the underfunded pension                                  plan .
Whether                                  or not Mitt Romney's private equity created more                                  than jobs than it lost, or whether we decide that                                  private equity is 'good' or 'bad' (it seems there                                  are examples of both), one thing we should take                                  care to NOT do is conflate                                  this debate on Romney's job creation with an attack                                  on capitalism . Under this set of rules, profit                                  is clearly not contingent on growing companies                                  and certainly not on creating jonbs..
 
With                                  the 2012 election just around the corner, the                                  economy (and people's perception of who can do                                  a better job to improve the economy) will likely                                  decide the election. Mitt Romney has taken up                                  the “Job creator” mantle, and is using                                  his private sector background as a platform to                                  support this claim. His job creator claim focuses                                  on two points in history; 1- His time as CEO of                                  Bain Capital and 2- His time as Governor of Massachusetts.                                  The Mitt Romney Job Creation website was created                                  in order to stay on top of these claims and filter                                  through the noise that so often accompanies anything                                  politically-related.
 
Bain                                  Capital
Mitt                                  Romney’s time at Bain would indeed see the                                  creation of certain jobs. Unfortunately it would                                  also see the loss of jobs in others. The question                                  is: Was there a net increase in jobs? And if so,                                  how many? Romney claims to have created a net                                  of 100,000 jobs. But records have yet to be released                                  and therefore this claim is impossible to verify.                                  If anything, it would seem that the opposite is                                  true.
In his book, The                                  Buyout of America: How Private Equity Will Cause                                  the Next Great Credit Crisis , Josh Kosman                                  lays out the history of Bain Capital (and other                                  private equity firms) have of "purchasing" companies through leveraged buyouts, gutting thse                                  companies (lay offs, slashing R&D budgets)                                  for profits (ie through dividend payouts and selling                                  the company off). Often times these companies are unable to sustain themselves for much longer                                  because the PE firm's focus was on short term                                  profits (which often comes at the expense of long                                  term health). Here is a graph from the book.
