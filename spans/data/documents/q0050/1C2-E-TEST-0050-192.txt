Mitt         Romney Says He Was Never Pro-Choice on Abortion as Mass Governor

Washington,             DC (LifeNews.com) – Mitt Romney is likely one of several Republican             candidates who will vie for the GOP nomination and the right to take             on pro-abortion President Barack Obama. For his 2008 attempt at representing             Republicans, Romney caused consternation by talking about his position             change on abortion and he is doing it again.
Appearing             on the "Imus in the Morning" radio program with Don Imus             this morning, Imus asked Romney to revisit his position change.
"Well,             you know, I never really called myself pro-choice, but I did say when             I was running for governor that I would keep the law as it was," Romney said.
But             that appears to contradict what he said at the 2007 GOP Iowa straw             poll debate.
"Look,             I was pro-choice. I am pro-life. You can go back to YouTube and look             at what I said in 1994. I never said I was pro-choice, but my position             was effectively pro-choice. I changed my position. And I get tired             of people that are holier-than-thou because they’ve been pro-life             longer than I have," he said then.
American             Spectator writer W. James Antle noticed the Imus comment and said             Romney could hurt his own chances of getting the nomination in 2012             by revisiting his former position in favor of legal abortions.
"Romney’s             problem has never really been that he changed his mind. It has been             the fact that he can’t resist insulting people’s intelligence about             his past record when discussing his current position," Antle             writes.
"This             is a perfect political climate for Romney to downplay abortion and             run as an economic problem-solver. But if he continues to pretend             he was never pro-choice or play word games about his previous stance,             abortion will plague his candidacy again in 2012," Antle continues.
For             pro-life advocates, overturning the Roe v. Wade abortion decision             so abortion can again be prohibited has always been a hallmark of             a true pro-life stance.
During             a January 2008 campaign stop in Nevada, Romney             said he lined up with the pro-life movement against Roe.
"I             am pro-life, and I would welcome a time when the people of America             concluded that abortion was wrong, but that’s not where America is,             and that’s why I believe that the next right step for America is for             the court to overturn Roe v. Wade," he said. "That would             return to the states and to the elected representatives of the people             the ability to set their own laws related to abortion."
Romney             converted to a pro-life position after years of supporting legalized             abortion.
He             also said during the 2008 presidential campaign that he supports a             federal human life amendment as a second goal after first toppling             Roe and letting states ban abortions again.
Any             Republican taking on Obama would face a president who has compiled             a lengthy pro-abortion             record .
