Unlike the 105 years it will take before Venus is again observable between the Earth and Sun , we'll never go a single day without seeing the phenomenon of political hypocrisy.
Last Thursday, Mitt Romney held a "very special episode on government spending" press conference in front of Solyndra's closed headquarters, hoping to drive home his argument that government shouldn't be in the business of picking winners and losers in the private sector. That privilege belongs to venture capitalists, who also pick the players, the game, the rules, the winners and then charge you for parking.
But, lo and behold, Romney had his own little Solyndra back in Massachusetts …
A Lowell-based solar technology company that received $1.5 million in state loans when Mitt Romney was governor has filed for bankruptcy, opening the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to charges of hypocrisy.
Konarka Technologies disclosed Friday that it had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and would fire its 80-member staff and liquidate its assets.
The two companies are actually very similar. Both had promising business plans and raised millions of dollars in private investment as well as federal grants. They also began getting funding under the oil and coal lovin' Bush administration.
Great news, right? That means we can all agree that both Republicans and Democrats think solar energy is important enough to invest in and work together on, even if it means taking an occasional loss. Did you laugh out loud at that sentence? It was probably the funniest thing ever written.
Stay tuned for other astronomical events this week when Romney responds to the Konara story, and be sure not to look straight at the total eclipse of the truth.
