Mitt Romney (R)
Former governor of Massachusetts
Romney announced on June 2, 2011, in New Hampshire that he would run for president in 2012. On that day, he asserted that President Barack Obama "has failed America" and that "from my first day in office my number one job will be to see that America once again is number in job creation."  Read more...
Romney, who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2008, is the former governor of Massachusetts, serving in that capacity from 2003 to 2007.
Early as it may be, some political watchers consider Romney the front-runner for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, as he easily won a New Hampshire Republican Party straw poll in January 2011. Romney has maintained an active political action committee, the Free and Strong America PAC , which raised $9.1 million and spent $8.7 million during the 2010 election cycle.
During his 2008 presidential bid , Romney was an effective fund-raiser, collecting more than $107 million -- second only to the ultimate GOP nominee, John McCain. But winning the money race wasn't enough to win his party's favor. Romney dropped out of the race after disappointing Super Tuesday results in February, when McCain solidified his position as the party's frontrunner. In all, Romney won 11 primaries or caucuses during the 2008 presidential election.
Romney raised $88.5 million in 2007 alone, but $35.4 million of that came from his own pocket: He has amassed a fortune estimated to be worth as much as $250 million as a former chief executive of a management consulting firm and co-founder of a private equity investment. Romney, born in 1947, spent more than any other candidate on advertising in the early primary states during 2008, but his message didn't seem to resonate as well as his campaign had hoped.
Romney's political career also includes an unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid in 1994, during which he lost to Democratic incumbent Ted Kennedy.
