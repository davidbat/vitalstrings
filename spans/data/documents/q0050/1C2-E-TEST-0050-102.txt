to help at the Security Council. There are reasons to be optimistic for
China
’s role. We can’t sit idle waiting for more cooperation. We should consider a strategy that the governments and clerics are not the sole sources of power. People in
Iran
are a great source of power. They have not been as radicalized by their government and clerics because of fear from economic backlashes. There are more than 75,000 bloggers active in
Iran
today. This is a successful strategy on our part!
We see five major dimensions. We need tighter economic sanctions: our model should be as severe as they were with apartheid
South Africa
. The Bush administration deserves credit for our track so far. The
United States
and Europe should ensure that
Iran
gets little financial credit for anything and should make it difficult for
Iran
to get currencies. We need to send a message to the Iranian leaders and to the Iranian people that the world is not happy.
We need to impose diplomatic isolation with
Iran
. Ahmedinijad should not be given the clout he is given when going abroad. The world should isolate him. Ahmedinijad should not be invited to foreign capitals nor fךted by foreign diplomats. The message should also include an indictment of Ahmedinijad under the Genocide Convention. The
U.S.
should lead this. One of the major points of the Genocide Convention is public incitement to incite genocide is a punishable crime.
Arab states must join this effort to prevent a nuclear
Iran
. These states can do much more than just wring their hands and encourage
America
to act. They should support
Iraq
’s new government. They can help by turning down the heat on the Palestine-Israeli conflict. Telling Palestinians to stop executing terror in
Israel
and stopping the flow of weapons to groups like Hamas and Hezbollah is important. There also needs to be a recognition of the State of Israel’s right to exist.
Iran
needs to understand that a military option remains on the table. The nuclear material that
Iran
develops could fall into the hands of terrorists and, if used, could find a massive military strike against those responsible.
Our strategy should be integrated into a broader approach. NATO should be included in defeating radical Islam. On one hand there is a capable military- this is key. This is a greater investment of the
U.S.
and other nations. On the other hand there is a global partnership for progress that involves NATO and other organizations. This partnership should help provide the tools necessary for moderate Islamic governments to succeed in their societies. In the final analysis of it all, only Muslims will be able to defeat radical Islam but we could, and should, help!
Attempting to defeat totalitarianism in the last century did not always show that the west would win. We were afraid of major losses. We did not lose though. In the current conflict, we can lose only by not lifting a finger to help ourselves. It is time for the world to speak three truths: 1)
