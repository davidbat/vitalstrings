Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, a purported 2008 presidential candidate,  is behind all of his likely rivals for re-election in the latest polls.
From Ron Gunzberger
A new University of Massachusetts poll shows Governor Mitt Romney (R) trailing any of his potential 2006 re-election opponents. Romney trails Attorney General Tom Reilly — the Dem frontrunner — by 15%. Secretary of State Bill Galvin and former USDOJ official Deval Patrick (D), by contrast, only leads Romney by single-digits. However, if Romney passes on the race to focus on a likely 2008 Presidential campaign, GOP chances of holding the Governor’s Mansion fade even further. The poll showed Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey (R) trails any of the Dems by wider margins than Romney. Healey trails Reilly by 25%, trails Galvin by 13%, and trails Patrick by 4%.
While it’s probably true that Romney would fare better in a national contest than in the liberal capital of the country, the prospect of a guy who can’t win re-election in his own state moving on to the presidency is quite bizarre.  Of course, Richard Nixon did just that, losing the California governor’s race in 1962 and then getting elected president in 1968 and 1972.
