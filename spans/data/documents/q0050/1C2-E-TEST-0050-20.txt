Riiiiight, nobody did coke in the 70′s, Dubya only did one drug at a time, and the classic ,”It wasn’t me, musta’ been some other guy named George W. Bush”.
If you believe all that BS, you must be high. Are you high right now?

Please point out the slander and lies for everyone and show your ignorance.
The media went so far as to fly to Alaska to “interview” Sarah Palin’s hairdresser in order to dig up dirt on her.
Here we have a story about Obama’s “Choom Gang” drug dealer that he personally thanks in his High School yearbook (instead of his own mother), who was murdered.
Something tells me that if the media wanted to dig up some dirt on a Presidential candidate, the case of Obama’s dead Gay drug dealer would be much more fertile ground than Sarah Palin’s hairdresser.

I know it’s hard for you sometimes, but you have to stay focused and try to understand that we are comparing Mitt Romney’s record with Barack Obama’s record, not Massachusetts record with California’s.

What “No name” is saying and what you are saying does not match… Its like ‘No Name” is speaking perfect english and you are speaking Spanish. “No Name” is speaking with bit of logic and you are speaking with emotions. You must be left handed… (I am btw). “Deal with the truth”. You from that crazy Boston btw? lol..

Neil,
Sorry but even as a conservative I find your references to Obama as Monkeyboy offensive. There are better ways to do it. FYI: I am even white.

You might want to ask all those people at Studio 54 if coke wasn’t the drug of choice in the 70′s.  Once again Seek is wrong.

 Funny how Obama didn’t prosecute your war criminal (Dumbya/Cheney and regime) and wall street scum heroes, he should be your hero for that. But somehow Obama needs a prosecution before all those other scumbags?
Wingnut logic always fails, you posted the proof of that fact one more time. Thanks!

I don’t always agree with Wallace’s politics, but he’s a great interviewer.
Anonymous
I think Wallace makes some good points.  Although Romney did see slight improvements in the economy over the course of his governorship, Obama has seen slight improvements in the economy over the course of his presidency.  Fact is that Romney’s record as governor is very similar to Obama’s record as president.  Kind of odd for one side to bash the other guy’s record while praising their own guy’s record.  Actually, it’s not odd, hypocrisy is common in politics.

take your time next time and read the whole thing.  while ma job growth was .9% under romney, states with similar high skill, high wage, knowledge economy base jobs, like california, were much, much higher.  
sure he had job growth at .9%, but the whole country had job growth at 5%.
not sure where you picked the job loss number but despite only adding 69,000 jobs last month, obama began his term with a loss of 750,000 a month. that’s a pretty big gain anyway you look at it.
 
the one sector that has been losing jobs is in government jobs, which is the goal of you yahoos.  
not sure why you hate teachers, police and fireman (i even remember you hypocrites turning your back on 9/11 first responder when they wanted health care.  ”we’ll never forget” my ass.)

Yea, that small factoid eluded a lot of the Republican establishment when they shoved this guy Romney down the throat of the rank and file while hammering Rick Santorum over his “18 percent loss” in the PA senate race.  In fact, Romney had only a 35% approval rating as governor and chickened out of a 2006 run.  HIs Lt. Gov, DID run — and she LOST by over 24 percentage points.
C’est la vie.  The GOP is top-down and they INSIST that rich white guys from the Northeast pull the strings of power.  But if their choice loses — AGAIN — there will be open rebellion among the GOP rank-and-file and you will see a much more activists, much more Republican, conservative, grass-roots oriented GOP.  (And I won’t be getting seven pieces of mail — A DAY — begging me to make a contribution to the Romney/RINO campaign — so I’ll have to find some other source for garden mulch.)

This was what makes the Sunday morning political shows occasionally worth watching — even if it is the exception rather than the rule.
Chris Wallace did a good job of submitting statistical data and Ed Gillespie did a somewhat decent job of presenting Romney’s record as he saw it.
I think we all get a little tired of the constant barrage of talking points, which are usually argued as broad ‘unchallenged’ generalities.
Somewhere Tim Russert is smiling.
http://gamewhen.com/ Michael T
You’re right. Romney wasn’t all that popular when he left office, with an approval  rating in the 30s.
Even the bombastic controversial Chris Christi and the recall-challenged Scott Walker have approval rating hovering around 50% — even higher in Christi’s case.

Actually, according to many Liberals, Obama HAS been a disaster.
Yes, but only for giving a damn what the Republican’s thought during his first two years, and not telling them to go f*ck themselves.
We really could have gotten alot more done had he acted like we were the party in power, rather than trying to be inclusive toward people who most of us more “radical” liberals knew damned well would never return the favor.
My only hope is that if we regain the house and keep the senate that he’s learned his lesson and gets everything done and tells the Republican’s to piss up a rope.
As much as I admire the President and the job he’s done, he really did screw us by giving the Republican’s any consideration whatsoever in 2009-2010.

 He is not a Democrat, they have standards that Wallace can not meet..

Chris Wallace is actually one of the FEW truly commendable hosts on Fox.  I’ll admit that he’s far from perfect, but he DOES have a good tendency to HOLD BOTH SIDES ACCOUNTABLE (not just the Left).  I mean, he even asked Carly Fiorina SEVEN TIMES what she’d do to help bring down the deficit in a big way, and she couldn’t even offer specifics!  
Shepard Smith is another great host I admire over there for speaking his mind and not ALWAYS towing the party line.  Billo and Sean Vannity could learn a few things from these two.

Romney’s a hypocrite, pure and simple.  He thinks that PRIVATE-SECTOR BAILOUTS OF INDUSTRY ARE A-OK (aka “private equity”), but USING TAX DOLLARS to do it is “wrong”, as if HE AND HIS FINANCIAL-SECTOR CRONIES KNOW SO MUCH BETTER how to “manage the econ.” or “fix failing companies.”  I really wonder if that “80% success rate” figure I keep hearing about is even REMOTELY true.  It sounds more like 20% to me.  I mean, the guy can only cite, like, FIVE companies (at best) that he as head of Bain Capital “saved”?? 3-5, including Domino’s, Staples and Sports Authority
Did Bain Capital ONLY take over, like, TEN companies while he was head?  
http://twitter.com/Brandon2469 Brandon
All this talk of “Let the economy work” and creative destruction are PHONY, at least if you support a guy like Romney.  If Romney and Co. TRULY believed in their BS, they’d LET THE COMPANIES FAIL, as is “proper” for the market to “progress”, right? Let bad companies die out and make way for better ones, as they always tell us.  But if there are OTHER companies TAKING OVER these ailing firms to “make them better” instead of just letting them die out (not that I’d want that; I’m just humoring conservatives here) to remove dead weight in the industry so NEWER AND BETTER competitors can step in, how is that “the free market” in action?  It’s just bailouts UNDER ANOTHER NAME, isn’t it?
http://twitter.com/Brandon2469 Brandon
Private equity? More like private bailouts
The PE-lovers and fans of Romney complain about GOVERNMENT bailouts simply b/c it’s not THEIR PRIVATE-SECTOR AND/OR WALL ST. CRONIES in charge of the bankruptcies, restructurings and whathaveyou.  It’s some “unproductive gov’t bureaucrat.”  But if the bailouts are managed by “business experts”, it’s A-OK, no matter how destructive the end results REALLY may be.
I mean, if Mitt Romney thinks we SHOULD NOT HAVE BAILED OUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY, why didn’t he SEE THE WARNING SIGNS AHEAD OF TIME and just have Bain take over GM and Chrysler ON ITS OWN??  You’re a giant fraud, Mitt.  This IDIOT who’s claiming to be a “huge expert in how the economy works” (does ANYONE really fully understand how an economy works, esp. a businessman who only ran a handful of companies IN THAT ECON.?) MERELY RAN A FIRM… WHICH DID NOTHING BUT TAKE OVER OTHER FIRMS! It didn’t PRODUCE anything new or create a new service that regular consumers wanted or needed.  The total NET VALUE that Romney’s Bain supposedly “added to the economy’s growth” is probably LESS THAN 1%.  But he’s claiming to be THIS BIG EXPERT ON ECONOMIC POLICY, all b/c he was a businessman.
What a load of GARBAGE!  What is it with conservative businessmen assuming that “Just because I created jobs and ran my own organization well, I’ll be able to do the same in Washington”, as if the rules ARE ENTIRELY THE SAME.  Except they AREN’T.  A president has to deal with gridlock, trying to unite 2 opposing sides and get them to compromise, having to consult the legislative and/or judicial branches on MOST EVERYTHING SUBSTANTIVE HE DOES, etc.  A CEO IS NOT nearly the equivalent of a governor or president.  And even those few people who’ve run MULTIPLE companies well DO NOT know how to RUN AN ENTIRE ECON.  One or two companies are BUT A MINISCULE FRACTION of all the companies in this country (some 9 million, I think).
Do we consider a doctor who dealt with cancer patients “just as much an expert on curing cancer” as a RESEARCH SCIENTIST at, say, a big university who did studies, examined data, etc. on a regular basis?

Much like the outrage about any righty having an affair but nobody should give a flying fig that Clinton got a b.j. under the very prestigious Presidential desk.  Again – you rational fools.  You’re rational all right – want to ration our money into your pockets.
