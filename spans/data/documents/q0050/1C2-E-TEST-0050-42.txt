Besides being the son of former Michigan Governor, George Romney, Mitt Romney maintained a fairly low profile until he took over as president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in preparation for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Before he took the position there were ethical and financial concerns about the games, but Romney spearheaded a successful event.   On a new wave of notoriety, Romney was elected as governor of Massachusetts in 2003, and is remembered for reducing a $3 billion deficit and passing a type of universal healthcare legislation.
