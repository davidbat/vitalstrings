Longtime Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank joins Jennifer Granholm in the War Room to talk about everything from campaign fundraising, the power of Tea Party Republicans and Mitt Romney’s record in his state. Frank watched Romney years ago, as the Michigan native became governor in Massachusetts. Romney quickly had his eyes on a bigger role in Washington D.C., Frank recalls, having not just Potomac fever – but a “Potomac Ebola virus.” The GOP presidential candidate has a knack for twisting his record in his home state, Frank adds. “There’s a technical term about the way he approaches his role there,” the congressman tells Jennifer. “He lies about it.”
