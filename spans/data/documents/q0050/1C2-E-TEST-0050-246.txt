Story is about the complete remodel of the famed Carolands mansion. Former Chronicle staffer Judy Richter will be there, doing a preliminary interview with the homeownwers, Ann Johnson and her husband, and either they or Meg Starr, the estate manager, will take you both on a tour of the house; then Judy will finish her interview after you've finished photographing. We will need a good exterior shot as well as spectacular interiors, portraits of the homeowners in situ, and any details that they are particularly excited about.
