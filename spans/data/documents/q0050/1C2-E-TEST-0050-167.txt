Romney's record of fee hikes and taxes became an issue in the 2006 governor's race, with the Boston Globe reporting that "Fees and taxes have increased more than $700 million a year under Governor Mitt Romney and Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey, a leading budget specialist said." The analysis, by The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, pegged Romney's fee hikes and tax revenue increases at $740 million to $750 million a year.1
What's more: Romney "forcing [tax] increases at the local level."
In addition to the three quarters of a billion dollars in higher fees and state taxes Romney imposed as governor, his tenure also saw massive increases in property taxes in Massachusetts---in significant part due to Mitt Romney.  In fact, the non-partisan and highly respected FactCheck.org says Romney "shifted some of the tax burden to the local level" and "to some extent Romney avoided a state tax increase only by forcing increases at the local level." 2
Among his first acts as governor in 2003, Romney imposed massive cuts to "Local Aid:" the cash transfers from state coffers to cities and towns that are a crucial element of local budgets for schools, emergency services and more in Massachusetts. In February 2003, Romney unilaterally cut $114 million from Local Aid accounts and proposed a budget cutting $232 million more.3 The Boston Globe has said Romney's "local aid cuts forced cities and towns to cut services and raise property taxes."
Massachusetts homeowners paid a steep price for Romney's shell game. The average single-family property tax bill statewide rose from $3,015 in fiscal 2002 to $3,799 in 2006, a 26 percent increase, or $784 a year.4 During the same period, the residential property tax levy (that is, the total amount collected) increased by $1.8 billion statewide, or a staggering 35 percent  from fiscal 2002 to 2006.5
