I was trying to think of something nice to say about some person that was hospitalized in some foreign country , so i found nothing that would merit nice, so nothing said, is best, but I would suggest fumigating the emergency vehicle before its put back in service again.  What ever it may have been, could be contagious, I will check on occasion; of any outbreaks in that country.
