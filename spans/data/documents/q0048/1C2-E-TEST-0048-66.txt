Jews in political news: Jack Lew, Steve Israel on the hotseat

 After one of those “holds” that has nothing to do with the person being considered for high office, the Senate has  confirmed Jacob “Jack” Lew as director of the Office of Management and Budget.  Lew, who is now deputy secretary of state, held the OMB job at the end of the Clinton administration.
Lew has always struck me as one of the smartest people in Jewish/public life, which leads to this question: if he's so smart, why does he want this thankless job?
