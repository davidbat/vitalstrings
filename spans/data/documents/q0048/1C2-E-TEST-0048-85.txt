Whoa! CBS anchor destroys Nancy Pelosi
Monday, Jun 6, 2011 at 1:17 PM EDT
CBS reporter Bob Schieffer decided to ask Nancy Pelosi the tough questions and cornered her on her Congress’s record on the economy. How did she react? Let’s just say you could stamp ‘hypocrite’ on her forehead after this.
“We’re talking in kind of a different way, when unemployment went to 5% under George Bush.  What you said then, that Americans are struggling with skyrocketing energy prices, gas was only $3 a gas then, and you say this morning this is January 4th, 2008, this morning’s job report confirms what most Americans already knew.  President Bush’s economic policies have failed our country’s middle class.  I mean, aren’t Republicans entitled to say, you know, if gas was $3 and unemployment was 5% and the President has failed the American people, don’t they have a right to say that this President has failed the American people?” Schieffer asked (emphasis ours).
Her response?
“Well, if you want to go into the past, we can talk about the past all you want,” she said before adding that Americans are looking to the future.
Unfortunately, this comes from a woman and an administration that has defined their entire time in office by the actions and ‘failures’ of the Bush administration – refusing to take responsibility for any economic turmoil.
“You said you were going to create jobs with healthcare,” Glenn yelled.
Stu pointed out that they failed to keep unemployment below 8%.
“ She will be remembered as one of the greatest, most powerful Speakers of the House the United States has ever had.  She got it done.  I don’t care how bad you are. She got it done,” Glenn said in reference to healthcare.
“It’s not her getting that done. The tough job there is the Senate. It’s not the House,” Stu argued.
