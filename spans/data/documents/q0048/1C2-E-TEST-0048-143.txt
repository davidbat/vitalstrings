“should it be legal for lawmakers to buy stocks in companies directly affected by their legislative efforts?”
Why is this NOT illegal already?  Private sector investors are barred from buying stock if they are in a position to perhaps receive insider information; if you sit on the Board of a company, you may be barred from investing in any number of other stocks because in your position as a Board member in one spot, you may have a conflict with others.  Why on earth would Congress be exempt?  Oh, yes, that’s right….”all animals are equal but some animals are MORE equal than others”…doesn’t that just sum up Pelosi and her ilk (and I would include Republicans in her ilk if they’re doing the same thing).  Who buys $1m to $5m of any ONE stock, especially in the current climate, without some interesting insider knowledge and influence that other investors are not privvy to?
I smell utter corruption, wafting from the East… time to clean house and start over.

What we need is Newt Gingrich for president, and Bill Clinton for Speaker of the House ! That ought to get Nancy out of office. Maybe harry reid should be dog-catcher or something.

Well this is one bi-partisan agreement that neither party is willing to change. I understand why this is written about Queen Pelosi, but there were a number of Republican lawmakers cited in the 60 minutes information concerning stock trading including Boehner.
And some still wonder why congressional approval is in the low teens.They must live under a rock.
