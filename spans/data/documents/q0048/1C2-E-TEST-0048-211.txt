Buried in a Washington Post story about Herman Cain calling Nancy Pelosi , "Princess Nancy" is a new policy idea that Pelosi has been pitching recently during her short tour through California.
"One of the great pieces of unfinished business is high-quality child care; I wonder why we just can’t do that,’’ she recently said to a California audience. 
By "we", Pelosi means the federal government. Pelosi clarified that Congress should be  “doing for child care what we did for health-care reform.”

According to Pelosi, the babysitting market — one of the last unregulated sectors of the American economy — is broken. 
“I could never get a babysitter — have five kids in six years and no one wants to come to your house. . . . And everywhere I go, women say the same thing,” she said. 
This is an odd thing for Pelosi to be hearing since her San Francisco district has more dogs than children . 
Perhaps after Pelosi boosts the economy by separating mothers from their gross offspring, she can work on "unleashing" dog-owners on the economy as well.
