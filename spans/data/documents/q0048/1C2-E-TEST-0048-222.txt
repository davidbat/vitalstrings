Nancy Pelosi,          Insurmountably Racist Pelosi support for racial          preferences in education seem to be grounded in old-fashioned racism (Apr.          9, 2003)
Nancy Pelosi:          Drug Kingpin, Extortionist Pelosi is crusading          against American tobacco exports, seeking to punish American shareholders          and American workers for selling a product that people in other countries          want to buy. But her motives don't seem to be very pure (Feb. 28, 2003)
Who is Nancy          Pelosi? According to the San Francisco Chronicle,          Nancy is not merely a latte liberal, she is also a forward looking liberal,          an "Italian-American grandmother of five" and a vindictive political          operator. The latter two also describe someone else we know. (Nov. 18,          2002)
Pelosi vs the Extremists Pelosi's allies call her "pragmatic and inclusive",          while she in turn labels Republicans as "extremists". A whirlwind          tour of Nancy's press releases raises the question: what does one mean          by "extremist"? (Nov. 11, 2002)
An          Endorsement from the Chronicle The San Francisco          Chronicle endorses Pelosi for Minority Leader, on both the editorial and the news pages. Meanwhile, Pelosi faces another challenge, this time from          the left. (Nov. 8, 2002).
The          San Francisco Chronicle puts a gushing puff profile          of Nancy on the front page (Nov. 4, 2002)
More          Pelosi Sleaze : Nancy seems to have not one but two PACs all to herself, which is an apparent violation of the          campaign finance laws she helped          pass . (Oct. 25, 2002)
Forward          into the Past : Nancy has her very own Political          Action Committee called " PAC          to the Future ". But its idea of the "Future" is not          an encouraging one. The PAC gave mainly to paleoliberal museum pieces,          such as David Bonior, and irrelevant lunatics such as Cynthia McKinney.          (Oct. 22, 2002) [Fortunately most of her recipients lost their elections          on Nov. 5]
" Solidarity          Forever, because the unions pay me money ": Nancy          does more for big labor unions (if not for actual working people) than          almost any other Congressman, perhaps because big          labor unions give her more money than they give to almost any other          Congressman. (Oct. 17, 2002)
Whip          Nancy : As House Democratic Whip, Nancy is in a          strong position to become Speaker of the House of Representatives if/when          the Democrats retake control of the House. [Should she succeed Gephardt          as Minority Leader, her chances of becoming the next Democratic Speaker          are even stronger]. But does America really want a Speaker from the McGovern-McKinney          wing of the Democratic Party? (Oct. 14, 2002)
Ditzkrieg : Nancy's insipid speech opposing the use of force against          Saddam Hussein persuaded me that Nancy is too spacy to be assigned a serious          role in much of anything, let alone influence on national security policy.          Surely the House Democrats can come up with leaders who are wiser and          more grounded in reality? (Oct. 9, 2002)
