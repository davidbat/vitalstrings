i was in need of a loan and have been scam five times by online scammers , till a friend of mine directed me to

Clinton was impeached for getting a blow job,something every male in the world gets weekly now we have a president who is destroying a entire nation and we are just turning our heads and letting him get away with it, A little out of balance I would say.

Can we call for the President’s impeachment yet? Or her husband too? Maybe have them deported back to their country? Have the people arrested for even getting them on the ticket? And all the animals that elected him wrestled to the ground by his s.s. I mean secret service, and jailed for their acts of terror against the U.S.? I don;t think he can get away with blaming this on Bush. Well, it is America, some stupid folks might believe it, but still.

PUT THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE AND DON’T LET CONGRESS GET AWAY WITH IT.  ANY CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE HAS THE RIGHT TO AFFORD A WITNESS TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION AND THEN THEY HAVE TO TALK TO THE COMMITTEE OR THEY GO TO JAIL. THEY CAN’T TAKE THE 5TH AFTER AN IMMUNITY IS GIVEN.  LET THEM PICK OUT THE WEAKEST OF THE 535 MILLION DOLLAR SOLAR BOYS AND GIVE THEM THE IMMUNITY AND WATCH HIM IMPLICATE THEM ALL.  WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS NOT THAT THE MONEY IS GONE WITH A BANKRUPTCY – WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS WHERE THE HELL DID THE MONEY GO? AND TO WHO? AND WHEN ? THAT’S WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW! AND I CAN’T BELIEVE
ALL THESE SMART NEWS HOUNDS DON’T KNOW ABOUT THE ABOVE AND THAT IT WOULD APPLY IN THIS INSTANCE IF THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE DEMANDED IT.

Take notice that i have applied to the Department of Energy in Washington for a grant and/or a loan “whichever was avalible at the time for a green technology for which i have developed along with seven engineers. My product is proven to save billions of gallons of water and reduce the carbon footprint by trillions of pounds, not in the future “but imediately” we asked for a simple one million dollars needed to bring this to market, we also let them know that we could secure 3/4 of this loan with real estate. We were told that we did not fit the criteria because it appears that we have already establish the technology, “That their program is for Research and development only.
I wrote back to them and let them know that what good is the research and development when that tech is not put to use, they had Shumers office call me to put me in a program that has no money to give and wasted six months of my time. Now the department of energy gives out 737 million to a technology that is as well established and in use today, what security did they provide for this loan, besides who they know. I remain
