Nancy Pelosi Rips House Speaker John Boehner on 'Perfectly Absurd' Debt Bill: VIDEO
On Saturday, Rep. Nancy Pelosi spent eight minutes blasting House Republicans and John Boehner for declaring, "The bill is not perfect but we did our level best."
Said Pelosi: "[Boehner] chose to go to the dark side by putting forth a bill that he himself told his members would sink it in the Senate, and I add, lead to default."
Meanwhile, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) appeared on MSNBC and called the ultimate deal "a sugar-coated Satan sandwich."
The NY Times calls the deal "terrible", put together "to escape chaos." I haven't written much at all about this circus all week, though I'm sure you have some thoughts on the final agreement. Please tell us what they are.
