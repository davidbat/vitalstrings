Just a quick reminder that not everybody had a bad year :
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) saw her net worth rise 62 percent last year, cementing her status as one of the wealthiest members of Congress.
Pelosi was worth at least $35.2 million in the 2010 calendar year, according to a financial disclosure report released Wednesday. She reported a minimum of $43.4 million in assets and about $8.2 in liabilities.
For 2009, Pelosi reported a minimum net worth of $21.7 million.
Recession? What recession?
It’s good to know she’s still there fighting for the middle class .
Disclosure summaries for other key lawmakers are here .
