We know, we know — we’re still looking at that headline in disbelief, too. But Nancy Pelosi, the former Speaker of the House who lets her husband pick out her clothes , won some major style points when she showed up to last night’s state dinner for German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a “very old” two-piece ensemble from crazy pants designer Thierry Mugler . Does Nicola Formichetti know about this yet?
We guess it makes sense to wear a German designer to honor the leader of the German government — and it makes even more sense when that German designer’s clothes look really, really good on you.  The white ribbed jacket and floor-length skirt were appropriate for the occasion and flattering on Pelosi’s figure. Is this a sign that ladies in Washington are taking what they wear more seriously thanks to the First Lady? Or was this Paul Pelosi‘s way of auditioning to be Michelle Obama‘s next stylist? Because if he is still picking out Nancy’s clothes, he knocked this outfit out of the park.
