Nancy Pelosi Campaign Finance Violations
Last Updated: December 09, 2011
Synopsis
In May 2008, Judicial Watch filed a campaign finance complaint with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) against Nancy Pelosi for her appearance in an advertisement which was part of the “We Campaign” paid for by Al Gore’s Alliance for Climate Protection. In June 2009, the FEC announced that it had dismissed our complaint and that the advertisement was not electioneering nor an “in-kind” donation.
