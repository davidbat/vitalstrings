Nancy Pelosi: “God Bless” Wall Street Occupiers…
Leave it to Pelosi to “God bless” a group of godless leftists.
(Politico) — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday praised the thousands of “Occupy Wall Street” protesters crowding New York City and other cities across the nation.
“God bless them for their spontaneity,” Pelosi told reporters. “It’s young, it’s spontaneous, it’s focused and it’s going to be effective.”
he comments from Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, came after President Barack Obama embraced the protesters in a nationally televised news conference, saying their furor would “express itself politically in 2012 and beyond.”
The rallies — aimed mostly at the financial industry — are now in their third week. Wednesday’s protest in Manhattan marked the largest demonstration thus far, drawing a crowd of thousands and the support of major union organizations.
Pelosi on Thursday said the protests could bring more visibility to Democrats’ efforts to counter Republican attempts to weaken the Dodd-Frank financial oversight bill and block a permanent director to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
“The focus is on Wall Street and justifiably so,” Pelosi said. “The message of the American people is that no longer . . . will the recklessness of some on Wall Street cause massive joblessness on Main Street.”
