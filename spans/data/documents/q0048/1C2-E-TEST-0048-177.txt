Pelosi was involved with politics from an early age. In her outgoing remarks as the 60th Speaker of the House, Pelosi noted that she had been present at John F. Kennedy's inaugural address as President in January 1961. She graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame , a Catholic all-girls high school in Baltimore, and from Trinity College (now Trinity Washington University ) in Washington, D.C. , in 1962 with a B.A. in political science . Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) alongside future House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer .<ref>Jonathan Weisman and Lois Romano (November 16, 2006).

Phillip Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala . In late 1986, Sala became ill with cancer and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts.<ref name="nationnewface">" Is this the new face of the Democratic Party? ," The Nation .

Democrats have held the seat since 1949, and Republicans , who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. Pelosi has kept this tradition going. She won the seat in her own right in 1988 and has been reelected 10 more times with no substantive opposition, winning by an average of 75 percent of the vote.

[ edit ] Democratic Party leadership
In 2001, Pelosi was elected the House Minority Whip , second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri . She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.
In 2002, after Gephardt resigned as minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election , Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in the House.<ref> Speaker Nancy Pelosi , U.S. House of Representatives Official Web Page .

[ edit ] Blocking of impeachment proceedings against President Bush
In the wake of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed that Democrats should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president . They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by authorizing wiretaps without a warrant .
In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming congressional elections – which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994 – Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was "off the table". (A week earlier, she had told the Washington Post that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, "you never know where" investigations might lead.)<ref>Babington, Charles. "Democrats Won't Try To Impeach President" , Washington Post, May 12, 2006 . Retrieved February 3, 2010.</ref>
After becoming Speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan , who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.<ref>"Sheehan considers challenge to Pelosi", by Angela K. Brown, Associated Press , July 8, 2007.</ref>
[ edit ] Speaker of the House
[ edit ] Democratic nomination and election as Speaker
On November 16, 2006, Pelosi was unanimously chosen by her caucus as the Democratic candidate for Speaker, effectively making her Speaker-elect. While the Speaker is elected by the full House membership, in modern practice the election is a formality, since the Speaker always comes from the majority party.
Pelosi supported her longtime friend, John Murtha of Pennsylvania , for the position of House Majority Leader , the second-ranking post in the House Democratic caucus. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland , who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.<ref>Molly Hooper (November 16, 2006).

However, Hoyer was elected as House Majority Leader over Murtha by a margin of 149-86 within the caucus.<ref name="CNN"> "Democrats defy Pelosi, elect Hoyer House leader" . Reuters.

With her election, Pelosi became the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the Speakership. She is also the second Speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains . The first was Washington 's Tom Foley , the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.
During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the position of Speaker:
"This is a historic moment — for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling . For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them".<ref name=110speech>SFGate.com (2006). Text of Nancy Pelosi's speech . Retrieved January 6, 2007.</ref>
She also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:
"The election of 2006 was a call to change — not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end."<ref name=110speech/>
As Speaker, Pelosi is still the leader of the House Democrats; the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of his or her House caucus. However, by tradition, she does not normally participate in debate (though she has the right to do so), and almost never votes on the floor. She is also not a member of any House committees.
Pelosi was re-elected Speaker in 2009.
A CBS News poll conducted in March, 2010 found that 37% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of the speaker, with 11% approving.<ref>Montopoli, Brian (2010-03-22).

[ edit ] The "Hundred Hours"
Main article: 100-Hour Plan
Prior to the U.S. 2006 midterm elections , Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly-empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress' term.<ref> "Office of the Majority Leader Steny Hoyer" . Democraticleader.house.gov. 2010-06-10. http://democraticleader.house.gov/media/press.cfm?pressReleaseID=1624 . Retrieved 2010-06-14. </ref>
The origin for the name "first hundred hours" is a play on words derived from former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's promise for quick action on the part of government (to combat the Great Depression ) during his "first hundred days" in office. Newt Gingrich , who became Speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement the Contract with America .

On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from President Bush's confidantes that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi joined with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to condemn the plan. They sent Bush a letter saying, "[T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain. ... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror."<ref>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) (01/05/2007).
