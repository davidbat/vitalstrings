Nancy Pelosi is an American politician who is best known for her current status as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.
Its been a few years since the plastic surgery rumors began to swirl around Nancy Pelosi, and even now the whispers are still heard from time to time and from blog to blog.
When the plastic surgery speculation was at its peak, the suggested procedures included a facelift, eye lift, chemical peels and most notoriously, botox.
And while all of this was and is nothing more than hearsay, if Nancy Pelosi did in fact undergo plastic surgery, it was in the form of botox injections, appose to any nip/tuck operations. At least that's how i see it.
The photo above is one of many comically photoshopped images of Nancy Pelosi that has made its way around the internet more than a few times.
