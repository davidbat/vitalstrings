Rachel interviewed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi at an event held in the Leader's honor at the Sewall-Belmont House & Museum in Washington, D.C. this afternoon. The two discussed the Leader's work on HIV/AIDS, her support for women's rights during her 25 years of service in the House, and how the Leader's past continues to influence her work in politics to this day.
