House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., leveled a harsh critique against Republican presidential front-runner Mitt Romney on Tuesday, stating in no uncertain terms that she does not believe he poses a real threat to President Obama's re-election if he becomes the nominee.
"He's not going to be president," Pelosi said at a Washington breakfast hosted by Politico.
The U.S. House's top Democrat argued that Romney's inability to shore up the GOP base is proof that even his own party doubts he can defeat Obama in November.
"Here's the point. Just to bottom line it. If the far right thought Mitt Romney could win they might be more enthusiastic about him, but they question what he stands for. And they don't think he's going to win. So, you know, what's his sell?" she said.
Ryan Williams, a spokesman for Romney, said the campaign was unfazed by Pelosi's analysis.
"President Obama and his liberal allies know that if they have to face Mitt Romney in the general election, they are going to lose," he said, adding that Democrats "are willing to do and say anything" to distract from Obama's record.
Pelosi did not directly call Romney a flip-flopper, but her point was clear. "I'm not sure he knows what he stands for, and that makes it harder too, because that doesn't instill confidence as to where he might be on some issues," she said, adding: "I really don't know him. I don't know who knows him. Does he know him?
Pelosi's disdain was not limited to Romney. Referencing the Monday night Fox News presidential debate in South Carolina, the California Democrat dismissed the entire GOP line-up of contenders. "This crowd that they have there is not exactly what you would call the first string of the Republican Party. I mean, I think they can do better than that."
She dodged a question on who could do better for the GOP. "I would never say," she said.
