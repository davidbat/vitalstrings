Featured Members of Congress
On January 22, 2010 Nancy Pelosi was featured on the homepage of OpenCongress:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi [D, CA-8] said on Thursday, Jan. 21 that <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/1478-Pelosi-Talks-Health-Care">the House does not have the votes</a> to pass the <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3590/show">Senate's health care bill</a>. If they did have the votes, the bill could be signed into law without having to face another vote in the Senate where the Dems no longer hold a filibuster-proof majority. But she added: “We have to get a bill passed — we know that. That’s a predicate that we all subscribe to.”
