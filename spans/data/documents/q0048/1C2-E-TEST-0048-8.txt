House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Tuesday told CNN's John King that she's confident former House Speaker Newt Gingrich will never be president.
King asked: "What goes through your mind when you think of the possibility ... that he would be the Republican nominee and that you could come back here next January or next February with a President Gingrich?"
Pelosi replied, "Let me just say this. That will never happen." She continued, unwavering, "There is something I know. The Republicans, if they choose to nominate him, that's their prerogative. I don't even think that's going to happen."
