Is Nancy from Mars?  She represents a Congressional District that is alien to most of the country, but she wields power on a national scale.  The same is true for Barney Frank and Harry Reid - a relatively small no. of voters voted for them.  She uses military combat type language - we will pole vault over the fence or we will parachute over the fence - the opinion polls clearly show the majority is against the welfare health scare buill.  She uses the term "American people" - the American people want their money back, Nancy.

I'm all about stringing Pelosi up assuming the $101,000 tab is for real. But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that the receipt you have pictured is not for "in-flight services". What Delta flight from DC to Cali sells 750ml bottles of booze? I looks like a liquor store receipt.
