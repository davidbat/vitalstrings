With the entry of former pizza CEO and talk show host Herman Cain into the 2012 presidential race, our fair state now boasts two presidential prospects.
This means PolitiFact Georgia has the pleasure of checking both of them.
Newt Gingrich, whose campaign offices are in Buckhead, earned a True on health care. Cain scored a Mostly True on his claim about food stamp use and False on a gaffe about the U.S. Constitution.Â 
Not to ignore national politics, we gave U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi a Pants on Fire for a chart she posted about the national debt. Her Republican counterpart, U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, earned a Mostly True for a statement he made on U.S. coal to the Atlanta Press Club.
Run, Georgia, run!

Final days of election: Dynamite! :
We're in the election's final stretch, and politicians have dynamite in their hands.
As our sister site PolitiFact National noted in an analysis of this election season's claims, "campaigns often begin with a kernel of truth. But then they stretch it, twist it and blow it up."
In Georgia, politicians went nuclear with claims on jobs, legislation on child abuse and ethics violations.
This week's wreckage could have been far worse. We ruled Mostly True on a claim by Democratic candidate for governor Roy Barnes.
But our overall analysis of the gubernatorial campaign shows that if we had a Nastymeter, it would have spun like the Wheelie ride at Six Flags Over Georgia.
Don't try this on an empty stomach, ladies and gentlemen.
