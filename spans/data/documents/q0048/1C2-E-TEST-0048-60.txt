Nancy Pelosi is standing up for Occupy Wall Street.
The former House Speaker wrote an email to potential donors on behalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee asking for financial support.
In the e-mail, obtained by the Washington Post on Tuesday, Pelosi cites a memo from a Washington lobbying firm, Clark Lytle Geduldig & Crandford that has proposed an $850,0000 plan to undermine Occupy Wall Street.
"If you need further proof that Congressional Republicans are putting big Wall Street banks before middle class families, look no further than an explosive memo prepared by former John Boehner staffers-turned-banking lobbyists," writes Pelosi.
The memo from the loybbying firm was obtained by MSNBC's "Up with Chris Hayes."
The California Democrat does not mention Occupy Wall Street by name, but details the plan as one to "attack and discredit grassroots citizen movements working to hold special interests accountable."
"The memo goes on to describe a Democratic victory in November as detrimental to Republican special interests.
“They know a Democratic Majority in Congress will fight for middle class families, and make sure that millionaires pay their fair share and close corporate tax loopholes," Pelosi adds, suggesting a contribution of $3 or more.
