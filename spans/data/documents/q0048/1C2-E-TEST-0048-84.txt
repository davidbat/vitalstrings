Washington (CNN) - House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday dismissed Sen. John McCain's accusation that the recent spate of leaks about U.S. intelligence operations was politically motivated, calling the claim a "really a sad statement."
After the White House characterized McCain's remarks as "grossly irresponsible" on Wednesday, the Arizona Republican stood his ground, releasing a tough statement that repeated his assertion.
