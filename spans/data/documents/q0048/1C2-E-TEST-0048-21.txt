In the "Source of Funds" chart, "Large Individual Contributions" refer to all contributions        from unique individuals aggregating to more than $200 within a cycle, and "Small Individual Contributions" refer to all contributions from unique individuals totaling $200 or less within a cycle.        (" Help! The numbers don't add up...")
The organizations themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations' PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those         individuals' immediate families. Organization totals include subsidiaries and affiliates.
