Nancy Pelosi exits lying
Outgoing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (let's just pause to savor that "outgoing" qualifier) exits with an immense lie :
At her final press conference as House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)  said, "Deficit reduction has been a high priority for us.  It is our  mantra, pay-as-you-go."
The numbers tell a different story.
When the Pelosi Democrats took control of Congress on January 4,  2007, the national debt stood at $8,670,596,242,973.04.  The last day of  the 111th Congress and Pelosi's Speakership on December 22, 2010 the  national debt was $13,858,529,371,601.09 - a roughly $5.2 trillion  increase in just four years. Furthermore, the year over year federal  deficit has roughly quadrupled during Pelosi's four years as speaker,  from $342 billion in fiscal year 2007 to an estimated $1.6 trillion at  the end of fiscal year 2010.
