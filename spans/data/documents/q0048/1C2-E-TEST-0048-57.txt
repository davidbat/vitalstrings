Pelosi accuses Catholics of having 'this conscience thing'
William Tate
After having some of her behind the scenes shenanigans exposed, Nancy Pelosi has turned to her friends in the MSM to help her with damage control. The effect is something akin to watching what scrambles out after you overturn a large rock.
Pelosi sought to defend herself from allegations that she and her husband made millions from insider trading in what the Washington Post calls a wide ranging interview . And she responded to Herman Cain's recent reference to her as "Princess Nancy," calling it clueless: "clueless in that you don't say something like that."
Unlike, for instance, when Pelosi charged that, in voting to allow health care providers a conscience exemption from providing abortions, Republicans "will be voting to say that women can die on the floor."
Pelosi conveniently ignored that the measure passed with Democrat support.
So, in Nancy's world, it's clueless to jokingly call Pelosi a princess, but okay for her to accuse Republican members of Congress of saying that women can just die on the floor? "They would!" she reiterated to the Post. "Again, whatever their intention is, this is the effect."
Before the reader can recover from her hypocrisy, Pelosi added a startling, if inadvertent, admission. Addressing the effects such legislation would have on Catholic health care providers, Pelosi said:
"I'm a devout Catholic and I honor my faith and love it . . . but they have this conscience thing." (Emphasis added.)
This conscience thing? As in, they have one?
And she called Cain clueless?
