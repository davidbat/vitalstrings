Presidential candidate Rick Santorum in Iowa this morning said he thinks a Democratic leader is “flat out wrong” for saying it would be better for a Boeing plant to unionize than shut down.
In an interview with CNBC on Friday , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that, in her opinion, she wouldn’t want to see a Boeing plant in South Carolina “close down.”
“I don’t think they close it down. I would hope that they would make it union,” Pelosi said.
It part of a high-profile debate that pits opponents of government intrusion against those who think a company that violates labor laws should be held accountable.
So far, the National Labor Relations Board itself has not taken any action, and Boeing’s South Carolina plants continue operations.
The NLRB’s acting general counsel filed a complaint in April against Boeing, accusing the company of illegally trying to punish union workers in Washington state by moving some production operations to a  new plant in South Carolina.
South Carolina is a right-to-work state where certain labor union actions are curbed. The NLRB complaint is still working its way through the legal process.
Republicans in Congress want to prevent the NLRB from in the future ordering an employer to shut down plants or relocate work, even if the company has violated labor laws. Democrats who control the U.S. Senate disagree.
Santorum, a Republican former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, said in a written statement this morning: “Simply put, government does not have the right to tell private companies where they can and can’t do business.
“South Carolina, Governor Haley, and Congressman Scott are working with Boeing to bring jobs to their state and they have every right to do so.”
Separately, Santorum spoke at a National Federation of Republican Assemblies convention in Des Moines this morning.
