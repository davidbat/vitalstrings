House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was heckled several times at a town hall meeting in response to her vote for the "Satan sandwich" debt ceiling bill in Oakland, California.
Pelosi received the crowd's wrath after touting that the Democrats were able to get no cuts in entitlements in the deal. However, this was still not enough.
"Sell-out!"  ...  "Why did you vote for it?" ... "You voted for that Satan sandwich!" were just some of the phrases that were yelled at Pelosi.
