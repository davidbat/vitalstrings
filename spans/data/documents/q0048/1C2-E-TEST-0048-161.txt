Congressional Republicans are doing all they can to discredit the Occupy Wall Street. House Majority leader Eric Cantor has gone to great lengths to call the group “growing mobs” while others insist the protesters are nothing more than a group of spoiled brats with a sense of entitlement.
But not Nancy Pelosi . In response to Cantor and the others the House Democratic Leader reminded Americans that Cantor was just fine with tea party protesters literally spitting on members of Congress.
Pelosi has not just spoken out against Cantor’s specific hypocrisy but also endorsed Occupy Wall Street, joining the growing ranks of Democrats coming out in support of the anti-plutocracy movement. “I support the message to the establishment, whether it’s Wall Street, the political establishment or the rest that change has to happen,” Pelosi said. “We cannot continue in a way that is not relevant to their lives, people are angry.”
Former Senator Russ Feingold also came out strongly in support of the movement and cautioned other Democrats from playing it too cautious with the populist upswell, echoing the sentiments also expressed by President Obama.
The protests have so far remained non-partisan, expressing disgust with Democrats as much as Republicans. But hopefully, Congressional Democrats see the power behind much of this movement as one that can bring them back to their true base. Without a doubt Democrats have a share of the blame in the policies that lead to the largest economic collapse since the Great Depression. But, in the current political structure, one that lacks any true third-party capable of producing truly progressive policy on both the local and national level, the best hope for justice for Wall Street’s crimes comes from Democrats. And it would appear at least some in Congress get that. Let’s just hope those involved in the movement do as well.
