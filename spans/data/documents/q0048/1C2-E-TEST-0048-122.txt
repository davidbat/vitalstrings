Pelosi On Israel
Pelosi is 100%                    behind Israel, and stated "The creation of the State of                    Israel is one of the miracles of the twentieth century."
Pelosi overlooks Israel’s brutal treatment of the                    Palestinians, and doesn't mention Israel’s massive nuclear,                    chemical and biological weapons arsenal. Pelosi’s view of                    Muslims versus Americans and Israelis is racist.
Regarding Iran
According to Pelosi, the biggest danger to Israel today                    comes from Iran, whose nuclear ambitions, though still                    unproved, also threaten the US.
Her perspective contains the seed                    of ominous things to come, because, after all, something will                    have to be done about Iran, right? Yes, and soon.
"If evidence of participation                    by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I                    will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore,                    the evidence in determining how the US deals with that nation                    or nations on other issues," she said.
