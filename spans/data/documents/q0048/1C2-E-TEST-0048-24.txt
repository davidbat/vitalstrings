Nancy Pelosi on today's vote : "What we're trying to do is save the world from the Republican budget. We're trying to save life on this planet as we know it today."
Why? What's so great about life on this planet as we know it today? Let liberals defend the status quo. We conservatives seek to improve life on this planet. If I could paraphrase Bobby Kennedy: There are those, like Nancy Pelosi, who look at things the way they are, and ask why. We dream of things that never were--like reducing domestic discretionary spending, year over year--and ask why not!
Or, to paraphrase another of Pelosi's predecessors: The liberals only interpret the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.
