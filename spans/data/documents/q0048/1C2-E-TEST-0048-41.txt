Welcome
Welcome to SpeakerPelosi.com. I want to thank you for joining me in our fight to move America forward. Together, we are making extraordinary progress on behalf of the American people, from making health care affordable for middle class families to creating clean energy jobs and providing tough new protections for credit cardholders. None of these historic victories would have been possible without the critical support of grassroots Democrats like you.
But as you know, in politics, there is no rest for the weary. There is still much work to be done and we will need your continued support. You can use the tools here at SpeakerPelosi.com to sign up for email updates, volunteer, register to vote, or make a financial contribution to help secure and strengthen our Democratic Majority.
On behalf of the House Democratic Caucus, thank you again for driving our success. We couldn’t do what we do without you.
