For those who missed it:
So… Newt Gingrich responded today by thanking Pelosi for the early Christmas present and noting “… if she’s suggesting she’s going to use material that she developed while she was on the ethics committee, that is a fundamental violation of the rules of the House and I would hope that members would immediately file charges against her the second she does it .”
Annnnnd now we’re being told (via Weasel Zippers ) – it would be cruel* of me to use the word ‘frantically’ – that what the former Speaker of the House really meant by her comments to TPM was that there was plenty of public record information about Newt Gingrich available.  Not that there was any private dirt.  Nope.  Not at all.
Representative Pelosi then went on to reveal that the Red Sox had won the 2004 World Series and that Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick has been indicted on felony charges.
I think that we can safely score this one as a win for Team Newt.  Seriously,  why did Nancy Pelosi not resign after 2010, again?
