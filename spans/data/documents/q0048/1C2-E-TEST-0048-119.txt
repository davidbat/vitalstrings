Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi lost her composure during a long rant on the House Floor Saturday, refusing to yield her time before accusing House Speaker John Boehner of going over "to the dark side."  
Pelosi called Boehner's bill "perfectly absurd, perfectly absurd" and accused him of creating a theatre of the absurd.
At one point, Rep. David Dreier (R-CA) attempted to interrupt and asked if she would yield.
She became furious and then yelled, "I will not yield."
Afterwards, she said Boehner "went to the dark side."
Democrats then tried to shout down Dreier after he called for civility and civil discourse. He also said some Republicans had asked that Pelosi's words be taken down -- alleging that she had broached decorum in the House with her language.
One House member told Fox News that Pelosi's remarks were "pretty far out there" especially coming from the minority leader. House rules prohibit perosnal references to other members when language on the floor may impugn the integrity or motives of another member.
Boehner spokesman Mike Steel released a statement about the incident:
"Speaker Boehner's long-standing support for a Balanced Budget Amendment has nothing to do with Darth Vader."
