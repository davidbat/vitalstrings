Nancy Pelosi and Other Dems Call on Weiner to Resign
Top Democratic leaders are now calling for the resignation of Congressman Anthony Weiner , saying his recent scandal is "an unacceptable distraction."
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says Weiner is in need of help and should seek some "without the pressures of being a member of Congress."
Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz released a statement today saying, "It is with great disappointment that I call on Representative Anthony Weiner to resign. The behavior he has exhibited is indefensible and Representative Weiner's continued service in Congress is untenable."
She continued, "This sordid affair has become an unacceptable distraction for Representative Weiner, his family, his constituents and the House -- and for the good of all, he should step aside and address those things that should be most important -- his and his family's well-being."
