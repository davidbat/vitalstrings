Nancy Pelosi provides Newt Gingrich ethics report
In case you haven’t been watching cable TV, two former House Speakers named Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich are having a bit of a fracas related to all that Gingrich baggage about which GOP primary voters in Iowa appear to be blissfully ignorant.
Pelosi, the San Francisco Democrat and now House minority leader, promised to release records that are public but haven’t seen much sunshine lately about the congressional ethics investigation of Gingrich back in the day.
Gingrich said that would be foul play and promised to retaliate, claiming Pelosi was threatening to disclose non-public information. But Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said Pelosi was “clearly referring to the extensive amount of information that is in the public record, including the comprehensive committee report with which the public may not be fully aware.”
Hammill helpfully provided public links and we provide them here.
Here’s the 1280 pages of the Ethics Committee report .
In a thumbnail, Congress accepted the committee report, which found that Gingrich used tax exempt contributions for political purposes and then attempted to mislead the Ethics Committee about it. Pelosi sat on the Ethics Committee at the time, so has vivid knowledge of the whole business.
Gingrich was fined $300,000 and reprimanded twice, becoming the only House Speaker in history to be reprimanded by the House.
