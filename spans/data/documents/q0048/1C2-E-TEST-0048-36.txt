Back in July 2006, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (CA) appeared at a gas station in Washington, D.C., to draw attention to the high price of gas under President George W. Bush. Back then, gas at that station was $3.19 per gallon, yet today gas prices in the very same location are a whopping $4.45 per gallon — yet Pelosi is nowhere to be found. But Pelosi isn’t the only one missing. Back in 2006, she stood alongside Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Representatives Rahm Emanuel (D-IL) and Ed Markey (D-MA), all of … More

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is knee-deep in allegations that she used her influence to personally enrich herself and her family since becoming speaker of the House in 2007. Scribe reported last week that Pelosi stands to benefit financially from major energy legislation called the NAT GAS Act. Pelosi, who once promised to lead “the most honest, most open, most ethical Congress in history,” has engaged in some ethically questionable decisions since making that pledge. The latest revelation: Pelosi promoted as an economic “expert” suited to guide congressional policy … More

Citizens across America will have a powerful tool to hold their elected leaders accountable come January. The House of Representatives today adopted new standards that increase transparency and improve access to legislative data. All of the information will be publicly available in a searchable format on one website. “With the adoption of these standards, for the first time, all House bills, resolutions and legislative documents will be available in XML in one centralized location,” said House Administration Chairman Dan Lungren (R-CA). “Providing easy access to legislative information increases constituent feedback and ultimately … More

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has pushed for a piece of legislation that would directly enrich her financially. Pelosi owns a major stake in a company that would likely see its share prices rise significantly if the legislation is passed. The bill is called the New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions, or “NAT GAS,” Act, and Congress is rushing to consider it before adjourning for the year. The legislation would subsidize vehicles powered by natural gas and the refueling infrastructure needed to make those vehicles feasible. Energy tycoon … More

Two years ago, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–CA) shocked many Americans by dismissing a question about Obamacare’s constitutionality with the flippant retort: “Are you serious? Are you serious?” So much for the oath she swore to “support and defend” the Constitution. By comparison, the current Speaker of House, John Boehner (R–OH) demonstrates that he takes his oath far more seriously. Raising concerns about Obama’s recent decision to bypass Congress and unilaterally change student loan and mortgage policy, Speaker Boehner pledged that the House will keep “a very close eye on … More

“Are you serious? Are you serious?” then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D–CA) famously replied when asked where, specifically, the Constitution granted Congress the authority to mandate that every American purchase health insurance coverage. The question was very serious, it turns out, even if Pelosi’s intent was sarcasm. Four federal courts have already struck down Obamacare in whole or in part on constitutional grounds. And now, with the Supreme Court widely expected to take the case in the coming weeks, three of the individuals who proved Pelosi wrong will address … More

In an interview late last week, House Minority Leaeder Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told CNBC that Boeing should either unionize its production facilities in South Carolina, or shut them down entirely. “Do you think it’s right that Boeing has to close down that plant in South Carolina because it’s non union?” asked host Maria Bartiromo. Pelosi’s reply: “Yes.” The minority leader quickly added that she would rather it simply unionize and stay open. But barring unionization, by Pelosi’s reasoning, it should simply shut down. Boeing is the target of a suit … More

Last week, the state of Wisconsin released a report summarizing the effects of Obamacare on the Badger State’s health care system. The study, which was conducted by Gorman Actuarial and MIT Economist Jonathan Gruber—an Obamacare supporter—and commissioned by former Governor Jim Doyle (D), provides further proof that Obamacare is on track to break the promises President Obama made to the American people regarding his plan for health care reform: “It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance for those who don’t.” … More

Wondering how all those businesses in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s district ended up with Obamacare waivers? The story drew national attention last month, but there’s still little known about the process used by the Obama administration to grant the controversial waivers. That’s prompted more than 30 members of Congress to write Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius seeking “transparency, fairness, and due process” for the department’s waiver decisions. Heritage’s Ed Haislmaier testified in March that “HHS has exceeded its statutory authority in creating this waiver process.” In fact, … More

If you knew a dangerous virus was about to hit America and that you could beg the government for a vaccine, you’d probably do it, wouldn’t you? That’s just what states and businesses alike are doing right now in preparation for Obamacare. But rather than seeking a vaccine, they’re asking for waivers from the law’s onerous requirements. To date, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has approved 1,372 Obamacare waivers, covering 3.1 million Americans. Yesterday, The Daily Caller reported that among HHS’s most recent round of 204 Obamacare … More
