This is so jacked up! Mario Balotelli , one of the greatest stars in Italian soccer is really being tried in the European championship matches this year.
Soccer Star Faced With Racism In European Championship Matches
UEFA is looking into reports that a banana was thrown by Croatia fans toward the pitch during a European Championship match against Italy.
UEFA said Friday it is seeking more information about the incident, which reportedly happened Thursday in Poznan, Poland.
European football’s ruling body said it had not opened a disciplinary case against the Croatia football association. Italian officials had also not formally complained, UEFA said.
Both Italy matches at Euro 2012 have now been the subject of alleged racist abuse by its opponent’s fans.
UEFA is currently investigating claims by a Spanish fans’ group that some Spain followers made monkey chants at Italy forward Mario Balotelli, who is black, during a Group C match last Sunday in Gdansk.
Balotelli started for Italy against Croatia, and was replaced in the second half.
Ahead of the tournament, Balotelli said in an interview that he would want to “kill” anyone who threw a banana at him. He also threatened to walk off the pitch if he was racially abused.
This is crazy, but do you think Balotelli provoked the attack with his press conference comments?
