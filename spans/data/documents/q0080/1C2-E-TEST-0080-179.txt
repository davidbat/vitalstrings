Former Chelsea player Gianfranco Zola says he would “be dead” if he got up to some of the antics of compatriot Mario Balotelli.
But he says the Manchester City striker can be the star of Euro 2012 – if he manages to control himself.
Zola, who briefly coached Balotelli during his time with Italy under 21s, says temperament is the only thing stopping Balotelli being one of the best players in the world.
Asked by OTP what Balotelli was like to work with, Zola said: “Hard sometimes. Mario can be very hard or he can be very easy.
“For me, Mario can be at the top level and when I say top I really mean top, top, top. But at the same time, he really needs to understand that the person goes with the player.
“The way you can handle your temperament determines or influences the value of you as a player. Mario can be the man of the tournament in the Euro Championships – it’s all down to him.
“I can’t control him, you can’t control him. Only he can.”
Zola claims he never found himself tempted to let off fireworks in the bathroom during his playing days.
He said: “You can’t compare my personality to his personality – it doesn’t work that way. But, no I never did something like that because I would be dead!”
