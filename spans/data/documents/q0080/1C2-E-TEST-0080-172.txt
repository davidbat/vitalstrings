Mario Balotelli is a highly talented striker currently playing for English Premier League club Manchester City under Italian manager Roberto Mancini.
Balotelli is just 20 years old and is a very strong, tall, technicaly gifted Italian footballer. He has a reputation for being very highly strung, and has already had some high profile fallouts with staff and players, most notable of all being his spat with former Inter Milan manager Jose Mourinho. Balotelli has been accused of being lazy during training and not putting in the required effort.
When at Inter Milan he had a decent goalscoring record, scoring just over once every three games. So far he has scored twice for Manchester City in just a hanndful of appearances. Man City currently have a very big squad and so Balotelli will have to be patient while waiting for his opportunity to play.
Mario Balotelli has also been the subject of abuse by many Italian football fans, and has been racially abused by Juventus fans on several occasions. Balotelli is of Ghanian descent but was born in Italy and has played for the Italian national team on a couple of occasions, one of the first black Italian footballers.
Balotelli is definitely a hugely gifted technical footballer, with good pace, strength and ability, but there remains a huge doubt over the players workrate and mindset.
