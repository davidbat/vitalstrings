This Mario guy gets around.
Strip clubs, hookers, call girls and etc.  Only thing missing is him dating a Kardashian.
Mario Balotelli’s agent forestalled a tabloid scandal by confirming reports the Italian had a “brief involvement” with a prostitute previously linked with Wayne Rooney.
The lady in question who purportedly put on her red light is Jenny Thompson , who claimed “Tabloid Wayne” paid her $1,900 per encounter while his wife was pregnant. The scandal broke just before the 2010 World Cup.
‘Recently, I admit, I have been troubled – because of this story, but not only. My natural parents in some interviews have been disrespectful to my family.
‘Now that this weight has been lifted, I am certain that I will find the positive energy to make the best run for the title with Manchester City, and prepare in the best way for the European Championship.’
