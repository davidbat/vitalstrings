MARIO BALOTELLI has admitted he has spoken to contacts at both AC Milan and Inter as he plots his Manchester City exit.
And the madcap Italian striker has also confessed to being tempted by other clubs in England, Italy and Spain.
Balotelli has combined 11 goals with a series of colourful off-field episodes this season.
The 21-year-old said: “Inter’s president Massimo Moratti said he would take me back in an instant.
“I thank him, but I don’t want to leave Manchester City right now. I am not thinking about returning to Italy for the time being, even though I have already spoken with AC Milan and Inter.
“As for Napoli, I like the city of Naples. But there are other teams in Spain and in England that attract me.”
