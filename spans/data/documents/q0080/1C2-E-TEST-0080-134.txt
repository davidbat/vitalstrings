Just days after being named as one of the Britain's Best-dressed Men by GQ magazine, Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli takes the street of Manchester with his model girlfriend Raffaella Fico. The couple both dress in a taste of Italian couture on a cold northern afternoon after enjoying a hearty lunch at San Carlo Italian restaurant.
According to men's style bible GQ, the controversial Manchester City player is the second best dressed man in Britain. Mario Balotelli is in deed used to making a big impression on and off the pitch; and now he is runner-up to rapper Tinie Tempah in style bible GQ magazine’s annual poll despite famously arriving for a match wearing a 'chicken hat' and another time in a training bib.
