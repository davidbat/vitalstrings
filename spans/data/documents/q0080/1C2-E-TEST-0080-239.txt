Mario Balotelli ’s extraordinary talent seems to have spent less time on the field of English football than his difficult personality has in their tabloid papers. And it’s not just football controversy that is plaguing the Italian player , but his other extra-curricular activities which have even gotten fellow Italian and Manchester City coach, Roberto Mancini , offside.
So when he can, Mario Balotelli escapes to Milan, where he was recently spotted with former Miss Italy contestant, Sara Galimerti. The two apparently “met” on Facebook and then spent a night dining and dancing together. Galimerti participated in the 2009 Miss Italy contest as Miss Lombardy and follows hot on the heels of another Sara: the now famous Sara Tommasi - Balotelli’s “ex-girlfriend” and current Italian showgirl .
