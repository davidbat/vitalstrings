Manchester City forward Mario Balotelli faces a four-match suspension by FA after clashing with the midfielder Scott Parker in the 3-2 victory against Tottenham Hotspurs at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday evening.
The Italian striker has been charged for four-game ban with violent conduct for appearing to stomp on an opponent’s head (right ear). The ban might see the striker to miss the Carling Cup semi-final second leg at Anfield stadium, along with English Premier League matches over Everton, Aston Villa and Fulham.
Balotelli might appeal the verdict, but could also see the suspension comprehensive if the English Football Association panel thinks it a frivolous move. The FA has now given Balotelli until 6 p.m. on Wednesday to respond to the charge.
Manchester City forward player had already received a yellow card, escaped without any permit from referee Howard Webb. He went on to receive a penalty kick and converted it in second-half injury time to give City a 3-2 victory.
Balotelli has also received hold from City midfielder James Milner, who believes the 21-year-old’s tricks can take the pressure off the rest of the squad. Also strike partner Aguero admiring the Italian for his qualities as a player, Aguero gushed Balotelli is a lovely lad – who just happens to have a strange personality.
