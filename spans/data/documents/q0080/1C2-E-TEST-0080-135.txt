The AMAZING Mario Balotelli helps kid who is being bullied
Please don’t ever leave…
God, The Spoiler loves Mario Balotelli. In under a season in English football we already have enough to come up with a list of about 20 ridiculous things he’s done, from the good (giving cash to a homeless guy) to the bad (throwing darts at people).
This latest thing might be the best though. According to The Sun, after seeing a young lad skiving off school with his mum at Man City’s Carrington training ground, the Italian demanded to know why he wasn’t in school.
When the boy admitted he was being bullied, Balotelli took things into his own gorgeous hands…
He got the boy and his mum and drove them to the school in his Maserati where he demanded a meeting with the headmaster. He got the boy to confess what was happening and identify the boy who was bullying him.
The youngsters then apparently shook hands before Balo got back into his car and drove off into the sunset.
A ‘source’ said:
“Mario feels strongly about bullying and thinks it’s out of order. He had no qualms about sorting the mess out as he felt the lad should not be missing out on school.”
The Spoiler is choosing to believe this story 100 per cent and not question any aspect of it. HOWEVER, there aren’t (m)any facts about the boy, the mother or the school which does raise a quizzical eyebrow.
The Sun also appeals for the mother to come forward at the end of the piece which suggests they have yet to verify much of this.
And, finally, what The Spoiler knows about cars can be written on the back of a postage stamp by a small child with a crayon, but aren’t Maserati’s two-seater cars? Aren’t they? Or not? We’re just speculating…
Anyway, regardless of things like ‘facts’ or ‘details’ we definitely believe this story and will repeat it to anyone who’ll listen for years to come. Well done, Mario!
