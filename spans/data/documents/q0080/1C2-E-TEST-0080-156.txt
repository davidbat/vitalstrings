Everybody already knows Mario Balotelli is a theatrical player . His crazy antics have led others to vilify him despite his incredible talent. After Sunday's 3-2 victory over Tottenham, the debate has shifted to whether or not the mohawked 21-year-old is not only an immature player, but a dirty player as well.
In the 84th minute of play with the score tied 2-2, Balotelli lost his balance and stepped on Scott Parker's head. If it was on purpose, he should have been sent off immediately. The ref didn't see it, and Balotelli went on to score the game-winning penalty goal in stoppage time. With clear video of the stomp, Balotelli is facing a potential four-game ban.
