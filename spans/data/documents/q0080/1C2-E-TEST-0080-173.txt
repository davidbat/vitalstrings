Raffaella Fico’s Mario Balotelli linked to Holly Henderson
By WFE Writer | November 2, 2011 | Comment
Mario Balotelli’s relationship with Raffaella Fico is in danger as he has been linked to glamour model Holly Henderson.
Raffaella Fico may be saying goodbye to Mario Balotelli soon.
Last week, Balotelli was pictured watching inside an adult magazine in a newsagents while his girlfriend Raffaella Fico was just at his side.
There is no evidence that the magazine he was looking at was connected to adult movie actress Henderson, though.
In any case, there are now rumours indicating that he had a secret date with Holly, whereas Raffaella Fico was away in Italy for a modelling task.
Speaking of Balotelli’s attraction for the 32-year-old star, a source told The Sun: “He is having the time of his life at the moment.
“He first met Holly in a club and has become infatuated with her.
“He has done all the running but she doesn’t want to just be a notch on a footballer’s bedpost.”
The 21-year-old Manchester City striker was seen with Holly Henderson at the Marriott Hotel and Country Club, as the model was on duty.
After showing up uninvited, Balotelli signed a few autographs and then had a cigarette with his “new friend” in the car park.
How bad will the consequences be when Raffaella Fico reacts to all the buzzes that have been degrading her lately?
