Mario Balotelli Tried a Backheel And Missed a Wide Open Goal. His Coach Wasn't Impressed. Here is the Mario Balotelli Backheel Video
Mario Balotelli is at it again. The controversial Man City striker earned the ire of coaches and fans everywhere during a friendly match in the US on July 24, 2011. During the Man City vs LA Galaxy friendly, Mario Balotelli got a little too fancy with the ball. Actually, he got a lot too fancy with the ball, trying a fancy backheel in front of an open net. Of course, Balotelli failed to score on the play and was promptly pulled from the game.
In the 32nd minute of the Man City-Galaxy game, Balotelli beat his defenders and seemed to have an easy goal. Rather than tapping the ball in the net, Balotelli tried a fancy backheel shot that missed the net. TeammatÂ  Edin Dzeko raised his arms in disbelief at the Mario Balotelli backheel.
Coach Mancini pulled the 20-year-old striker from the game almost immediately.
This isn't the first that Mario Balotelli has been the butt of jokes. A few months back, cameras caught Balotelli having a hard time putting on a training bib .
