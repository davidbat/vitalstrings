Manchester City have confirmed that Mario Balotelli was involved in a car crash today in Manchester’s city center. Although a passenger was taken to a local hospital as a precaution, it appears the biggest injuries were to the cars, including Balotelli’s $220,000 Bentley. The Manchester Evening News showed a piece of the car resting serenely at road side .
The club also confirmed that Balotelli was not at fault (hadn’t occurred to me to care about that yet). I suppose we’re to infer that trouble is now finding him?
That may have happened with this one. According to a witness, a Vauxhall Corsa was making a quick U-turn, there was a bang, and after the Bentley came to a stop, it’s driver side window descended to reveal Balotelli’s demands: “get that man to me.”
The best part? The aftermath:
“Mario was on the phone and a short time later a Range Rover turned up with a couple of Italian-looking blokes inside who looked like they knew him.”
They weren’t just guys. They were “Italian-looking blokes.” Beautiful.
The party presumably drove off making Snatch-esque plans of how to avenge Mario’s fallen Bentley.
Also, I’m buying his kit.
