Mario Balotelli's Girlfriend, Melissa Castagnoli, Has Moved to Manchester to Be With the Football Star
According to the UK's Daily Star , the couple are now hoping that their days of being targeted for their race are long behind them. The Star reports that Balotelli suffered years of racist abuse from Italian fans who did not like his skin color, or the fact that he dated white women.

Melissa Castagnoli has been attacked in the past on an unrelated issue, when a girl was reportedly jealous of her looks and beat her up. She was also a Miss Italy finalist and has been featured as a WAG of the week by football.co.uk. 
Other girlfriends of Balotelli have suffered some abuse in the past, but he now hopes his move to Manchester City will put all that behind him.
A friend said: “The racism Mario suffered in Italy was horrendous, really, really  horrendous. And his girlfriends always got picked on for dating a black man.
“The UK doesn’t seem to have the same prejudices as some people do in Italy and Mario really hopes it will all end now.”

Balotelli's parents are Ghanian, but he was born in Italy.
Juventus supporters used to chant “a ­negro cannot be Italian” while Roma fans threw bananas at him.

Balotelli has said that he has tried to deal with the issue in the past, but sometimes it was just really hurtful. Manchester City fans seem to be welcoming however.
Matty Lord, 37, said: “Thankfully in this country we don’t care about the colour of anyone’s skin.
“Mario won’t get any abuse from fans here. He is supremely  talented and will no doubt become a real hero.”
