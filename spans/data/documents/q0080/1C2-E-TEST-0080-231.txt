The more we catch Mario Balotelli in plain clothes , the less we like him. And although we like to pretend he’s aware of this fact, it didn’t stop his inner fashion criminal from doing some dressed-down damage to the streets of Milan on Monday with his girlfriend.
In other words, ‘Super Mario’ has a lot to learn about being a rich and famous ‘baller. The only reason Cristiano Ronaldo would’ve done such a thing is if his well-suited bum was firmly planted front row at Milan Fashion Week (occurring now). Definitely not because he had an urge to spend his money unwisely on things that he didn’t need and don’t last that long.
Then again, why spend money on a therapist when he’s already using his wardrobe to work out his issues?
