Mario Balotelli is a divine talent, of that there is no doubt. He has a big problem though, and that is his attitude. He is lazy, petulant and childish. So I’m asking, what exactly is wrong with him? In this article, I will dissect the enigma that is Mario Barwuah Balotelli and try and discover what is the cause of his bad behaviour.
First of all, there is the fact that he is black. Now, I have nothing wrong with it, but there's a real problem with racism in Italian football, and he copped a ton of racial abuse in his time at the peninsula. When someone so young is subjected to so much abuse, things can get pretty tough. Perhaps this torment contributes to his bad character.
Next, there is his arrogance. Mario thinks he is God’s gift to mankind. Upon receiving the Golden Boy award, he stated that he “did not know” who Jack Wilshere was and that of all the youngsters that had won the award only Lionel Messi was a “little better” than him. From this arrogance sprouts laziness. Balotelli believes he is so good he does not even have to try and he will score. No fans in the world will respect and warm to a lazy footballer no matter how freakishly talented they are. Maybe this contributes to his poor behaviour.
Also, there is the issue of his upbringing. He has said before like he loves his adopted family, but hates his biological parents for ditching him. Hating your natural parents would be very tough on a child and is never good. As a child, Balotelli forced his adoptive mother to hold his hand in bed until he fell asleep out of fear. This fear could have definitely arose from not having his real parents and being uncertain of who he is and where he is from. This hate of his African parents has surely had an effect on Super Mario.
Can Mario Balotelli Be Changed?
Yes
