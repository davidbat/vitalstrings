Nike Grooms Mario Balotelli in New Ad
This dynamic striker's rep just grew by leaps and bounds.
Already a major up and comer, playing for Manchester City and the Italian National team, Mario Balotelli is gifted with charisma and Soccer talent.
He's one of the reasons Manchester City was able to steal the crown away from Manchester United this year.  Balotelli helps put Man City on more of a pedestal and distinguishes them from other clubs.  
His image is enhanced tremendously with the Nike spot because it is so appealing and funny to watch.
He's a guy to root for in the future.  And, maybe someday, like in a decade, he'll be coming stateside to MLS.
