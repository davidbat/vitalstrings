A Good Euro 2012 Campaign is Vital
You just can’t keep him out of the headlines. Just over a week before Italy kick off their Euro 2012 campaign against Spain, Mario Balotelli threatened to “kill” anyone who should dare to throw a banana at him during the tournament.
For once though, the 21-year-old striker is not at the centre of attention; Italian football faces a fresh match-fixing scandal that has led Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, to suggest that the domestic game be suspended for up to three years in order to get over yet more reputation-smearing allegations. Still, Italy can take solace in the fact that the last two times the country’s domestic game was mired in scandal, the national team went on to win World Cups.
However, Italy’s latest dismal showing against Russia last week was the Azzurri’s third defeat in a row, and the third game in which they failed to score. We can’t take friendly results at face value, but the situation does not bode well for Prandelli’s men.
On a personal level, the fact that attention has been deflected from Balotelli himself may prove to be a blessing in disguise for the hot-headed striker. A good tournament is vital to raise his stock at club level.
The re-emergence of Carlos Tevez and the fact that Manchester City will no doubt spend big again this summer will leave the Italian down the pecking order. It is unlikely that City will currently be able to recoup the £24 million they paid for him just under two years ago, as although he shows flashes of brilliance, the temperamental Balotelli is a liability. A strong campaign this summer may convince Roberto Mancini to give him one more chance, or another team to match City’s valuation of him. A weak one could leave him in footballing limbo.
