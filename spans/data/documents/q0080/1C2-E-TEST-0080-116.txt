This goal by Mario Balotelli in the end of the game truly a masterpiece, he can still balance out himself despite being fouled and smashed the goal to the back of the net.
Even though Cassano had made it 1-0, Balotelli’s goal settled it for Italy 2-0 Republic of Ireland

After scoring that goal, Balotelli tried to say something but Bonucci quickly covered his mouth and censored whatever coming out from his foul mouth.
