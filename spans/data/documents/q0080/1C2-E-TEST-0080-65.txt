Manchester City coach Roberto Mancini has dismissed rumors he in talks with AC Milan over strikers Mario Balotelli and Carlos Tevez.
Mancini met with Milan Vice President Adriano Galliani at the Italian club's headquarters on Monday, but the former Inter Milan coach said it was simply a courtesy visit.
In an interview with Italian news agency ANSA on Tuesday, Mancini says that Galliani had asked to see him and added: ''It lasted 10 minutes and I certainly didn't make an offer for Thiago Silva. Even less did I offer Balotelli or Tevez to Milan.''
Milan has long been linked with Tevez and a deal for the Argentine fell through in the winter transfer market during the controversial striker's long-running feud with City.
Balotelli played for Inter Milan for three years.
