Mario Balotelli’s fabulous T-shirt asking ‘Why Always Me?’ is now on sale for £11.90 and is set to come to a shop near you!
Balotelli curled in the opening goal in Manchester City’s earth-shaking 6-1 demolition job against city rivals Manchester United (Click Link) at Old Trafford.
The Italian striker then stood still in Eric Cantona-like fashion, looked dead straight before brandishing a powerful, yet humorous message asking the on-watching millions – ‘why always me?’.
The words, or message, is a satirical, if not serious question aimed at those who ‘Super Mario’ believes have it in for him in the wake of mounting back page headlines.
It was a classical moment in what will come to be regarded as one of the greatest ever Manchester derby performances and once again, in his own idiosyncratic way, Balotelli took centre stage.
The ‘Why Always Me?’ T-Shirts come in all sizes with a standard cut T-shape and are 100% cotton. They are especially suitable for moody teens or young adults who feel they are always picked upon by misunderstanding seniors.
