Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini thinks Mario Balotelli is capable of anything after dismissing the latest story about the striker.
There was a rumour circulating that claimed Balotelli was dressed as Santa Claus and was handing out money into passers-by in Manchester.
The Citizens boss denied this as all of his Manchester City side were in the team hotel before the game with Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium – but he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it was Balotelli.
“I don't know - with Mario it is possible! We should ask him. It could be, I don't know,” joked Mancini.
“But he was in the hotel and it was forbidden to bring fireworks!”
The fiery Italy international has been the subject of a number of bizarre rumours since he came to England.
One of which has Balotelli driving a truanting autograph hunter at the training ground back to school to confront the bullies who had made the boy afraid of going to school.
The mention of fireworks from Mancini refers to and incident where the former Inter striker set his house ablaze after letting off fireworks in his bathroom.
It looks as though this latest rumour is unfounded, as Balotelli was with the rest of the squad preparing for the Barclays Premier League fixture against Arsenal.
The Citizens were 1-0 winners in that game and Balotelli was instrumental in the win, as it was his shot that was parried by Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny before David Silva bundled in the winner.
The next fixture for Balotelli and City is a home tie against Stoke City on Wednesday at the Etihad Stadium.
