Balotelli evokes grim memories
Balotelli said he had bananas thrown at him in a Rome bar before the European Under-21 Championships in June 2009 and if it happened again, "I will go to jail, because I will kill them," The Guardian reported Wednesday.
The 21-year-old also said he would walk off the field if he received racial abuse during a game.
"I will not accept racism at all. It's unacceptable," he said.
His comments came after former England international Sol Campbell urged fans not to go to Euro 2012 because "you could end up coming back in a coffin," due to the threat of racism and violence.
It is feared that neo-Nazi gangs in the host nations are planning to target black players and fans.
"Stay at home, watch it on TV. Don't risk it," Campbell said.
Meanwhile, in an interview with France Football, Balotelli described himself as a genius.
Balotelli has frequently made headlines since joining City from Inter Milan two years ago, and he is never far from controversy.
The striker, however, claimed he is "a genius, but not a rebel."
"I have my life, my world, I do what I want, without annoying anyone. I believe I am more intelligent than the average person," he said.
