READ DESCRIPTION:
This is my Balotelli video with all his goals for Machester City this season. In addition I have got some of his skills/tricks,
funny moments as well as some controversial stuff that he has done.
I believe that this video perfectly demonstrates how this season has been
for the young Italian. There are not many people who like him nor rate him, but I do - I believe that he can become a 'great' player if he is serious.
The name of the song:
Altamira - The Next Nutcracker (Remix 2009 Hip Hop)
