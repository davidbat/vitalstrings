Mario Balotelli has been in another incident once again after his new £100K Maserati was allegedly confiscated d by police on the M60 near Worsley, Salford only a day after purchasing it.
Police stopped the 21-year-old football star after they suspected he was speeding. His Maserati was immediately seized as they questioned if the car was legally registered. However the car was soon handed back to the Man City football star, as for once he did something right and showed them that his papers were in order.
Oh Mario! Why Always You?
