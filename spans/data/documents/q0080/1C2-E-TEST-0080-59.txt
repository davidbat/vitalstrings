You hit the nail on the head: he’s a bored young adult. And calling him an adult is a stretch. His skill on the pitch is what I’d call world class potential, however his antics off the pitch are nothing short of children’s tomfoolery. I enjoy watching him play, but his arrogance is just so unappealing. Dude needs a serious attitude adjustment. I’m interested to see just how Mancini handles him, considering he seems to be doing well with the whole Tevez blowup.

It is a non-story to me. Is it against the law to light up fireworks?

well, the fire brigade was called at 1am… so yes it was illegal.
the latest you can set off fireworks is 11pm or midnight of bonfire night.
you don’t wanna know why I know this…
