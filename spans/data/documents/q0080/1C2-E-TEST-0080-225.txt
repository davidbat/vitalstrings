We’ll let you off with this one, Mario
After yesterday’s cry for help to Ronaldo , Mario Balotelli is back to true form in today’s newspapers.
The Manchester City star is alleged to have launched into chants of “Rooney, Rooney” after he spotted the prostitute at the centre of the Wayne Rooney scandal across a crowded restaurant.
The 20-year-old saw hooker Jenny Thompson at the San Carlo Italian restaurant, where he dines every evening. He is said to have begun chanting Rooney’s name as she returned to her table from the toilets.
The Sun alleges Balotelli then “burst out laughing and flicked the finger at Jenny’s friends”. The young Italian is then said to have picked a fight with Thompson’s friend Sam Birch by blowing a raspberry in his face and inviting him to step outside.
Birch said: “He said ‘Come with me’ and walked outside. He tried to grab my arm before squaring up.
“Our foreheads were touching and I wasn’t going to back down. Then he swore at me in Italian and the waiters ran over and took me inside.”
Balotelli left in his white Maserati shortly after the incident, while the restaurant has since barred Thompson.
Birch added: “He was acting crazy. I think he is unhinged.”
We’re inclined to agree – but it’s great for OTP material!

I think it’s a case of very simple economics: the guy eats his dinner there EVERY NIGHT! The management definitely know what side their bread’s buttered!
