We continue our coverage of international Mario Balotelli week with this video he did the other day. Dealing with a recently burnt-out house a media glare that would make a Presidential candidate sweat, a average man might have been forgiven for wanting to lay low. Mario Balotelli is not an average man.
No, Mario instead took to answering questions on the internet, with the official City twitter feed asking fans to send in their queries for the mercurial striker. And funnily enough, it made us sympathize with Mario. He comes off not like an arrogant, self-centered sociopath, but instead seems like a nice kid whose biggest crime is being a little naive and getting in over his head.
In fact, Mario seems like less of a Carlos Tevez-style renegade, and more like what happens when you give a ten year old a million dollars and tell him he can do whatever he wants with no consequences.
