Start with No.10
It's been quite a week for the most talked about man in football. Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli has gone almost setting his house alight with fireworks, to downing United in the derby and coining the phrase "why always me".

He’s explosive, unpredictable, hard to contain and very, very direct...and that's just when 'Super' Mario Balotelli opens his mouth.
Balotelli is fast becoming the most quotable man in football and regardless of whether the £24 million Italian striker delivers on the pitch for his new club, at this moment in time, he clearly represents the best entertainment value off of it.
