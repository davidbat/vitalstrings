If you ani’t up on Balotelli, you are missing out. Even if you don’t follow soccer, you can appreciate the stories. Like, A-RodThere’s always some ridiculous story about him, but unlike A-Rod, they’re awesome stories, and rarely have to do with him kissing himself in the mirror or being fed popcorn.

I mean how can you not have remorse in a situation like this. A 25 year old who is in peak physical condition, better then 99.9% of the world, just collapses and dies outta nowhere. This shows nothing of Balotelli he is still ignorant muhhfucka. Balo should scratch the YOLO undershirt for the next game they let him play in after trying to break like 4 Arsenal players legs…Dudes a bum sorry

They let him off clean after he hit Song too. I don’t see how that makes any sense.

Balotelli’s antics supercede his ability.  Now that Tevez is back, the combo with Aguero and Dzeko will suffice for City even if they’re probably going to fall short points-wise against United.

If Balo ever got his shit together City could have the best front line in the BPL, maybe even all of club football.

Unlike a comment mentioned above, I think it is awesome you guys cover subjects like this, especially soccer.
