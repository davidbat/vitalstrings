ITALY coach Cesare Prandelli will ask Mario Balotelli if his outburst after scoring against Ireland was directed at him.
The 21-year-old didn’t start the 2-0 win over the Irish on Monday, which saw Italy make the quarter-finals, but the Manchester City forward came off the bench and scored his first goal in the tournament. Rather than celebrate, he looked at the Italian bench and shouted a few words before team-mate Leonardo Bonucci put his hand over the striker’s mouth.
“I don’t know if Balotelli was upset with me, I will ask him,” Prandelli said. “But from Bonucci’s gesture you can see the team spirit in the group.
“Why didn’t he celebrate the goal? Perhaps he is not able to express the joy he feels inside. He is like that but that doesn’t mean he is detached from the group.”
Prandelli was pleased with Balotelli’s performance but says he is still growing up as a player.
“When he entered the pitch he did what we asked him to do,” Prandelli said.
“In order to take that leap and become a champion, Balotelli has to go through this moments. He has to accept criticism, being on the bench and for the team to demand more from him.”
