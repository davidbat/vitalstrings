2011 Funny Mario Balotelli Why Always Me Man City T-Shirt
Mario Balotelli has done it again. This time it’s scoring an exquisite goal in the Manchester derby, and then lifting his Manchester City shirt to reveal a T-shirt underneath which said, simply, “Why Always Me?”
Hats off to a brilliant cross by James Milner, and the cool, calm and collected finish by Balotelli. The man is nonchalance personified. How composed he was on the ball when he slotted it into the back of the net.
In a sport that lacks humor, it’s a breath of fresh air to see someone like Balotelli being a character again and showing a lighter side of the game.
Perfect for winding up United fans after their 1-6 thrashing whether you support City or not!
For United fans we have the perfect response to Balotelli's t-shirt, the Man Utd 'Why Always Us' t-shirt .
And for fans of teams who have never achieved anything the 'Why Never Us' T-Shirt
Price: £11.99
