Couldnt agree more with Rollo; this guy is the definition of asshole. You just scored an awesome goal, how bout a smile,
I think it was more just not knowing the details of the situation from TBL (ignorance?) more than sarcasm. It’s interesting to watch the rest of the team try to get him to stop inciting the away team’s fans the whole time they ushered him back after the goal. And he wonders why fans in Italy used to throw bananas at him (probably for other reasons, but still…)
