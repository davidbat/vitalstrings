Mario Balotelli ate pasta and meatballs in Maidenhead cafe
A cafe owner has spoken about Mario Balotelli's visit to Maidenhead yesterday.
Salvatore Palmieri, of Palmieri's in Furze Platt Road, told the Advertiser the Manchester City striker and his brother spent about an hour in the cafe during the afternoon.
He said the Italian footballer, who tucked into pasta and meatballs, was 'easy going' and 'a good laugh'.
The father-of-two from Gloucester Road runs the cafe, which serves homemade Italian food, with his brother Roberto and wife Teresa.
He said they had just closed the kitchen for the afternoon but reopened it for their visitor.
They let Balotelli eat his food quietly before they chatted to him and afterwards the 21-year-old signed a football for them.
Mr Palmieri said he thought stories of Balotelli's behaviour off the field might be slightly over exaggerated.
