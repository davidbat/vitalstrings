Why Always Me?! Mario Balotelli gatecrashes Andrea Stramaccioni’s 1st press conference as Inter Milan manager
Tuesday, March 27th, 2012
It was supposed to be the moment that Andrea Stramaccioni reassured Inter Milan fans that he was the right man to replace the sacked Claudio Ranieri. Instead it became yet another infamous moment in the career of Mario Balotelli.
Crazy scenes played out in Italy on Tuesday as former Nerazzurri striker, and now Manchester City tearaway, Mario Balotelli interrupted Andrea Stramaccioni’s first press conference as Inter manager.
With Stramaccioni caught in mid-sentence, Balotelli gatecrashed the presser by bowling in from a side entrance before he shook hands with Stramaccioni and the other Inter directors on stage.
Naturally, Balotelli’s behaviour provoked laughter from the journalists in the audience.
