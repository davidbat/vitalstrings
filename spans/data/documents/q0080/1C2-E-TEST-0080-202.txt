Guess what Mario Balotelli just did?

Pull up a chair and feast your eyes on this story of a soft dull fool – Mario Balotelli. For those of you that don’t know Mario is a footballer and earns enough money to afford all the luxuries befitting dumb idiots and wacky gentlemen.
Yes, in the early hours of Saturday morning Manchester City’s Mario Balotelli took to his bathroom and got sexy with a firework. He stuck it up his b-hole and then lit it.
As the sparkling flames shot out of his bottom it set off a box of factory-defect sparklers, jumping jacks and catherine wheels and the sorry episode descended into chaos.
The fire brigade were not amused as Mario’s fire in the hole not only singed his butt hairs off it also set his whole house on fire.
I guess the art of having a firework orgasm through bum sex just isn’t as appealing as it used to be.
