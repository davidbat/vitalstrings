Mario Balotelli LA Galaxy Backheel Video Mancini Substitution Touchline Row 2011 Man City
By Soccer Blog | Jul 25, 2011
This Mario Balotelli LA Galaxy backheel video happened during Man City’s pre-season friendly against Los Angeles Galaxy in the World Football Challenge 2011 on July 24, 2011. Man City beat LA Galaxy 7-6 on penalties, but that result was overshadowed by this little Balotelli LA Galaxy backheel incident.
Balotelli, as we know, can be a temperamental bloke at times ( remember his fight with Rio Ferdinand?), and he cheekily tried to backheel this ball into the net, but failed. It invited the wrath of Man City boss Roberto Mancini, who did not approve of Balotelli’s backheel show and promptly substituted him. Balotelli then had a war of words with Mancini on the touchline before storming off.
