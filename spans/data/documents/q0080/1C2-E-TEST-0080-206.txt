Roberto Mancini suggests that Yaya Toure will need to be better when Manchester City meet Manchester United next week.
City host United in a potentially title-defining clash at Etihad Stadium on Monday night and Mancini has urged Toure to produce a better showing than he did in the 2-0 win at Wolves on Sunday.
The Italian also indicated that right-back Micah Richards will be available following injury whilst bad boy Mario Balotelli may also be in contention following his three-match ban.
"If Yaya Toure is on form, he is a top player," Mancini said. "But we need him to be 100 per cent and on Sunday he was so-so.
"We also need to check on Micah Richards to see how his hamstring is. Providing he has recovered, with Mario Balotelli back from suspension, we will have everyone."
