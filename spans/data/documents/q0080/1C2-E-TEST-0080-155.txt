Is the firing of Claudio Ranieri and the hiring of Andrea Stramaccioni enough to bring 21-year-old Italian phenom Mario Balotelli back to Inter Milan?

The club has stated that Balotelli’s appearance at the presser was unexpected, but when it comes to Mario, many of us have already learned to expect the unexpected.
Here is a look at Balotelli crashing the Inter Milan press conference.
