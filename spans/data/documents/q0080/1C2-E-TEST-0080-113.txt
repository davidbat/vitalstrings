Mario Balotelli's future remains up in the air
The agent of Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli is confident the controversial Italian will remain with the club next season.
Balotelli's future was brought into question following his send-off against Arsenal in City's 1-0 loss at the Emirates on Sunday. Immediately after the Premier League title-denting defeat, manager Roberto Mancini suggested Balotelli would be sold in the summer, but the player's representative believes such predictions may be premature.
"In England, only tabloids write about Balotelli and I use them to clean my car," Mino Raiola told Sky Italia. "People expect always a lot from Mario so everything he does is amplified. Mario wants to do well for Mancini, who is a big friend of Balotelli.
"Mancini says Balotelli will be sold this summer? I don't think so. I will talk to the club and Mancini."
Despite Balotelli becoming involved in a series of dangerous challenges throughout the loss to Arsenal, Raiola insists the striker felt remorse after being shown a second yellow card for sliding in on Alex Song late in the game.
"I spoke with Balotelli and he was very sorry for what happened today," Raiola said. "I didn't see the incident but like Mancini said, things can happen.
"I don't want to discuss the chance that Balotelli can leave the Premier League. If Mario wanted to leave he didn't need to do it like this but simply to ask the club."
Raiola, though, did agree that Balotelli may not play for City again this campaign, with Mancini confirming he does not plan to utilise the services of his compatriot again. Balotelli is facing a three-match ban for his dismissal at the weekend, having already been sent-off earlier this season.
"Mario will receive a big suspension after this red card," Raiola said.
