Maybe Mario Balotelli will think twice next time he gets the ball right in front of the net.
In the 32nd minute of Manchester City's friendly against the Los Angeles Galaxy on Sunday, the striker got past the defenders and had a perfect opportunity to give his team a 2-0 lead.
Instead, Balotelli tried to be fancy and attempted a backheel kick that went wide right of the net. His Manchester City teammate, Edin Dzeko, threw his arms up and looked baffled by Balotelli's miss.
Club manager Roberto Mancini immediately took Balotelli out of the game, even though it was the 20-year-old who put his side up 1-0 with a penalty kick.
Daniel Taylor of The Guardian tweeted that Balotelli stayed in the dressing room during the second half.
"Mario is young, I want to help him and that is the end of it," Mancini said after Manchester City won 7-6 on penalties. "To take him off after 30 minutes is enough punishment. It won't have been easy for him but it has to be a lesson."
