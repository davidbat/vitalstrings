Korea Apartment Twin Towers Design Resembles Exploding WTC – Dutch architectural firm MVRDV was forced to issue an apology for neglecting to realize that their new masterpiece dubbed the Cloud Towers resembled the World Trade Center twin towers minutes after they were hit by terrorists on September 11th, 2001.
The luxury buildings which are set to be built in South Korean capital Seoul are connected by what are called “pixelated cloud” (a series of apartment complex) on the 37th floor which can be confused with the dust particles mix with debris that emerged from the New York skyscrapers after it was struck by the planes.
The firm said in a statement:
“It was not our intention to create an image resembling the attacks nor did we see the resemblance during the design process. We sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings we have hurt, it was not our intention.”
MVRDV’s Jan Knicker admitted that the company did see the comparisons during the design process and added that they have no intention of changing their plans – the Cloud Towers will be constructed in 2015.
The company has been receiving hundreds of hate mails since the pictures surfaced.
