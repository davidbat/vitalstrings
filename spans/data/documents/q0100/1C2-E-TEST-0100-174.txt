I'm sorry, when you used a PROPELLER driven aircraft (starting about 1:36 ) to show your JET vortex theory you basically made the entire video suspect. Also by the time you claim there should have been a vortex the engines would have been stopped if only because of the debris blocking their intakes. At least TRY to make a logical video.
