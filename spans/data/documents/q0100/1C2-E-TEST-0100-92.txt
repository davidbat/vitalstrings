The two blue beams are made up of 88 light bulbs that are 7,000 watts each. Visible for more than 60 miles, the powerful beacons were turned on one at a time after 8pm. The Tribute in Light’s 88 powerful searchlights will project upwards from Ground Zero from dusk on September 11 until dawn on September 12 .
The art installation was switched on for the first time this year on Tuesday evening, as preparations for the tenth anniversary of 9/11 on Sunday started
