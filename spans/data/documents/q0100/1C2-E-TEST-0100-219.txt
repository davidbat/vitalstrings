On occasion, the public has been asked by George W. Bush to refrain from  considering certain conspiracy theories. Bush has made such requests when people  were looking into crimes in which he might be culpable. For example, when in  1994 Bush’s former company Harken Energy was linked to the fraudulent Bank of  Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) through several investors, Bush’s  spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, shut down the inquiry by telling the Associated Press — “We have no response to silly conspiracy theories.” On another occasion, Bush  said in a televised speech — “Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy  theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th.”
But paradoxically, we have also been asked to believe Bush’s own outrageous  conspiracy theory about 9/11, one that has proven to be false in many ways. One  important way to see the false nature of Bush’s conspiracy theory is to note the  fact that the World Trade Center buildings could only have fallen as they did  through the use of explosives. A number of independent scientific studies have  pointed out this fact [1, 2, 3, 4] , but it was  Bush’s own scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), through their inability to provide a convincing defense of the official  line, who ultimately proved that explosives were necessary. [2, 5, 6, 7]
This leads us to ask the obvious question — Who could have placed explosives  in the World Trade Center towers? To answer that question, we should first  consider who had access to the buildings, specifically the areas of the  buildings that would be relevant to a demolition operation. We should also  consider the time periods of interest. Those who had access at the necessary  times should be further considered in terms of their ability to obtain the  necessary explosive technologies and expertise, their ability to be secretive,  and the possibility that they could have benefited from the destruction of the  WTC buildings or from the resulting War on Terror. But one thing is certain,  unless it was done by one person acting alone, it must have been a conspiracy.
The Twin Towers and WTC 7, all highly secure buildings, were most readily  accessed by tenants, security and building management staff, and  construction-related contractors.
Evidence suggests that the period of interest should include the years  between the 1993 WTC bombing and September 11th, 2001. This evidence includes  the warning from 1993 bombing conspirator Nidal Ayyad, who reportedly wrote — “next time it will be more precise.” [8] Additionally, evidence of a multi-year plot included the detailed information  that FBI informant and mafia kingpin Gregory Scarpa Jr. received while in jail,  as early as 1996, from Al-Qaeda operative Ramzi Yousef, while imprisoned in the  adjacent cell. Yousef described plans to “bring New York to its knees” by  blowing up the World Trade Center with American-owned “flying massive bombs.”  Scarpa Jr. provided this information to Assistant US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald  and FBI Counsel Valerie Caproni, who were apparently not interested. [9] Another example is the recorded conversation  between FBI informant Randy Glass and Pakistani ISI agent Raja Gulum Abbas, in  which Abbas claimed “Those towers are coming down”, indicating that a plan was  in progress as of July 1999. [10]
Throughout the life of the WTC buildings, modifications were made to each  structure. The modifications included upgrades to electrical, fire protection,  and elevator systems, as well as general construction activities. As a rule, the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) was responsible for  initiating the modifications in the public access areas, and the tenants were  responsible for completing the modifications throughout the leased spaces. [11] For this reason, the tenant companies would  have been capable of coordinating the installation of explosive materials and  other devices with reasonable certainty that those materials would not be  detected by others. For a demolition plan to work, however, such tenants would  need to be managed as a group, and explosives would need to be placed on enough  floors to ensure the fall of each building through what would otherwise have  been the path of most resistance.
While examining the tenants in each critical area, we should ask – Cui Bono?  That is, who benefited from the destruction of the WTC buildings, and the  resulting War on Terror? The obvious answer includes, primarily, the Bush  Administration and its friends. It also includes overlapping groups of oil and  gas companies, defense contractors, and those who desired to wield undue  influence on international policies related to a wide number of issues from  civil rights to space domination.
The North Tower Impact Zone
On 9/11, American Airlines Flight 11 hit the north face of the north tower  (WTC 1) between floors 94 and 99. In a stunning coincidence, these floors  bracket those that had been upgraded for fireproofing shortly before 9/11. [12] This coincidence was amplified by the fact  that one tenant occupied all of those floors – Marsh & McLennan (Marsh),  which at the time was the world’s largest insurance brokerage company. One other  tenant, Sumitomo Bank, shared part of floor 96 with Marsh.
During the years from 1993 to 2001, Marsh made several modifications to these  floors, in addition to the fireproofing upgrades mentioned above. According to  the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Marsh made  modifications to the south side of floor 94 in 1998. That same year, the PANYNJ  helped Marsh demolish floors 95-98 in order to rebuild the fire alarm and  sprinkler systems. Marsh did further modification work on floor 95 in the year  2000. [13] The full floor fireproofing upgrades  on floors 93 through 100 were accomplished in August through November of 1998,  except for floor 94, which was done in December 1996.
(ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW)
Marsh was a large company, with a number of subsidiaries, including Putnam  Investments, Mercer, Johnson & Higgins, and Guy Carpenter, a company that  occupied floors 47 to 54 of the south tower. Marsh was also known to be  notoriously secretive, and had been likened to the CIA. [14] Its chief executive on 9/11 was Jeffrey  Greenberg, a member of the Brookings Institution, the Trilateral Commission, and  the son of the chairman of American International Group (AIG), Maurice  Greenberg. AIG has been reported to be at the center of a number of CIA  operations. [15]
Jeffrey Greenberg rose quickly through management at Marsh, having come there  directly from AIG in 1995, and then becoming CEO just four years later. At  Brookings, Greenberg hobnobbed with Lee Hamilton, co-chair of the 9/11  Commission, and the Iraqi Nemir Amin Kirdar, CEO of Investcorp, a BCCI-related  company founded by the Saudi Abdullah Taha Bakhsh. [16]
BCCI was founded by a Pakistani named Agha Hasan Abedi, and was ”made up of  multiplying layers of entities, related to one another through an impenetrable  series of holding companies, affiliates, subsidiaries, banks-within-banks,  insider dealings and nominee relationships.” In the early nineties, BCCI was  extensively investigated for money laundering and terrorist financing, and was  ultimately shut-down by the Bank of England in 1992. [17] Like BCCI, AIG developed the same fragmented  and difficult to trace network of subsidiaries, spread across 130 countries and  400 regulators. [18]
Other very powerful and well-connected people worked in senior management at  Marsh. These included Stephen Friedman, a senior principal at Marsh Capital and  former partner at Goldman Sachs, who later became George W. Bush’s top economic  advisor. Friedman was also a member of the Brookings Institution, the Bilderberg  group, the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and the board at In-Q-Tel, the  investment firm founded by the CIA in 1998. In-Q-Tel invests in state of the art  technologies related to defense and intelligence work, including nano and  chemical technologies, according to its website. [19]
In another interesting coincidence, Friedman belonged, through Cornell  University, to a secret society called Quill and Dagger, the membership of which  includes Paul Wolfowitz, Sandy Berger and Stephen Hadley. Wolfowitz, the neo-con  deputy secretary of defense in the Bush Administration, was the author in 1992  of the “Wolfowitz Doctrine” of pre-emptive warfare. He also made comments about  a “surprise like Pearl Harbor” months before 9/11, and met with Pakistani ISI  General Mahmud Ahmed in the week before 9/11. [20] Berger, the National Security Advisor to  President Clinton, was later caught stealing documents from the 9/11 Commission  investigation. [21] Berger was also the boss of  White House counterterrorism Tsar Richard Clarke, and together with Hadley – who  was Condoleeza Rice’s deputy – was responsible for delaying or obstructing  Clarke’s plans to stop Al Qaeda in January 2001. [22]
The President of Marsh Real Estate Advisors, from 1982 to 2001, was Craig  Stapleton, the husband of George W. Bush’s cousin, Dorothy Walker Bush.  Stapleton’s Marsh division was responsible for negotiating office leases in the  US, Canada and Europe. He once co-owned the Texas Rangers with George W. Bush, a  spectacular investment for all involved. In 1997, Stapleton was a member of the  board of a company called Cendant that was charged in 1998 with massive  accounting fraud. The President of Cendant at the time was Henry Silverman, a  former partner of the Blackstone Group and later Vice Chairman of the PANYNJ.  Stapleton went on to join Winston Partners, a privately owned investment firm  founded in 1993 and led by George W. Bush’s bother Marvin.
The Vice Chairman of Marsh on 9/11 was Mathis Cabiallavetta, a Swiss citizen.  Although Cabiallavetta was a member of the Marsh board from 1993 to 2000, he  took his position as Vice Chairman in 1999, after having been President of the  Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) from 1996 to 1998. This was the same UBS that  bailed out George W. Bush’s Harken Energy in 1987, with the help of billionaire  Jackson Stephens. UBS was linked in other ways to the fraudulent terrorist  financing bank BCCI. [16, 23]
Another connection to the Bush family can be seen in the Marsh acquisition of  the New York insurance brokerage Johnson and Higgins in March 1997. Johnson and  Higgins was the long-time employer of Prescott Bush Jr, brother to George H. W.  Bush. Although Prescott Jr. no longer worked there, he had spent 33 years at  Johnson & Higgins, retiring as Senior Vice President. After retirement, Bush  continued to consult for the company, in Asian dealings. With Prescott Jr,  Friedman and Stapleton, Marsh clearly had strong ties to the Bush network.  Additionally, it seems possible that some members of Marsh management,  particularly Stephen Friedman, through In-Q-Tel, had access to technologies that  could have been used to bring about the deceptive demolition of the WTC  buildings.
Add to this L. Paul Bremer, and the possible Marsh ties to demolition  technology become clearer. One month after 9/11, Bremer would become the CEO for  a new division called Marsh Crisis. Interestingly, the Yale graduate Bremer had  been working to complete the National Report on Terrorism, and prior to that had  been managing director for Kissinger Associates. According to a US Senate  report, Kissinger Associates had a number of meetings with BCCI representatives  in the late eighties and early nineties, and it refused to provide documents  requested by the Senate investigators. [17] Bremer was also a member of the board for Akzo Nobel, the parent of  International Paint, a company that produced a fireproofing application for  skyscrapers called Interchar. [24]
Bremer was on the international advisory board for the Japanese mining and  machinery company, Komatsu. At the time, Komatsu had been involved in a joint  venture agreement with Dresser Industries, the oil-services/intelligence front  in which Prescott Bush Sr. and George H. W. Bush got their start with Neil  Mallon. The Komatsu-Dresser mining division operated from 1988 to 1997. In July  1996, it patented a thermite demolition device that could “demolish a concrete  structure at a high efficiency, while preventing a secondary problem due to  noise, flying dust and chips, and the like.” [25] Residues of thermite, the highly energetic  chemical mixture, have been confirmed in samples of the WTC dust, and the use of  thermite at the WTC was also revealed by environmental data. [1, 2, 3, 4, 26] Dresser Industries merged with  Dick Cheney’s Halliburton in 1998.
It is less well known that Bremer’s relationship to Marsh started earlier. In  fact, on 9/11, Bremer was the CEO of Marsh Political Risk Practice and he had an  office in the south tower. That day, he was interviewed on NBC television,  stating that Osama bin Laden was responsible and that possibly Iraq and Iran  were involved too, and he called for the most severe military response possible.  Google removed the interview video from its servers three times, and blocked it  once. [27]
Bremer was called away from Marsh in 2003, to be the Iraq Occupation  Governor. His work in that role has been widely criticized. [28]
The South Tower Impact Zone
United Airlines Flight 175 hit the south tower (WTC 2) between floors 78 and  83, in the southeast corner of the building. In the impact zone, Baseline  Financial Services (Baseline) was located on floors 77 and 78, Fuji Bank was on  floors 79 to 82, and AON Corporation was on floor 83.
Baseline was led by a very interesting individual named Joseph Kasputys, who  had a history of being well connected to the highest levels of government, as  well as to defense and intelligence industries. Kasputys worked, from 1972 to  1977, for the US departments of commerce and defense. He was also the deputy  director of Nixon’s White House taskforce that dealt with the Arab oil embargo  of 1973, and he was instrumental in the creation of the Department of Energy  (DOE).
Kasputys’ connections to the DOE, from 1977 through at least 1997, are  interesting considering that the DOE was developing thermite ignition devices as  early as 1983. [29] Additonally, national  laboratories working within the DOE developed nanothermites in the late 1990s.  Nanothermites are explosive thermite mixtures where one or more reactants are  present at the nanometer scale. These are also called super-thermites due to the  extraordinarily large amount of energy released upon ignition. [3, 30]
Kasputys was also a member of the Logistics Management Institute (LMI), whose  members included Paul Kaminski of In-Q-Tel and General Dynamics, Charles DiBona  of Halliburton, Skull and Bones member Joseph Samuel Nye, and Michael Daniels of  Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). It has been noted that  SAIC, a defense contractor with expertise in thermite-related technologies,  played a large part in the NIST WTC investigation. LMI’s self-proclaimed role is  “advancing the science of government.” [30, 31]
Better known for his leadership of Primark Corporation from 1987 to 2000,  Kasputys was CEO for both companies after the Primark acquisition of Baseline in  1996. Primark owned as many as 50 companies during that time, and was acquired  by Thomson Financial in June 2000. Kasputys then became CEO for Thomson, and he  later founded the intelligence-services company IHS Global Insight, in March  2001. Another Primark company, Primark Decision Economics, was located in the  11th floor of the north tower.
The sheer number of companies involved with Primark, along with the vague  business descriptions given (Baseline was described as “an international  provider of information”), gave the impression that something more than  legitimate business was involved. Primark owned Triad International Maintenance  Company (TIMCO), a company that, among other things, modified Boeing 757s and  767s. Primark also owned The Analytic Sciences Corp (TASC), a security and  intelligence (spying) company that had contracts with the DOE. As CEO of World  Markets Research Centre, Kasputys predicted in 2003 that the US was the country  with the fourth-highest risk of terrorism, and that – “Another September  11-style attack in the US is highly likely.” [32]
According to NIST, Kasputys’ Baseline modified the southeast corner of floor  78 in 1999, exactly where the aircraft hit on 9/11. [33] Floors 77 and 78 were upgraded for  fireproofing in June and April of 1998, respectively.
Another company with an office on floor 78 was First Commercial Bank. This  was a Taiwanese national bank that had, in January 1998, privatized all but one  third of its shares. The other two thirds went to First Commercial Financial  Corp (FCFC) of Seguin, Texas. Unfortunately, it is not clear if FCFC is related  to First Commercial Financial Group (FCFG), owned by Abdullah Taha Bakhsh. FCFG  was a commodities brokerage firm that was forced to distribute its customer  accounts in 1994, after regulators raised concerns about capital shortfalls and  customer complaints. [34] .
Interestingly, another company located in Seguin, Texas is the machinery  manufacturing company, the Alamo Group. Dave Grzelak, CEO of Komatsu-Dresser,  was a director at Alamo. He was also a board member at Aoki Construction Co, a  mining company associated with Prescott Bush Jr, as we’ll see below.
The tenant located just above Baseline, on floors 79 to 82, was Fuji Bank.  Fuji modified the core of floor 78 in 1998, the east wall of floor 80 in 1999,  unknown parts of floor 80 in 2001, and the southeast corner of floor 82 in  1997. [33]
Prior to the year 2000, Fuji Bank was the second largest bank in Japan.  Fuji’s largest investors were Union Carbide, Mobil Oil and Raytheon. In 1996,  Yasuda Trust became a Fuji subsidiary and in September 2000, Fuji merged with  Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), and the International Bank of Japan (IBJ), to form  the largest bank in the world under the name of Mihuzo Holdings. The second  largest at the time was the Sumitomo-Mitsui Banking Corp, formed in October  1999. But the Fuji Bank merger meant that, as of 9/11, Mihuzo Holdings  controlled companies not only in the impact zone of the south tower, but also on  floors 48 to 50 of the north tower by way of DKB.
Toru Hashimoto, chairman of Fuji Bank, was also with Deutsche Securities  Limited Tokyo Branch and is now on the board of Deutsche Bank with Norman  Augustine. Augustine, also known for being the CEO of Lockheed Martin, was  founder of In-Q-Tel and a board member of Riggs National, the banking firm of  Jonathan Bush, the other brother of George H. W. Bush. A 2004 expose by the New  York Times revealed Saudi Arabian accounts at Riggs were being investigated for  money-laundering and possible financing of the September 11th terrorists. [35]
Deutsche Bank was the bank of the German Gestapo during World War II, funding  the construction of concentration camps. It was broken up after the war, only to  merge together again in 1957. [36] In 1998,  Deutsche Bank added Banker’s Trust, which had purchased Alex Brown and Sons in  1997, to its group of companies. It was Deutsche Bank and these subsidiaries  that were identified as being involved in insider trading related to the 9/11  attacks. The person of most interest in these dealings was A.B. Krongard, the  CEO of Alex Brown, and CIA counsel to George Tenet. [37] From 2001 to 2004, Krongard was executive  director of the CIA. Another significant player was Wolfgang Demisch, managing  director at Alex Brown from 1993 to 1998, managing director at UBS Securities  from 1988 to 1993, and member of the board at SAIC.
Fuji Bank had a history, in the early 1990s, of scandal related to fraudulent  loans and gangster connections. It had also been linked to large CIA-related  payments deposited in the Cayman Islands, and to the BCCI connected First  American Bank. [38, 39, 40]
Moreover, Fuji Bank was not the only Mihuzo company that was accused of  criminal activity. In June 1997, executives of DKB were accused of conspiring to  provide $80 million in loans to Ryuichi Koike, a Japanese gangster. Koike used  the money to purchase shares in securities brokerages, like Nomura, Nikko  (located on floor 79 of the north tower), and Daiwa. Some reports put DKB’s  extorted loans to Koike at $272 million. [41] DKB was reported to have made loans to other Yakuza crime syndicates as well,  and in June 1997, the chairman of DKB ultimately resigned over the scandal. [42]
Additionally, Mihuzo subsidiary IBJ was discovered to have generated $2.5  billion in fraudulent loans to a businesswoman named Nui Onoue in 1991. IBJ was  also reported to have indirectly supported predatory lending by securitizing  high-loan-to-value loans to companies like Dallas’ FirstPlus Financial, a  company that shot to financial stardom in 1996 and then collapsed in 1999. Dan  Quayle was on the board of directors. [43]
Back in the summer of 1989, while his brother was President, Prescott Bush  Jr. was the middleman in the takeover of two companies by West Tsusho, a  Tokyo-based investment firm linked to one of Japan’s biggest mob syndicates.  West Tsusho was part of the empire of Susumu Ishii, head of the Inagawa-kai  yakuza gang. In 1992, two days after an article linking him to Bush appeared in  the Daily Yomiuri, Ishii was dead, reportedly from a “long illness.” [44]
At the time, The Boston Globe reported that Prescott Bush Jr. had also been a  business partner with Tokyo-based Aoki Construction Corp (Aoki), in its deals to  build in China. Masahiro Sakane, now the CEO of Aoki, was managing director at  Komatsu from 1994 to 1999. Komatsu and Aoki shared many other links in  management.
The two companies West Tsusho acquired through Prescott Bush Jr., were  Quantum Access (of which Bush was a board member) and Asset Management  International. As a consultant for Asset Management, Prescott introduced Hughes  Aircraft to Japanese investors in a deal in which Hughes and the government of  China would launch satellites that would beam television programming to  broadcasters in China. [45, 46] In December  1989, President Bush lifted the sanctions that blocked the satellite deal,  citing “the national interest.” The Bush administration had earlier granted  Hughes Aircraft “preliminary licenses” to exchange data with Chinese  officials. [47] Also involved in the West Tsusho  mob dealings was Nikko Securities (floor 79 of the north tower).
After his death, West Tsusho’s Susumu Ishii was replaced as the leader of the  Inagawa-kai gang by Toi Inagawa. In September 1996, Inagawa formed an alliance  with Yoshinori Watanabe, head of the largest yakuza gang, Yamaguchi-gumi. Nui  Onoue, who received the fraudulent loans from Mihuzo’s IBJ, was said to be  associated with Yamaguchi-gumi’s Takumi gang, and also an investor in  Inagawa-kai. [41]
Japanese Banks had experienced a relatively tough time in the 1990s, referred  to in financial circles as “the lost decade”, and in general were still doing  badly in the years 2000 and 2001. In November 2000, Mizuho Holdings had problem  loans and bad debts of more than 4 trillion yen ($36 billion). By mid-2001, the  company was trading at half the value it had been at just a year before, when  the merger was announced. [48, 49] Japan’s  financial system began to recover in 2002. [50]
Moving to floor 83 of the south tower, there was AON Corporation, a  Chicago-based competitor of Marsh. Today, General Richard Myers, one of the  people most responsible for not protecting us on 9/11, is a director at AON. But  on 9/11, the most interesting character working for AON was Jim Pierce, the  cousin of George W. Bush. Jim’s father Scott Pierce, formerly a partner at G.H.  Walker & Co, pled guilty to 2,000 counts of mail fraud in 1985, as President  of E.F. Hutton.
Jim Pierce was managing director of AON on 9/11, and he had arranged a  meeting on the 105th floor of the south tower for that morning. Pierce survived  that day, despite the fact that twelve people came to the meeting in the south  tower, and eleven of them died. The location of the meeting had been changed,  the night before, to the Millenium Hotel, where Pierce watched the south tower  as it was hit by the aircraft. Apparently the meeting attendees were not all  notified of the change in location. [51]
AON modifed “unknown” parts of floor 83 in 1997. Some photos of the impact  zone suggest that the most explosive part of the fireball erupting from the  south tower came from the east side of the building, near floor 83 (see NIST  report NCSTAR 1-5A, figure 7-7).
Chuo Trust, which shared floor 83 with AON, was the trust portion of Mihuzo’s  DKB. According to NIST, Chuo modified the southeast corner of floor 83 in 1999.
An unusual feature of the destruction of the south tower was the “cold spot”  on the north face of the building. This section along a twelve-column area of  floors 80, 81, 82 did not experience any fire, despite the fact that the areas  on both sides did have fire. In its report NCSTAR 1-5, NIST “concluded that  insufficient information is available to allow a likely formation mechanism for  the cold spot to be postulated.”
The Washington Group
Another company of interest, on floor 91 just above the impact zone for the  south tower, was Washington Group International (Washington). This company was  known primarily as a construction and mining firm, and it had just acquired  Raytheon Engineers in July 2000. Raytheon was reported to have also occupied  floor 91.
Washington had an interesting history. It had been a contractor for the DOE  and its predecessor agencies since 1942, when it was involved in the Manhattan  Project. In 1995, a management shake-up at Washington resulted in the temporary  installment of William Clark as acting chairman. Clark was a member of the  Center for Security Policy, along with many neo-cons including Richard Perle,  Eliot Abrams, Norman Augustine (In-Q-Tel), Douglas Feith, and 9/11 Commissioner  John Lehman. After re-organizing the management at Washington, in just a few  months, Clark resigned.
In 1996, Washington took over Morrison-Knudsen, an engineering and  construction company that had a history of working on large projects around the  world, including in China, Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. In Vietnam,  Washington led the RMK-BRJ construction project with Brown & Root. During  the 1980s, it worked closely on hazardous clean-up projects for the DOE. The  Army Corps of Engineers hired Morrison-Knudsen to demolish over 200 buildings in  1995. [52]
In 1999, Washington acquired Westinghouse Government Environmental Services  Company (WGESC), a firm that provided management services to the DOE and DOD. In  July 2001, E. Preston Rahe, Jr, the President of WGESC, was promoted to  Executive Vice President of Business Development for Washington Group’s  Government operating unit. Rahe went on to form a new company called Lawrence  Livermore National Security, LLC, along with General John A. Gordon.
Gordon was George H. W. Bush’s Senior Director for Defense Policy on the  National Security Council, and he worked with George Tenet at the CIA from  September 1996 to October 1997, as associate director of central intelligence  for military support, and as deputy director of the CIA from October 1997 to  2000. During this time, Gordon would have worked closely with A.B. Krongard, who  was Tenet’s counsel from 1998 to 2001. Later, in 2003 and 2004, Gordon was  George W. Bush’s Homeland Security advisor.
Apart from Lawrence Livermore labs (LLNL), one of the DOE facilities for  which Washington was responsible, well before 9/11, was the Savannah River site  near Aiken, SC. In February 1997, LLNL and the Savannah River site signed an  agreement of cooperation to share technology. Savannah went on to add  “Developing sol gel technology for fuels and other applications” to its  portfolio. [53, 54] Sol-gel technology is  utilized by LLNL for making nanothermites. [55] In another coincidence, Savannah River Technology staff participated in the  search and rescue operations at Ground Zero by providing unique tools. [56]
Today, Washington is owned by URS Corp, and they still “help manage and  operate Idaho NL, LANL and LLNL,” through a partnership with Battelle. [57] But just before 9/11 they were going through  a tough time financially, and sought chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) documents show that Washington made  court-ordered pre-petition payments, as part of these proceedings, to a number  of companies including Komatsu. Washington also made payments to Greenhorne & O’Mara, whose employee Theresa McAllister was a lead author for the FEMA  and NIST reports on the WTC disaster, and to Sumitomo Bank. [58] Sumitomo Bank was closely allied with  Komatsu, and was involved with defense-related production. [59]
Other floors and companies of interest
If a “top down” demolition were implemented in the WTC’s Twin Towers on 9/11,  then it would have been necessary to plant explosives on floors below the impact  zone. From a novice perspective, it would seem ideal to have planted such  explosives at regular intervals below the impact area, around floor 50, for  example, and below that around floors 25 to 35, and lower. Videos show “squibs”  emanating in these general areas of each tower, at levels spaced between the  mechanical floors on 41-42, and 75-76.
We have seen that Marsh occupied the impact zone for the north tower, and  floors 47 to 54 of the south tower. Additionally, in a reflective criss-cross  pattern, Fuji Bank’s parent company Mihuzo Holdings occupied the impact zone for  the south tower, as well as floors 48 to 50 of the north tower (DKB). Primark  Corporation occupied part of the impact zone for the south tower, and also floor  11 of the north tower.
To evaluate floors 25 to 35 of each tower we should note that, in 1997 and  1998, big leases were signed at the WTC involving AON, Marsh, and Bankers Trust,  and two other companies of interest, Exco Resources and Oppenheimer & Co. At  the time, tenancy had gone way up and the complex was expected to be at full  capacity due to growth of the financial sector. [60]
Exco Resources (Exco), of Dallas Texas, was an oil and gas holding company  that was the parent to Garban Intercapital, located on floor 25 and 26 of the  north tower, and also on floor 55 of the south tower, just above Marsh  subsidiary Guy Carpenter. Exco experienced rapid growth as of 1998, in part due  to some very well connected management representatives. Member of the board Mark  Neporent also represented Cerebrus Capital, along with Dan Quayle. Robert L.  Stillwell, senior partner at Bush friend James Baker’s firm Baker Botts, is  currently a director at Exco.
Directors and Officers at Exco, during the period of interest, were  associated with Enron affiliates, Anadarko Petroleum, a company owned and  operated by long-time Bush family partner Robert Allison, and many other oil and  gas exploration firms. Both Enron and Robert Allison met with Dick Cheney in  regard to his secretive energy task force in early 2001. [61] In general, oil and gas exploration companies  use explosives to underground create shock waves, so that oil reserves can be  found through the seismic responses. Usually there is only a 10% success rate  for finding new productive oil fields. [62]
Another Exco executive was Jeffrey Benjamin, who served on the board of Exco  starting in 1998, and from 1996 to 1998 was managing director of UBS, the BCCI  connected bank mentioned above with Mathis Cabiallavetta and Wolfgang Demisch.  Just prior to working for UBS, Benjamin was managing director of Bankers Trust.  Through Bankers Trust, he worked with A.B. Krongard, and as of 2002, Benjamin is  a senior advisor to Apollo Management with Krongard’s wife, Cheryl Gordon  Krongard.
Oppenheimer & Co, an investment bank, was on floors 31 to 34 of the south  tower. Oppenheimer’s leadership once included Stephen Berger, former executive  director of the PANYNJ (1985 to 1990). Berger was also on the board of Dresser  Industries, the Bush dynasty firm, as well as being on the board of Forstmann  Little & Co. with managing director of the Carlyle Group, Daniel Akerson,  and with Alex Mandl of In-Q-Tel.
Oppenheimer was sold, by Stephen Robert and Nathan Gantcher, to the Canadian  Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in 1997. Mr. Gantcher continued to serve as  Vice Chairman of CIBC Oppenheimer from 1997 to 1999 and also served on the board  of Jacobsen Partners with Gerald Parsky, the former undersecretary of the  Treasury who introduced Saudi investors to America. Parsky developed a close  relationship with the Bushes, and by 1976 was “the undisputed go-to man for the  Saudis on oil and money.” He also raised a lot of money for George W’s  campaign. [63] Parsky, Gantcher and Stephen  Robert were all members of the Council on Foreign Relations as of 1997, along  with Friedman, Bremer, Augustine, Gordon, and Maurice Greenberg (and about 3,000  others).
CIBC Oppenheimer was invested in a number of powerful and politically wired  companies, including Hollinger International, whose board included Henry  Kissinger, Richard Perle, and 9/11 Commissioner James R. Thompson. CIBC  Oppenheimer was also invested in Robert Allison’s Anadarko Petroleum, and  several DKB subsidiaries including CIT Group, on whose board sits 9/11  Commissioner Thomas Kean. On a side note, Kean is also a Trustee of Drew  University with Garnett Keith of Komatsu.
In 2003, the SEC fined CIBC Oppenheimer $80 million for helping to manipulate  the financial statements of Enron.
Conclusions and next steps
If we look at the companies that occupied the impact zones of the WTC towers,  and other floors that might have played a useful role in the demolition of the  towers, we see connections to organizations that had access to explosive  materials, and to the expertise required to use explosives. Mining companies  like Washington, Morrison-Knudsen, Komatsu and Aoki Construction (and John  Lehman’s Special Devices Inc.) have access to many types of explosive materials.  Oil and gas companies, like those associated with Exco, use explosives for  exploration. Some of the explosive technologies available to these companies,  for example Komatsu and Washington, involve thermite, a chemical mixture that  has been identified in the WTC dust and in the environmental data at Ground  Zero.
It seems that, if certain management representatives of the tenant companies  listed above wanted to help bring the WTC towers down, they would have been well  suited to do so. The companies mentioned were located at well-spaced intervals  in the buildings, and some, for example Marsh and the Primark subsidiaries, had  a reputation of being secretive. In fact, a number of the executives from these  firms were either on the board of intelligence firms (e.g. In-Q-Tel, TASC), or  were closely related to others who were. Others were connected to the CIA  itself, and to some of the largest defense contractors in the world, like  Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Halliburton, and SAIC.
There are also strong connections to those who benefited from the 9/11  attacks, most notably the Bush family and their corporate network, including  Dresser Industries (now Halliburton) and UBS, and to Deutsche Bank and it  subsidiaries, reported to have brokered the insider trading deals. There are  links between these tenant companies and the terrorist-related fraudulent bank  BCCI.
In Part II of this series of essays, we’ll look at the security companies and  other contractors that had access to the WTC buildings. We’ll then see more  connections to the Bush family, through the companies that restructured the  security systems in the late 1990s, like Securacom, where Marvin Bush and Wirt  Walker were directors. Also involved in these security upgrades was Ensec, where  future Democrat National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe was added as a  director in 1996 and later worked for Harken Energy’s Alan Quasha. The second  essay will also look at E.J. Electric, owned by J. Robert Mann of the Yale Glee  Club, and examine particulars about the PANYNJ management staff, and the  Giuliani and Silverstein teams that were involved.
Part III will review the clean up of Ground Zero, and some of the people  involved in the cover-up investigations. For example, we’ll look more closely at  Donald Evans, a close friend to George W. Bush since 1968 and his largest  fund-raiser, and who also happened to be secretary of the Department of Commerce  during the NIST WTC investigation. This is interesting because NIST reports to  the Secretary of Commerce.
In the end, we might see that conspiracies are not just limited to the  powerless people who happen to live on the most strategically important lands in  the world. The conspiracies that matter might involve the powerful people who  seek access to those lands, and who have spent their lives seeking more power.
