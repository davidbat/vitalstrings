The Twin Towers: A History
Watch  MetroTV  on September 11.
Tune in for a journey that explores the design, construction, and ultimate destruction of New York City's World Trade Center. The Twin Towers were never fully appreciated architecturally, though they came to symbolize the United States'  cultural and financial position in the world. The film features commentary from David Rockefeller and the New Yorker's architecture critic Paul Goldberger, but at its heart are the contruction workers who built the 110 stories of steel and concrete.
