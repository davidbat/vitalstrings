Spencer's is a great version. I did consider building my own version based on his design but it was too big for my liking so I used my own different design. His is very good; but I doubt it could go any smaller. The bricks used to mimick the windows on his work well for that size. I think the effect would be lost if the building was smaller; that is one advantage of using the small ridged bricks. Its still good though.
