Excerpted from DAILY MAIL: Canadians have been left confused over the country’s new $20-dollar bill which some have said appeared to feature three naked woman and the World Trade Center towers.
The government was rolling out the new banknote as part of an upgrade of the monetary system. It actually features the Vimy Memorial in northern France, the largest monument overseas for Canadian soldiers lost the First World War.
However many Canadians believed the bill showed the Twin Towers and three topless women along with the head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.
