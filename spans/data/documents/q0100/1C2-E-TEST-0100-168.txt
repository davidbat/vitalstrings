It was startling to see high above, birds circling in the beams suddenly appear and disappear. For many of us, seeing the presence of creatures of flight and their ability to soar high above connects us with the spirits of all those who we remembered as having been apart of our lives.
This spherical panorama was taken on the last day at 10:47 PM - Jook Leung
