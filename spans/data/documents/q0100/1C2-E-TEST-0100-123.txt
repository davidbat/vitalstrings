What happened?
The Bush cabal in the White House helped facilitate Al Qaida's hijacking of those planes.
People at the WTC said they smelled cordite, an explosive, when the buildings fell.
The guy who owned the WTC just months earlier had taken out billion dollars insurance policies on both towers.
There weeks before 9/11 there were lots of "put" orders on airlines and insurance company stocks on Wall Street.
One WTC building 7 fell BEFORE the planes hit the main two towers.
The "plane" (some people said it looked like a Tomahawk missle) that hit the Pentagon just happened to hit the side of the Pentagon that was under construction.
BTW, with the exception of an engine recovered at the site, where are the bodies and the other plane wreckage from the plane that hit the Pentagon?  No one knows...
Debris from the WTC was sent abroad to be destroyed/recycled, thereby making any sort of scientific examination of the wreckage impossible.
9/11 was an inside job, and not a very clever or sophisticated one at that.
It was used to a) solidify Dubya's illegitimate, stolen presidency and b) start a war with Iraq and Afghanistan.

To the people who gave me a thumbs down, please refute everything I've said, point by point.
Of course you want b/c you'd rather keep sleeping in your dream world.  Sleep on sheep...
