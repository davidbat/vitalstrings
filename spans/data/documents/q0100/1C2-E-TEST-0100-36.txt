The Twin Towers and the New World Trade Center
After the September 11 terrorist attacks, two trident (3-pronged) columns from the Twin Towers were salvaged from the ruins to be incorporated into the design of the National 9/11 Museum at Ground Zero.
Architects also paid homage to the the lost Twin Towers by giving the new skyscraper, One World Trade Center ("Freedom Tower"), similar dimensions. Measuring 200 feet square, the footprint of One World Trade Center matches each of the Twin Towers. Excepting for the spire, One World Trade Center is 1,368 feet tall, like Tower One. If you also exclude the parapet, One World Trade Center is 1,362 feet tall, like Tower Two.
