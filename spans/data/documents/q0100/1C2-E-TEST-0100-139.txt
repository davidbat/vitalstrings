A painting by a Michigan artist has gained popularity since the September 11 terrorist attacks.
In 1996, Michigan artist Lynn Morgan said the Lord gave him a picture to paint. His painting, titled “The Harvest Fields,” shows Jesus standing in a wheat field, looking off into the distance at some of the world's best-known buildings and landmarks. Among the buildings are the twin towers of the World Trade Center, which took on added significance after the terrorist attacks.
Morgan says the painting is based on John 4:35, when Jesus told His disciples that the fields were white for harvest.
“As Christians, in our own individual ways and corporately as a body of believers, [we need] to reach out and fulfill the Great Commission, and that's really what this painting is about,” Morgan says. “It's not about buildings or wheat fields necessarily, but … the buildings and the rural areas in the painting represent the souls of man, and the idea is that Christ is Lord over all.”
“The Harvest Fields” is also a puzzle distributed by the New Hampshire-based White Mountain Puzzles. The company is finding that Morgan's inspirational print is one of its most popular puzzles. Cronan Minton, who is with the puzzle maker, says Morgan obviously could not have envisioned the tragedy that was going to happen at the World Trade Center, but that in the painting, Jesus actually seems to be looking at the Twin Towers.
Other inspirational paintings by Morgan include “The Great Lion of Judah,” “If My People,” and “The Miracles.” All of his paintings can be viewed on his website: www.lynnmorganart.com .
