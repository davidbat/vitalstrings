1 Force Unit = 1 FU = 1 DL(15) = weight of one 15-Floor-Steel-Block _______________________________________________________
1 Energy Unit = 1 EU = (1 FU)*(#meters fallen) = (1 DL(15))*(# of meters fallen) = mgh = F*h _______________________________________________________
Collision Forces, Collision Momentums, and Collision Energies are each equally distributed, equally conducted, and equally transferred throughout the entire 95-Floor-Steel-Block, through all Columns and all Beams, and down into the lower Steel Basement Floors, and then down into the Bedrock that the WTC Towers are embedded within. The Forces, Momentums, and Energies are not only absorbed by the top-most floor, alone, as the Original Conspiracy Theorists would have you believe. And this is where the Physics-knowledge-deficient-Public has been fooled, duped, and deceived. It simply is not true what the 911 Commission and their Media Cohorts & their Hired-Science-Cohorts and their parroting and misguided Naysayers have been propagandizing and conspiring about.
Steel is a very highly Energy-conductive and Energy-Transformational material. Steel can easily assist and aid in the transformation, transfer, conduction, and dissipation of all of the following types of Energies: Heat, Kinetic-Collision (vibration-transfer, shock-transfer, Seismic-transfer), electricity, magnetism, Wind, and Sound. The Energies, Momentums, and Forces are all transformed, conducted, transferred, and dissipated from the top of the Twin Tower, passing all the way through it, all the way to the bottom, and is then dissipated into the Bedrock of the Earth.
Again, the Original Conspiracy Theorists (OCT) and their Groupies, Devotees and Supporters are all relying on the Public's lack of knowledge of basic Physics to "pull the wool over their eyes" by means of massive deception and propaganda techniques (TV, Radio, Newspapers, Magazines, Books, the Internet, etc.
They are blatantly distorting or ignoring the historically-established Laws of Physics & Chemistry, the two most fundamental of the Sciences and they are doing a stupendously-successful job of it!!!
Do not allow yourself to be deceived, duped, and fooled and please pass this information along to you family and friends and everyone you possibly can.
Conclusions:
(633 FU UP for the 95-Floor-Steel-Block):(1FU DOWN for the 15-Floor-Block)
Also,
100*DL(95) = 20*LL(95)
= 20*5*DL(95) means you could top-stack 100 95-Floor-Steel-Blocks before the Total Collapse -Load Force-Limit is reached allowing Total-Collapse to occur.
Expansion of the Collapse-Load Equation Theory:
The Structural Steel at the top of the WTC was only about (1/4) inch thick.
Compare that to Steel at the bottom level Floors of the WTC as being 4 inches thick.
This means that the more truthful and Scientifically arrived at value for CL(95) will be multiples greater than (633 *DL(95)), perhaps a mathematical-multiple of 10,
giving:
CL(95) (revised) = 10*(633*DL(15))
= 6,330 DL(15)
= 6,330 Vector Anti-Collapse Force Units (FU) upward, as opposed to one
Vector weight Force Unit down, (DL(15)). _________________________________________________________________ This The same Factored Ratio of (6,330:1) can also be applied to opposing Momentums and to opposing Energies. One EU is gained by a DL(15), for each meter it is raised about the top of the 95th Floor. It will have to be raised 6,330 meters and dropped to provide the Energy to produce Total Collapse & Failure of a 95-Floor-Steel-Block, If this extension of my Thesis is TRUE. ___________________________________________________________________
Structure vs. Property Relationship
between a Steel WTC Twin Tower and a Model Balsa Wood Bridge.
(Property to consider is Support Strength Force or Anti-Collapse Resistance Force vs. 3-D Octet Truss Bridge structure.
Please follow This Scientific-Method Experimental-Model Analogy below:
The Weight-Force-Scale pictured can hold or read 200 pounds, max.
We wish to compare the Load-Bearing results for the Bridge to the potential Load-Bearing Support or Anti-Collapse strength for a WTC Tower.
(CL/DL) = (Collapse-Load / Dead-Load). These Ratios can go higher than 4200:1 for a 16-gram Balsa Wood Arch-Bridge, which can top-load well over 150 Pounds, when Collapse-Load Tested using the above pictured apparatus setup. This means you could apply a downward Force equivalent to the weight of 4200 bridges on the top of the Bridge, as shown in the above photos, before Total-Collapse could take place.
This result is a valid scientific Analogy that is being Scientifically-Applied to the WTC Twin Towers, proving that a (CL/DL) Ratio of 633:1 is definitely not numerically out of line with the way these inter-connected structures perform under Collapse-Load conditions of downward Force.
(The Bridge 3-D structures are modeled after the Atomic-Crystalline Structure of a Diamond, which is the same 3-D Structure as the famous ‘Octet-Truss’, making Diamond the hardest, strongest substance known.)
Bridge Model Calculations:
(CL / DL) = (150 Pounds / 16 Grams) = (67,200 Grams / 16 Grams) = (4,200 /1) = 4,200 : 1 for a Balsa-Wood Bridge composed of 3/16 inch square sticks with no overlapping of wood components and basic acetone-based glue applied to the points of structural-connection.
One of the greatest Scientific Truths or Laws ever established by the Sciences of Physics and Chemistry is the following:
The Physical Properties of a 3-D Structure are a direct consequence of a material’s 3-D Physical Structure and the Material’s Chemical (i.e., Atomic, Molecular, and Crystalline Structural Makeup. The stronger the material, the stronger the Structure, and the better the 3-D Structure of the Structure the stronger the Structure. (An outstanding example would be a 3-D OCTET Structure composed of high and Custom-Propertied Steel). This is what the real and true Structural-Science and Engineering of building Power Structures, of any kind for any application, is all about.
The Physical Properties of a Structure are based primarily on two things:
1) What material the 3-D Structure is actually composed of:
Examples:
1. metal (High-Propertied steel, Tin, Copper, and Aluminum…)
2. wood (Balsa, Maplewood, Bamboo…)
3. rock (granite, marble, limestone, Chalkstone…)
4. fabricated-brick
5. fabricated-cement (Cinder-Block, poured Cement…)
6. Foam (Styrofoam, Urethane Foam, Rubber Foam, Rigid-Foam…)
And:
2) The actual 3-D Inter-Connected Structure of the Structure in question:
Examples:
