Documenta (13) AND AND AND
In 2010, the artist run platform of AND AND AND, the director and staff of dOCUMENTA(13), and the organization of Twin Towers Go Global (TTGG), began to issue a series of three special 9/11 anniversary reports (2010, 2011, 2012). Like all other projects in the AND AND AND series, these reports are part of dOCUMENTA(13).
The Second Report is now up on the dOCUMENTA(13) website:

Issued yesterday in Kassel, Germany, the current report focuses on the TTGG’s recent “ Open Call ”, a competition where people were invited to imagine the Twin Towers rebuilt around the world. Almost sixty proposals were submitted between July 31 and September 2, 2011. Five winners were selected by a specialized jury, and another five through an international public vote.
