Pictures taken from 10:32 am to 11:07 am on Sep 11, 2001. Place: Walking down the Broadway towards WTC, Downtown Manhattan.
People watching the TVs placed outside the stores. About ten blocks away from the carnage.. Time 10:32 am, 2 minutes after the second tower fell.
View of the towers (missing now) from the same place.. taken 20 minutes after the above one. (I was busy buying film rolls in the meanwhile!)
One of the nearest hospitals getting ready to treat the survivors.. They were in for a big disappointment.
If they (whoever it was) thought they succeeded in killing a lot of Americans, they were wrong. The majority of people who died in the WTC may have been American citizens, but then most of them were immigrants from other countries who became citizens - Arabs, Palestinians, Indians, Chinese etc - THE REAL NEW YORKERS.
Feeling: Is this part of a movie? Everyone was numb, there was no fear, and the pain was yet to sink in.
Ambulances covered in soot making their way uptown carrying the injured.
The two buildings, which stood there, united, were no longer in sight - gone forever. Nothing can replace them ever.
People not believing the view in front, listening to radios to make sure it is real ...
The WTC burning in the background..
