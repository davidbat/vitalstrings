Inside Job or not, this event has been the central focus on most if not all actions taken by the US government. We have given up so many of our rights for the promise of safety. Patriot Act, TSA, ATF, you name it, they got it. My point is, how does giving up your freedom keep you safe? If you aren't free, obviously, someone has defeated you. Can't both sides of thisï»¿ argument come together at least on this point?
