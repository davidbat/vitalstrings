TWIN TOWERS COLLAPSE WTC COLLAPSE WTC WTC COLLAPSE TWIN TOWER COLLAPSE WTC COLLAPSE: TWIN TOWERS Collapse World Trade Center collapse PLANE CRASH WTC missile WTC falling down.  WHAT YOUTUBE DOESN´T WANT YOU TO KNOW...FUCK THEM: THEY DELETED THIS RESULT FROM A "WTC COLLAPSE" SEARCH , IT WAS THE 5TH HIGHEST BEFORE JANUARY 2010.   September 4, 2001: Israeli Company Moves Out of WTC. The Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co. moves their North American headquarters from the 16th floor more...of the WTC to Norfolk, Virginia, one week before the 9/11 attacks.  The Israeli government owns 49 percent of the company. [VIRGINIAN-PILOT, 9/4/2001] More than 200 workers had just been moved out; about ten are still in the building making final moving arrangements on 9/11, but escape. [JERUSALEM POST, 9/13/2001; JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 10/18/2001]  The move leaves only one Israeli company, ClearForest, with 18 employees, in the WTC on 9/11. The four or five employees in the building at the time manage to escape. [JERUSALEM POST, 9/13/2001]  One year later, a Zim ship is impounded while attempting to ship Israeli military equipment to Iran; it is speculated that this is done with the knowledge of Israel. [AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, 3/29/2002]   Six weeks before the WTC 911 attack, heavy machine building was going on, after the company Aon (Jew owned) had moved elsewhere and all the office space of the﻿ 98th floor had become vacant.  Weeks before 911, there was a planned power-down for the WTC buildings during one weekend. Many workers were drilling and pulling wires all over. None of the security equipement worked, as electricity was only available to the "maintenance workers".  Bomb sniffing dogs were removed from the buildings...   Guess who was the contractor for the security of the WTC complex???  George W. Bush´s brother﻿ Marvin´s Securacom/Stratesec...  NAH, JUST A COINCIDENCE. YEP.  For the record:  Straight Down Collapse=Demolition. Near Free Fall Speed=Demolition. Melted Down Steel Core Collums= Demolition. Hightech Nanotermite explosives= Demolition. Larry Silverstein "Pull It" on WTC-7= Demolition.  Watch the news:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDYe5d5Zj9s  Sometimes﻿ they even "inform"    WTC Worker Scott Forbes:  On the weekend of 9/8,9/9 there was a 'power down' condition in WTC tower 2, the south tower. This power down condition meant there was no electrical supply for approx 36hrs from floor 50 up. I am aware of this situation since I work in IT and had to work with many others that weekend to ensure that all systems were cleanly shutdown beforehand, and then brough back up afterwards. The reason given by﻿ the WTC for the power own was that cabling in the tower was being upgraded.  Of course without power there were no security cameras, no﻿ security locks on doors and many, many 'engineers' coming in and out of the tower. I was at home on the morning of 9/11 on the shore of Jersey City, right opposite the Towers, and watching events unfold I was convinced immediately that something was happening related to the weekend work ...      2000 LIVES KILLED ON WTC BUILDINGS= 7 BILLION DOLLARS GAIN BY LARRY (AKA "THE JEW ROBBER") SILVERSTEIN  ocultar
