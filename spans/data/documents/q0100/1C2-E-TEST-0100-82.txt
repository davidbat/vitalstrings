From Dust we Came and to Dust we shall return. We are all alone and all alone together, as one. What difference does the opinion of what someone thinks of the new WTC - It will be what it is - the memory of those lost in the tragedy of 9/11 are sought to be remembered, not the continued sorrow of what has gone - Remember, celebrate life and live what you have now. In 100 years this building will be considered OLD and oter buildings may tower far above it - or this earth could be gone, enjoy the now. It's beautiful and so is life.

If I could have rated this completely unimaginative design lower I would have.  A 4 year old with a box of legos could have done better.  SOM should be embarrassed, and the city of New York should have demanded better.  It is a beacon of mediocrity... a sad realization of what our nation has become.

This building is a trophy for the terrorists. Don't let the terrorists alter our skyline. Rebuild new twin towers. This will start the healing process for America. This building what they are doing is a giant middle finger to Americans. Over 90% of New Yorkers want their towers back. Politicans using 9/11 as a renovation to build what they want and ignoring the voice of the American people. Rebuild the twin towers stronger, taller.

This alleged replacement of the former Twin Towers is typical of the gutless, non-creative, and inept NYC leadership, that has caused this project to run years behind scheduled completion, and will deliver to us an architectural design by committee, at its worst.  What a shame!

This is to all the idiots who took the time to rant about Israel and the terrorists. Israel didn't bring down the towers you morons. Those arab morons did by flying those planes into them! If you don't like it here in the U.S. - leave! We don't need you here nor want you here!This building is quite an awesome sight! It says "We stand tall and strong and we believe in our freedom!" A shining symbol of America! Ignore the naysayers and downers. We could never have satisfied everyone with any design. The building is a strong symbol and it points to heaven where all the souls of those lost in this tragedy are now resting (except the terrorists). It says we stand strong and we will never forget! It is a bold strong statement.

I just visited the site and was very disappointed with the plan and LACK of symbolism associated with only one tower.  How does this tell the world that we rebuild better and stronger after the attacks?  Add more floors, put up two of them, and add gun turrets if necessary but please, not this wimpy little plan.

This "SINGLE" tower design doesn't compare to the original twin towers.  C'mon, really?  It has 3,000,000 "LESS" square feet than the original.  The roof height is the same as the original 1WTC's, albeit less floors, 105 floors vs the original's 110 floors.  The needle spike thingy doesn't make up for it's lack of totality.  It doesn't appear to belong in NYC's skyline either.  It is rather dull and uninspiring.Sorry, I'm disappointed.  I thought the rebuilding of the WTC was supposed to symbolize our strength and resolve as a nation?  We can't even call this building the Freedom Tower because it might offend someone.  Ah, but I digress.  Maybe there are financial reasons?  Is it financial?  It has been reported that the total cost will be 4 billion dollars.  That's 2 billion over the original budget.  You couldn't squeeze an extra tower out of that?  If it was a question of finances, maybe we shouldn't have built it in the first place?  Symbolically, though, it represents a neutered America.

The cut-in base for the new tower is a very bold and ultra-modern touch. At first I thought it looked odd but the more I looked at it the more admiration I had for the designers. The plan is superb and this building will fittingly be seen as the vanguard for 21st century architecture. May God bless the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and their families and friends.

This building is a national disgrace and there is absolutely nothing unique about it at all. Go visit a city such as Shanghai or Tokyo sometime and you'll notice that there's plenty of Freedumb Tower look a likes. Yes this building does represent moving on. It represents moving on to an America where the elites such as the Bloombergs, Patakis, and the Silversteins call the shots instead of the people. Gee that's something to look forward to alright. Too bad I can't give this building a zero stars, it truly deserves it.

This structure will be NO SAFER than the original buildings that were there.  ANY building that is struck by an aircraft of that size and full of fuel is going to come down.  Remember the surrounding buildings also collapsed due to the fires and NOT from being weakened by the collapse of the two towers!!   If it were up to me those original towers would have been restored in their EXACT footprint exactly as they were originally built.

He was always was so proud to have been able to work in the Twin Towers, of the World Trade Center. Two new twins would be the perfect "Tribute in Light!"

I think the new tower will be a symbol of hope and rememberance.  We should never try and duplicate what was there before but build to remember and honour those that have lost loved ones.  It should be beautiful, a place for people to visit and remember whilst life goes on.  Looking at the plans it shouts hope peace and beauty. There can never be two of anything - it would always be second best to the buildings that were there first - so lets start anew and build something to be proud of and remember those great people that lost their lives in such a tragic way.  This building should shine and gleem for all to see and it should always remind us of what went before but never ever replace it - it was special and should always remain one of a kind.  God bless America and keep us all safe the world over from the terror thats out there and the cowards that bring it to our shores.

Dear KevinYou’re mistaken with your opinion like most number of ordinary Americans who got bluffed by the controlled-directed media. The ppl who you call them “terrorists” didn’t attack the twin towers because they’re against the freedom and stuff, they attached the twin towers & the pentagon and other targets as re act for the following:- The US military presence in the Gulf and Middle East.- The US full support to “Israel” who is occupying and killing the Palestinians each day.The twin towers & pentagon were very famous and most of the financial/military powers are located there so that is why they were targeted in order to deliver huge impact. The number of civilians ppl got killed in collapsed of the twin towers were not and will not match at all the number of ppl got killed or getting killed till now in the Middle East either on the Americans hand or on the hands of the cancer they inserted in the area which is called “Israel”.

To begin with, my deepest sorrow for those who died or suffered cause of the 9/11 attacks. In Brazil in 1974 we had this big building fire ( Joelma Building - due a short circuit ) where all but 200 people lost their lives there. Few years later they reconstruct the whole 25 story office-block tower. Since this reconstruction no one feel like renting or anything else, after 36 years, São Paulo still feel for all those who died on that spot. I try to figure out if the same thing would happen up there in NYC, considering that the tragedy is at least fifteen times more expressive than the one which happened here in Brazil. Maybe just a nice square, and a memorial for the victims would bring everybody more peace than some big building. I know the American people, whom I respect, are strong minded, but let us hope the terrorists are not. My best wishes for you all.

Are you kidding me?  What a joke.  This is so obviously terrible.  Build new Twin Towers, structurally different and modernized, but twin Towers none the less.  Over 90% of New Yorkers and other citizens prefer new Twin Towers according to several polls.  In America, we REBUILD.  We don't privatize a nationally important development site and then place a corner-carved FREEDOM COWARD in the place of what was once majesty.  If this is completed, it will be a sad day for us all.  For those who want to fight, go to www.twintowersalliance.com.  I did.

The fact that this is being built, proves that America is trying to get back on it's feet and saying, "Screw You Bin Laden! Is that all you got?!" We are one of the only countries that are truly free in this world. We volunteer, work hard and respect others. Bin Laden is a pig who hides, bribes and manipulates others to do his dirty work. What we are doing right now with this Freedom Tower is showing what acheivements we are making. Japan and China may be making our things, but we have the freedom. We have the power to save lives. We have sacrificed a lot for our nation and I know for a fact that this pig or any other terrorist won't stop us. It's just another obstacle in our way that we hurdle over and keep on moving up.

I think this a stupid idea. I mean, this isn't replacing anything. You can't replace the twin towers.. you just can't. I think they should just build a new set of twin towers because it shows that we will never give up. but this is letting the terrorists know that they have won. they won the battle, is that what you want ? & How do you know that they aren't going to fly a plane into the freedom tower ? I mean, they can do that, which would be more depressing. if they aren't going to build another twin towers, then they shouldn't build anything .

I am very against the restoration of a World Trade Center here. This is the site of bloodiest single day in America since the War against the States. Just as it is wrong for any kind of cooperate or private development on fields like Gettysburg or Vicksburg it is just as inappropriate to rebuild over the hallowed turf of 9/11. Much of the space within the new Freedom Tower will go to the highest bidding tenants. Firms and brokers will pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for space in this new technologically advanced center. There they will make millions. It is WRONG! The whole thing should be a museum/monument. A place that has changed our country more than any other time than the War against the States or WWII should be respected and honored as much with no revenue but nonprofit to be made. I proposed erecting two monuments exactly to scale and shape as the original buildings in the original WTC towers footprints; and exactly the same heights (1,368 and 1,362 ft). These towers would be made of granite from each of the 50 states. Inside there would be enough space for a large and grand musume and thousands of artifacts and memorials of 9/11. (Think of, on a smaller scale, inside the Statue of Liberty, Washington and San  Jacinto Monuments). The best part is that from a distance the NYC skyline will have retained it's old real beauty. The stone towers up close of multi-colored granite would be just as beautiful. They'd be the most massive monuments in the world. The stone towers would be strong enough to deflect hits from a space shuttle or 747 jet. An office style building like the proposed new WTC structures will be no more safe from air attack than the original buildings. Regardless of new safety features no tenant building can be created strong enough to repel a 9/11 style attack. It is arrogance, greed, and forgetfulness. Two tower monuments in the footprints of the old towers replicating their size and shape with full public access would do, show, and be so much more than even the highest new world trade center. If we can build a Freedom tower we can surely build much simpler stone towers instead.
