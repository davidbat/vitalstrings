Central Park and Uptown is a few blocks north from here, hidden by the Empire in this panorama view.    Watching a little less north there’s Madison Square Park with the Flatiron Building in front (23rd St) and even less north the green of Union Square Park (14 St).    Close to the edge of the WTC rooftop you are standing on, you can see some trees, that's Washington Market Park in Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan.    Direction north east you can see the Queensborro Bridge (aka 59th St Bridge) crossing the East River over Roosevelt Island connecting Manhattan with Queens on Long Island.    Watch at the right corner of the rooftop of the WTC Twin Tower you are standing on, there are two other famous buildings of downtown Manhattan:    at the left with the pyramide roof, that's the U.S. Court House Building (500 Pearl Str) and at the right you can see the spire of the Municipal Building (at 1 Centre Street).
