Fifth Anniversary World Trade Center Commemorative Proof
This truly unique non-monetary commemorative is created using two distinct struck pieces. First, a traditional proof is struck with frosted relief on a mirror-like background. Then, a magnificent skyline of the Twin Towers is struck separately to fit the base. Then the two pieces are clad in 15 mg each of 24 KT pure gold and .999 Pure Silver – priceless silver recovered from a bank vault in the ashes of Ground Zero. The Twin Towers can be raised to stand on the face of the proof – the proof is transformed into a standing sculpture of the Twin Towers! On the obverse is our promise: “We Will Never Forget” and “In Memory September 11, 2001” above the double date 2001-2006. On the reverse, a powerful eagle proclaims “God Bless America” under 5 stars, one for each year since 9/11. The stunning design of this magnificent September 11th memorial proof is a 24 KT gold and .999 Pure Silver clad tribute to all who were lost on that fateful day.      5th Anniversary
