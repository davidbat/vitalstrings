Remembering the World Trade Center Twin Towers
Remembering the World Trade Center.
Its Twin Towers, it's Community and its Citizens who perished Tuesday morning
on September 11, 2001.
We are all deeply saddened and appalled by the tragic events of September 11th, 2001.
Five days later, I visited candle light vigils from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade at sunrise
and later from Pier A Park in Hoboken, NJ at sunset.
Looking West at the changed downtown NYC skyline from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade.
Sunrise on a clear morning, smoke from the collapsed towers drifts south obscuring Liberty Island - Sunday, Sept. 16, 2001 6:48 AM
