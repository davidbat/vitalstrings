COLLAPSE         OF WORLD TRADE CENTER TWIN TOWERS
Both towers were tube-like, and the majority of their         support came from exterior columns. There was also a         cluster of columns in the center of the building         connected to the exterior columns by floor trusses.
THE         COLLAPSES:
WHAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED
After the planes struck the                 towers, thousands of gallons of jet fuel burned.
Thick layers of insulation on                 exterior and interior steel columns were                 breached, and sprinkler systems were disabled.
Fires broke out with temperatures                 reaching perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 degrees                 Fahrenheit.
The steel column systems, softened                 in the heat, separated from each other and                 buckled.
Weighted down by debris,                 furniture, concrete and steel, floors                 progressively collapsed.

STRUCTURAL DETAILS OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE         TOWERS
The twin towers, framed         in structural steel, had exterior moment frames with         14-in. steel box columns spaced 39 in. centers. The         configuration created a complete tube around the         building. The central steel core carried gravity loads         only. The exterior tube provided all the lateral         resistance. Horizontal steel trusses spanned 60 ft from         the exterior wall to the core. Concrete on metal deck         completed the floor diaphragm.
The twin towers were part of a         seven-building complex designed by architect Minoru         Yamasaki that covers eight city blocks. An 800 x 400-ft         foundation box, 65-ft-deep and with 3-ft-thick retaining         walls, is under more than half the complex, including the         twin towers and the adjacent hotel. The complex was         completed in phases beginning in 1970 (ENR 7/9/64 p. 36).

Each tower contained about 100,000 tons of steel and 4         in. of concrete topping on the 40,000-sq-ft floors,         according to Henry H. Deutch, assistant to the chief         structural engineer for construction manager Tishman         Realty & Construction Co. Inc., New York City, during         the construction of the WTC and currently head of HHD         Consultants Inc., Osceola County, Fla.
Deutch says that originally, the north         tower contained asbestos in its cementitious fireproofing         as did the first 30 stories of the south tower. He         believes the asbestos, which had been encapsulated, was         removed after the 1993 bombing. In a press conference,         Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the city's health         department had tested the air in the area and found no         undue amount of chemical agents.
Millions across the nation also "saw" the         towers collapse, through live television news coverage.         The south tower fell at 10 a.m. and the north tower at         10:29 a.m.
Reports indicate that the impact of each plane         compromised the structural integrity of each tower,         knocking out perimeter columns and the interior         structure. The explosions then caused further damage,         sweeping through several floors. "These were         airliners scheduled for long flights, full of fuel,         causing massive explosions," says Richard M. Kielar,         a Tishman senior vice president. "No structure could         have sustained this kind of assault," says Kielar.
As the fires burned, the structural steel on the breached         floors and above would have softened and warped because         of the intense heat, say sources. Fireproofed steel is         only rated to resist 1,500 to 1,600° F. As the structure         warped and weakened at the top of each tower, the frame,         along with concrete slabs, furniture, file cabinets, and         other materials, became an enormous, consolidated weight         that eventually crushed the lower portions of the frame         below.
Jon D. Magnusson, chairman-CEO of Skilling Ward Magnusson         Barkshire Inc., Seattle, structural engineer for the         original World Trade Center, agrees: "From what I         observed on TV, it appeared that the floor diaphragm,         necessary to brace the exterior columns, had lost         connection to the exterior wall."
When the stability was lost, the exterior columns buckled         outward, allowing the floors above to drop down onto         floors below, overloading and failing each one as it went         down, he says.
A big question for implosion expert Mark Loizeaux,         president of Controlled Demolition Inc., the Phoenix,         Md., is why the twin towers appeared to have collapsed in         such different ways. Observing the collapses on         television news, Loizeaux says the 1,362-ft-tall south         tower, which was hit at about the 60th floor, failed much         as one would like fell a tree. That is what was expected,         says Loizeaux. But the 1,368-ft-tall north tower,         similarly hit but at about the 90th floor, "telescoped," says Loizeaux. It failed         vertically, he adds, rather than falling over. "I         don't have a clue," says Loizeaux, regarding the         cause of the telescoping.
Security measures were tightened at the 12-million-sq-ft         WTC complex after a terrorist bomb on Feb. 26, 1993. That         bomb blew out one section of a north tower basement         X-brace between two of the perimeter columns. The blast         ripped out sections of three structural slabs in the         basement levels between the north tower and the hotel,         threatening the structural integrity of the foundation         box. It did little damage to the north tower's structural         tube, other than the affected X-brace. Damage was         extensive to the other building systems, however, because         the bomb compromised major utility lines in the basement,         and the brace compromised the central core wall, allowing         soot and smoke to shoot up the building core (ENR 3/15/93         p. 12).
