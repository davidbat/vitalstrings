Planes Strike the Twin Towers
8:48 am: AA Flight 11 crashes into the North Tower.
On Tuesday, September 11, the two tallest buildings in New York — 110 stories each, a major tourist attraction, and crowded with men and women working for financial powerhouses, government agencies, restaurants, and shops — were destroyed.
