These buildings are all in use today:
 
• Caracas, Venezuela, Oct, 2004, 56 story building,
    burned for 17 hours over 26 floors
• Los Angeles, May 1988, 1st Interstate Bank, 62 stories,
    burned for 3.5 hours over 5 floors
• Philadelphia, Feb, 1991, Meridian Plaza, 38 stories,
    burned for 18 hours over 8 floors
• New York, Aug, 1970, New York Plaza, 50 stories,
    burned for six hours
 
Previously molten metal was found "flowing like lava" by the FDNY                      in the basements of all 3 WTC High-rises. Hydrocarbon fires can                      burn at a maximum temperature of 1,800°F which is about 1,000° short of the beginning melting temperature of steel. Where did the                      molten metal come from? Why do FEMA and NIST deny its existence?
The 4- to 20-ton steel columns & beams were broken apart at bolted and welded                      connections and ejected laterally up to 500 feet.
 
The architectural drawings of the WTC North Tower have been leaked                      from an individual associated with the Silverstein-Weidlinger                      Report. They reveal that the large box columns of the core                      maintain their 30"x16" and 52"x22" dimensions at least up                      through the 66th floor. They also indicate that most of the                      core columns would be easily accessed from the elevator shafts                      in order to plant explosives. We know that the elevators were                      being modernized by Ace Elevator during the 9 months prior to 9/11.
 
This is the World Trade Center exploding.
This is an acknowledged explosion.
Can you tell the difference?
 
Which 20 story building will fall to the ground first? Until                      9/11/01 most physicists would have agreed that the one that                      didn't have to crush though 100,000 tons of steel would fall                      first — at free-fall speed. On 9/11, the example on the left                      "collapsed" at virtually free-fall speed! But this could only                      have been accomplished by removing the columns ahead of the                      fall — with explosives.
Numerous Squibs (mis-timed explosions) can be seen seen 20 to 40                      floors ahead of the advancing "collapse". NIST claims that                      they are "puffs of air" created from the pancaking floors above.                      But there are no pancaking floors above, they are not air but                      pulverized building materials, they occur precisely at the                      center of the building in an "open office plan", and finally,                      the 160 to 200 feet per second speed of this debris suggests they                      could only have been propelled by explosives.
 
The debris was equally distributed across a 1,400 ft. diameter. There                      are no "pancakes" stacked up at the bottom of either tower!
 
The FEMA report notes:
"The results of the examination are striking. They reveal a                      phenomenon never before observed in building fires: eutectic                      reactions, which caused "intergranular melting capable of                      turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.... Evidence                      of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel,                      including oxidation and sulfidation." NIST dropped this like a                      hot potato. These are all tell tell signs of the use of                      thermate (sulphur + thermite) incendiary cutter charges."
It takes thousands of degrees to bend steel like this without                      buckling. Thermate cutter charges create over 4,500°F.                      Fires — even with jet fuel — create only 1,700°F maximum.
 
Physics professor Steven Jones finds, in this previously molten                      sample from the WTC, the chemical traces of Thermate — including Fluorine, Manganese, Sulphur, Potassium, etc.
Steven Jones, PhD physicist discovers previously molten iron                      spheres in the WTC dust which blanketed lower Manhattan. Sizes                      are up to 1/16" diameter. The findings are corroborated by                      EPA but not explained. Molten iron is the byproduct of                      Thermite. It contains the chemical signature of thermate.
 
The Smoking Gun: Microspheres carry signature of Thermate!
 
The concrete and other building contents were pulverized to a thick                      ground hugging pyroclastic dust — much of which was <100                      microns — the width of a human hair. The gravitational potential of                      the building at 100,000KWH does not account for the concrete pulverization                      or the rapid expansion of the dust clouds.
This is all that is left of the concrete floors, gypsum wall board,                      steel decking, office furniture, office machinery, filing                      cabinets. The toxic dust averages 4" deep — throughout lower Manhattan.
 
Controlled demolitions can be performed in a variety of ways.
Above are two examples of top-down controlled demolition.
 
Why didn't we see the truth about about 9/11 before?
Did the 9/11 Commission keep the true cause of the "collapses" under wraps?
Did FEMA and NIST lie in their reports?
Is the mainstream media controlled enough to manipulate this story from the very beginning?
WE WILL ONLY KNOW IF WE GET A NEW TRULY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION!
