Little Did She Know..
"I don't have a lot of money to donate but I have made this tribute in honor of the 3rd month since Sept. 11th, 2001. I feel this will give comfort to alot of people and it already has but I wanted you to see it too. Grab some tissues before you view it you may need them."
The Men Who Went Up Instead Of Coming Down
"A couple of days ago, someone said to me, "Why are they giving more credit to the firemen and police officers who died?.. My immediate response was "because they were the ones going up, instead of coming down!"... so I have written a small tribute to the men and women who sacrificed their lives in an attempt to save others."
