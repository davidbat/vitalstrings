"By this September, 9/11 will be eleven years ago. Yet          despite the War on Terror, the loss of Americans' privacy          and civil liberties, an expenditure of trillions of dollars          on numerous wars, violations of US and international laws          against torture, and so forth, no one has been held          accountable. Neither the perpetrators nor those whom the          perpetrators outwitted, assuming that they are different          people, have been held accountable. Going on 11 years and no          trials of villains or chastisement of negligent public          officials. This is remarkable."

Help Understanding the planned          Destructions of the World Trade Center Twin Towers and          Debunking the Conspiracy Theory of Prof. Bazant and NIST. It          is quite simple! A Structure cannot be one-way crushed-down          from above by a small Piece of itself driven by          Gravity
Most people lack direct or personal          information about structural damage analysis, and          they are often tempted to attribute structural damages to          some nefarious actor, e.g. a plane has just before hit the          top of the skyscraper WTC1 and put it on fire and the          skyscraper WTC1 suddenly collapses from top down, it is          believed that the plane and fire caused the collapse ...          from top ... down. Weak top crushes strong, intact bottom?          Is it really possible?

That a film of a plane colliding with          skyscraper WTC1 producing a fire ball and smoke cloud that          soon disappear and all films showing the same skyscraper          WTC1 on fire shown live on TV with smoke pouring out          are faked up computer graphic image animations cannot be          imagined. Fake news on TV! In the USA?
The wrong information is least likely to          be resisted if others believe, or are made believe, the same          thing. Bad information cascades arise through the same          processes that fuel many kinds of scientific errors. What          makes such cascades most distinctive is their          self-insulating quality. Engineers that believe that          structures collapse from top because they saw it on          television will not accept engineering principles to the          contrary - that it is impossible. They are stupid engineers.
The very engineering facts that might          dissolve bad information cascades can be taken as further          evidence on their behalf. Stupid people do not want to          listen to serious engineers.
Bad theories, e.g. that structures          collapses from top by gravity, create serious risks. They do          not merely undermine democratic debate; in extreme cases,          they create or fuel violence, like US military attacks on          Afghanistan and Iraq.
The US government is not interested to          dispel the 2001 bad information cascade that structures          collapse from top down by gravity due local failure up top.          So you have to read about it here.

Introduction
The WTC Towers could not have                   been one-way crushed down and destroyed by                   their small, light, weak upper                   parts C dropping down                   on the big, heavy stronger lower                   parts A becoming                   first rubble                   B and then two heaps                   of rubble on the ground zero on 9/11/2001 as shown right.
Reason is that "a smaller, upper part of                   an isotropic or composite 3-D structure, when                   dropped on and impacting a greater part of same                   structure by gravity, cannot one-way crush down the                   greater, lower part of the structure".
It is known as the Björkman axiom of                   structural damage analysis and applies to, e.g.                   planes flying into tops of skyscrapers.
Therefore the below report by the NYT on                   9/12/2001 is a fake:
 
Can hijacked jets making holes in the weak tops                   of towers, destroy the complete, much stronger                   towers below - from above - as shown right?
Or was the NYT publishing a lie? More                   faked photos were published by the NYT                   Staff ... and they got a prize!
According basic structural damage                   analysis no structure of any kind can destroy                   itself by its weak top dropping by gravity on its strong bottom that carries the top.
Why did a newspaper like the NYT suggest the                   contrary?
Watching                   TV ? It is very easy to                   fake a plane crashing into a                   skyscraper!
Like          this! It          is just a question of various layers on a video!  And          to add some scripted comments! It is like          composing music. But when a plane collides with a skyscraper          there should be plenty of plane parts bouncing off the          skyscraper ... but there were none! It is also easy to make          up crazy, stupid, false, faked up scientific theories, e.g.          that structures collapse from top by gravity, published by          terrorists like professor Z.          Bazant at Northwestern University.
However, the fact is that a tower          (a steel structure, A) cannot collapse or be destroyed from          above (!) and crushed down or compressed (!) by a small (!)          part (C) of itself, POUFF, POUFF, POUFF, POUFF, POUFF, POUFF          by gravity into rubble. Prove me wrong and win          €1 000 000:- .
This article describes in layman's terms and using          common sense (!) the structure of the World Trade          Center Twin Towers and what happens when the alleged release of potential          energy, due to downward, alleged free          fall* (!) movement and alleged impact (!) of the mass above          - a small top part lightweight structure (part C)          - by its supporting columns when buckling, exceeds          the strain energy that can be absorbed by the          same columns and much bigger structure below (part A). These          are the official, identical cause and effect of both destructions. The conclusion is that the official conclusions          by US authorities and experts are false! A          composite steel structure like the WTC towers cannot crush          down one-way from top down, when a small piece of the          structure - upper part          C - drops on the structure - intact part          A from above! One reason is that the          bottom part A of WTC1 is 10 times stronger than the top part          C. Another reason is that gravity provides too little energy          to destroy the structure. Quite basic! The USA is fooling          the world.

The picture (from a video) has been                   made using 'Independence Day' film technology -                   smoke, dust and debris are just added, while bits                   of the tower are erased. Big parts dropping from                   skyskraper = ridiculous! Prove me wrong and win Euro                   1. 000 000:- (Note - photo is a fake!)
Björkman's famous axiom regarding any                   structure says:
A smaller (weaker) top part of an                            isotropic or composite 3-D structure, when                            dropped on and impacting a greater                            (stronger) bottom part of same structure                            by gravity, cannot one-way crush down the                            greater bottom part of the                            structure.
It means that you cannot one-way crush an isotropic                   or composite structure A by a part C of itself (say                   C = 1/10 A) by dropping small part C on big part A                   using gravity. Part C either bounces on A or gets                   damaged in contact with A and is stopped by A that                   is also damaged a little by C. It is quite basic                   and all due to forces and deformations absorbing                   energy and the fact that both parts have same structure and that the weakest elements                   in both parts fail first. Materials and particulars                   of the elements of the structure A doesn't matter                   the least as long as they are same as structure                   C.
Thus no structures, 1, 2 or 5 meters tall, or                   100, 200 or 500 meters tall exist (e.g. the one                   shown right) that will one-way crush down, when a                   small part C is dropped on the bigger part A                   below.
However, various people or fools, i.a. Bazant and Seffen , which will be                   further described below in 2.1 and 9.1 propose otherwise.                   They suggest that what they describe as crush                   down or progressive collapse takes place as                   follows:
The top part                   C of any structure gets loose, drops on                   and destroys bottom part                   A into rubble                   B!
After a few seconds the whole building A is                   just rubbleB!                   The basic errors with these suggestions are simply                   that no small top part C can ever destroy anything                   below it that carried it before.
The WTC 1 collapse can be seen here ! The video is fake, manufactured Hollywood                   Dreamwork Disney style, as no structure can                   collapse from top down. Actually all videos and                   pictures on TV, incl. the one above, showing the                   destructions of the WTC towers are faked! The real                   terrorists faked all videos. Imagine                   that!
It is quite simple to learn what happens at                   impacts of a mass above and why                   Björkman's axiom always apply! Just                   drop any mass above on something below! Start with a solid rubber ball and drop                   it on the floor. The ball/mass                   above normally bounces.
The ball was not rigid and deformed upon                   contact with the floor. Why? The floor applied a force on the solid rubber                   ball, so that it deformed, absorbed some of the                   kinetic energy involved and then released it and                   bounced up.
Fig. S2 - A building                   A with                   a top part C becomes rubble B due to                   progressive collapse and crush down of A by C                   according to false theories of Bazant and Seffen                   developed after 11 September 2001. Evidently a                   small top                   part C cannot                   crush a bigger bottom part A of same, stronger                   structure only due to                   gravity!
Evidently the ball also applied a force on the floor that also                   deformed, absorbed the remainder of the                   energy involved; maybe the floor                   vibrated a little. This is Newton's third law at                   work.
Then do the same thing with a solid sphere of                   steel. Drop it on the floor. If the floor is strong                   enough, the same thing will happen as with a rubber                   ball! The steel sphere bounces. If the floor is not                   strong enough, i.e. it cannot produce a force big                   enough to deform the steel sphere, so that it                   bounces back, the floor will be damaged - maybe a                   hole is formed in it, and the steel sphere drops                   through the hole, or the floor is just partially                   damaged ... and catches the steel ball, i.e. arrests it.
Now you have learnt a little what can happen                   when you drop anything on anything. This basic                   knowledge is used in this presentation. Now try to                   drop a piece of something on the same something                   bigger. You can never one-way crush                   down something A by a top piece C of                   A!
The conclusion is that no destruction of                   the Towers can ensue under the given circumstances.
More info is available in booklet Best                   Practices for Reducing the Potential for                   Progressive Collapse in                   Buildings .
The reason is, apart from neither free                   fall nor impact of an upper part                   C or mass taking place - they                   are just invention by the terrorists - that the upper part                   C, with floor area 4 000                   m² and its columns, which only occupy 5-6                   m² or 0.13% of the total area, is not aligned                   with the lower structure and its columns at the                   alleged incidents/impacts! The upper and lower load                   bearing columns will never meet at any point!
Fig. S3 - Local failures                   to building (Ronan Point) initiated by failure (gas                   explosion) on 16 th floor causing first collapse of                   floors up to the roof (26th floor). Loose elements                   then overloaded the corner of the building below                   floor 16. Note that ground floor is undamaged/not                   crushed at all and that loose wall elements have                   taken the path of least resistance and fallen outside the tower, while the floor elements                   still hang on to intact parts. Evidently no 'crush down' progressive collapse à la 911 WTC took place!
The upper part          C in fact is an assembly of many weaker          parts (floors) that will simply be sliced apart by the lower          structure stronger columns (part A) and then be entangled          with and jammed there due to friction and the destruction          will be arrested. The upper part C cannot apply energy on the lower structure          as the energy will destroy C first. You will learn what a gravity driven          destruction (something stronger breaking          something weaker below) really is and why such event did not          take place at the WTCs! The subject has been analysed in          many articles on the Internet but you here find new          observations and explanations. The information is so simple          to grasp that no peer review of 'scientists' is required to          support it. There is no mystery about it. The terrorists do          not like that. Beware!
(* free fall is to be understod in this paper as a drop          due to gravity with little resistance, while the velocity          increases (acceleration))

The author is a structural engineer for Heiwa          Co albeit in the          shipbuilding and very big oil tankers sector but the          principles of structural design and analysis are the same.

1. 1 The Explanation - major Problems          - no Evidence of (1) Buckled Columns, (2) Free Fall, (3)          Impact and (4) Shock Wave or (5) Rigid Body of an Upper Part C or Mass
NIST ,          the US National          Institute of Support of Terrorism , at Washington,          DC, has explained the WTC 911 destructions.
From NIST report - NISTNCSTAR1-6D chapter 5.2 - we          learn:
"The aircraft impacted the north wall of WTC 1 at 8:46          a.m.  between Floor 93 and Floor 98.  The          subsequent fires weakened structural subsystems, including          the core columns, floors and exterior walls. The core          displaced downward  At 100 min (at 10:28:18), the          north, east, and west walls at Floor 98 carried 7 percent,          35 percent and 30 percent more gravity load loads  and          the south wall and the core carried about 7 percent and 20          percent less loads, respectively.,  At 10.28 a.m., 102          min after the aircraft impact, WTC 1 began to collapse.  The release of potential energy due to downward          movement of the building mass above the buckled columns (the upper part C) exceeded the strain energy that could be absorbed by the          structure (part A). Global collapse ensued."
From chapter 5.3 we learn:
"The aircraft  impacted the south wall of WTC 2          at 9.03 a.m.  between Floor 78 and Floor 84.  (9:59 am)  The release of potential energy due to          downward movement of the building mass above the buckled columns (the upper part C) exceeded the strain energy that could be absorbed by the          structure (part A). Global collapse ensued."
Note that the two Towers were destroyed for                   exactly the same cause: The release of potential                   energy, PE, due to downward movement of the                   building mass above the buckled columns (the upper part                   C) exceeded the strain energy, SEb,that could be absorbed by the                   structure (part A                   below). There is no mention of                   the local forces that develop at contact and will                   destroy the structures locally and arrest further                   destruction or whether upper part C can apply sufficient energy on A                   without destroying itself. Terrorists are simple                   people with stupid explanations.
Progressive collapse of a structure is always from          bottom up starting with removal or destruction of load          bearing primary elements at the bottom causing elements          above to displace down by gravity:
Source http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build07/PDF/b07008.pdf
Can removal or destruction (e.g. by fire) of load bearing          elements high up in a structure causing downward          displacement of elements above, up to the top of the          structure produce destruction of all intact elements and          connections below the initially destroyed elements? NIST          suggsts it is possible. Below is shown that it is not          possible. NIST is producing a fake report about          WTC 1/2.
1.1.1 What is a buckled          Column?
And how much energy or mass above is required to          buckle it?
If any column would fail due to buckling in turn caused          by heat/overload, you would expect the following to happen          to it, when a compressive load of the upper part is          applied:
A...............................................................;;;B.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;C.
D................................;;;;;........................E.
Fig. 1.1.1 Five steps of          buckling of a column due to compressive          load
First, A, a plastic hinge develops in the middle          of the compressed column due to lack of strain energy there,          then, B, two more plastic hinges develop above and          below the first hinge, then, C and D, the          column 'kneels' and finally, E, a severly          deformed part of the column may punch a hole in the floor          below it, while the solid mass above or force applied          is shifted sideways. All these deformations require energy          that is applied by the displacing mass above! The column          will never fracture in any location and it will nevel          rupture due to fractures at the hinges into several pieces,          i.e. it will always be connected, albeit very deformed. To suggest that 'buckling' of a column will result          in free fall of the load or mass it carries is not          correct! It is in fact absurd. As absurd to propose          that dropping a mass on a column, the column will buckle!          The dropped mass will just slide off before any buckling          takes place.
The above deformation also takes time and would be seen          on any video, if it took place! No buckled columns from          floors 93/98 of WTC 1 or floors 74/78 of WTC 2 have been          presented as evidence.
The major problem with the WTC 1 destruction is that the          terrorists suggest that the top part, the upper part of WTC 1          suddenly dropped at nearly free-fall as a rigid, solid mass, releasing potential          energy, PE, becoming kinetic energy, KE, due          to acceleration and transferring it into the non-rigid structure below at an impact at a rate that exceeded the below          structure's ability to absorb it, ignoring the simple          fact that the buckled columns and failures in between would          simply have stopped the vertical displacement.
The structure below lacked enough strain                   energy, SEb, we are told. There is no                   mention of the strain energy of the upper                   part above, SEa, because                   it is rigid and cannot absorb any                   strain energy as it already contains infinite                   strain energy, and the effects of friction between                   the upper                   part and the structure below. And                   there is no mention of the strain energy of the                   intermediate part - all the buckled columns                   there!
1.1.2 False          Assumptions
The NIST explanation makes several assumptions that are          easily shown to be unsupported (no evidence) or false or          very strange, typical terrorist behaviour:
When the rigid upper part 's support             was lost, it was lost all at once, in all the 280+             columns on an entire floor, and for the height of several             floors (No evidence or false! Upper part is not             rigid).
The bottom floor of the falling upper part was             stronger (??) than the top of the intact lower structure,             and underwent negligible deformation -because it was rigid! - while it crushed down the             lower structure, which had supported it for more than 20             years through several strong storms, i.e. the strain             energy of the upper block, SEa,             particularly its lowest floor, was very big or infinite             (due to assumed rigidity) (False).
The columns, also rigid, in the             falling upper part were in nearly perfect alignment with the non-rigid             columns in the structure below after failures (False -             see figure above).
Columns in the top of the intact lower structure             buckled in one or more entire floors at once due to lack             of strain energy in the structure below, SEb (False).
This buckling failed to absorb the kinetic energy of             the rigid upper part, so it             continued falling at nearly free-fall acceleration (No             evidence).
Friction between partly damaged and/or loose             parts is not existing or considered (Very strange).
This almost perfectly aligned impact and             energy-lossless buckling was repeated on every floor, all             the way down each tower, with additional destruction and             mass accelerations (concrete pulverization, high-speed             ejection of dust, and high-speed ejection of steel             pieces) occurring without slowing the descent of the             "falling upper part ". There is no friction between the loose             parts (False).
 These above initiating events and destructions are          not seen at WTC 1.
 
1.1.3 No Initiating Events recorded on          Video
All videos of the destruction show that the upper part in                   fact telescopes into or shortens itself for 2-4                   seconds, while the steel structure below is still                   intact! Thus - the upper                   part was not rigid as assumed later by NIST and supporting                   'experts'. WTC 1 will be analysed in detail                   below. WTC                   2 is similar. Here is a video analysis of what might have hit WTC 2 and it is not                   a plane! 40 minutes later WTC 2 is suddenly                   destroyed.
All videos show very strange destructions when                   smoke, dust and damaged pieces are being ejected. You should wonder if the destruction is real ...                   or the videos are faked! Reason to fake the                   videos is to manipulate the viewer and confuse any                   analysis. Photos here are from said videos. In                   author's opinion the videos are faked but can be                   used for analysis anyway.
The whole upper part                   C of WTC 2 just above floor 81 suddenly                   tips over, moves horizontally sideways and                   disappears soon after as shown on photos right                   (figs. 1.1.3.1,2), while the lower structure                   remains intact.To suggest that the upper part C is rigid, remains intact, drops vertically and is aligned with the lower                   structure columns and crushes down the                   floors/columns below poses a                   predicament.
It is quite clear that nothing drops on the                   right wall and floors of WTC 2 structure below the upper part C.                   But smoke, débris and dust are ejected ...                   for what reasons? Gravity contact? Nothing has                   impacted the right wall! On the other hand it                   seems that multiple, great explosions take place                   tipping and mowing the upper part C to the left while the top floors are                   destroyed! According Bazant and others upper part                   C is supposed to be intact and                   one-way crush down the tower below, but anybody can                   see on any video how upper part                   C is in fact destroyed first. Thus                   the planned demolition starts high up ... and                   continues below later.
No free fall of upper part                   C or impact occurs at WTC                   2 ... and cannot occur - and none are                   therefore recorded on any videos!
The force to shift the upper part C horizontally sideways must have                   been enormous and cannot have been provided by                   gravity - a downward force!
The pictures (figs. 1.1.3,4) below show the same                   thing from another angle and a few seconds                   later.
Fig. 1.1.3.1 - WTC 2                   just before upper                   part C is destroyed. Note                   that picture is a fake!
Fig. 1.1.3.2 - WTC 2                   while upper                   part C is being                   destroyed. Note that picture is a fake! The smoke                   ejections are just added for                   effect!
"Observation of the upper                   margin of the cloud of dust and smoke in the videos                   somehow makes the discusser conclude that the tower top motion is caused by                   "part C becoming shorter while part A remains                   intact." This is a delusion. Part A remaining intact would violate the                   principles of conservation of momentum and of                   energy. The writers' analysis of the initial                   two-way collapse shows that the columns of part C                   get plastically squashed by only 1% of their                   original length and afterward the collapse proceeds                   in a one-way crush-down mode (Bažant and Le                   2008)." Bazant & Co, July 2010 lying in Journal of                   Engineering Mechanics ! Evidently WTC 2                   floors above #81 are demolished                   = upper part                   C is destroyed first!
The corners and roof line of WTC 2 are indicated                   by green lines.                   Note the smoke ejected from the windows well below                   the tilting upper                   part in the left picture, where the                   structure is still intact and no local failures                   have occurred. Gravity alone cannot produce such                   effects! What you would expect at worst is a short                   vertical downward displacement of the non-rigid upper part and very little energy released, smoke                   just ejected from a very narrow strip of walls,                   then a physical contact between the upper part structure and the top floor of the structure below, local structural failures occuring in both                   the upper part structure, as it is not rigid, and the lower                   structure causing increasing friction between failed parts in contact, mainly floors - no rubble or smoke being produced -                   absorbing all energy released a moment before and                   an end of the local destruction up top after a few                   seconds! In serious ship collisions, with much more                   energy released than in the WTCs, this happens all                   the time. At WTC 2 the upper                   part disappers in a dust cloud before                   the lower structure is affected.

No building/structure can          collapse as shown by gravity alone. The top part C cannot crush the bottom part. It should remain stuck on top!          Big parts dropping from skyskraper = ridiculous! Prove me          wrong and win Euro          1. 000 000:- (Note - photos are all fakes! You should really wonder where          all faked photos and videos come          from).
1.1.4 Does Gravity destroy Steel          Structures?
Gravity is an ever present vertical force of          attraction between any two objects, e.g. all the parts of          the towers and the Earth. WTC 1 and 2 consisted of many          parts and, when WTC 1 and 2 were intact and all parts were          attached to each other, gravity resulted in low, safe          compressive stresses in the primary load bearing          columns that were less than 32% of the yield stress as will          be shown in 5.1 below. Evidently the          gravity forces were balanced by opposite reaction forces at          every point.
Evidently no parts or assemblies of WTC 1 or 2 were rigid. A rigid body is assumed          indestructible.
A floor is not a primary load bearing object. It just          transmits its weight to the primary load bearing elements          via connecting bolts. It will also be clarified in 5.1 below.
If you cut a primary load bearing vertical column          or allow it to fail/shear off in one location, it cannot          transmit any load and the stress in it at the cut becomes          zero. If you then cut the same object a bit away (it cannot          fail again!), the lose part will evidently drop out and fall          down. If it is located in the wall, it is likely it drops          down to the ground outside the structure. A core column may          fall on a floor or down a lift shaft.
1.1.5 Free Fall and Collision          Impact
In WTC 1 and 2 we are told that two times 230-240+          primary load bearing vertical columns simultaneously failed          in two locations (buckled) in an initiation zone due to fire          ... and disappeared allowing vertical free fall of          the upper parts. I do          not believe it, because it is crazy to suppose it and not          observed and contradicts all laws of physics, but let's          assume it anyway so this article can describe the          madness.
What happens then?
Well, if the upper          part above the initiation zone was then hanging          in a crane and slowly lowered down and placed on the lower          structure, the lower structure would evidently carry the upper part ... as          before. The columns would again be stressed to less than 32%          yield stress. This is normal practice in modern          shipbuilding; big blocks are positioned on structure below          and welded to it. If you drop a block on the structure          below, the block is sliced apart in the worst case or          bounces up or a combination of the two.
But there was no crane lowering the WTC upper parts like in a          shipyard!
We are told by NIST, and I repeat, that the upper part (it is          assumed a rigid (indestructible!), solid          mass with uniform density and big strain energy,          SEa keeping it together!):
(1) near free falls vertically             (there are no buckled columns below it) and
(2) impacts instantaneously on the             structure below, i.e. its columns, forces develop and
(3) causes a shock wave in the below             structure columns, the latter are overloaded and rupture in 1000's of pieces,             (it now the global collapse is starting), while
(4) the upper part remains intact during the complete destruction due             to big, SEa , i.e.             is not damaged by the reaction forces and energy             transmitted to it at impact (this amazing effect is due             to the upper part is             assumed being rigid!), and
(5) is compressing, crushing down the rubble             below and
(6) remains intact on top of the rubble             all the time until
(7) it self-destructs at the end of the             destruction of the structure below!
1.1.6 Upper          Part remains          intact?
These are very misty allegations - total inventions - by          a federal authority (albeit with terrorist ties). It is the          first time in history, when a smaller object - the light          weight, upper part,          actually a non-rigid, flexible steel          structure consisting of many smaller elements with very          small strain energy, SEa, - destroys the          bigger and stronger other object - the identical steel          structure below only with assistance of gravity. And none of          the (1) to (7) events in 1.1.5 is recorded on any video! On          all videos the upper          parts disappear early and the lower          structures are destroyed sequentially from the top by          something else than the upper          parts, while huge amounts of smoke, dust,          débris and rubble are ejected. Very strange          destructions, actually. Looks like controlled or planned          demolitions!
The upper                   parts of WTC 1, 2 are the problems for the terrorists. We are just told that                   they can destroy the building below. They are                   according Bazant / Seffen ,                   two scientists, findings of which will be further                   analyzed and debunked below, supposed to be rigid, stiff, solid, of uniform                   density, indestructible, with                   infinite strain energy, SEa , etc., in order to first near free                   fall vertically, then impact and finally drive two huge destructions of intact steel                   structures that have never been seen before and                   after 911.
The weights of these upper          parts were not massive! The weights just          compressed the structure below to less than 32% yield          stress. And the load bearing structure/columns below only          occupied 0.13% of the total foot print (WTC1 at the          initiation zone - the rest was air!), which is an indication          how strong the lower structure columns were! The available          strain energy, SEa, in the upper part holding it          together was locally exactly similar to the structure below          on a volume unit basis; bolted joints of floors to columns          and columns butt welded together and connected by spandrels          and beams. Most of the upper          part was air! Its strain energy was very limited;          it was not rigid. What you would expect          is that the upper part would be severely damaged at impact ... and that further          destruction would soon be arrested.
There was plenty of space/volume for other structure,          e.g. floors, to get entangled in, which is completely          ignored by the authorities. Early on the so called pan          cake theory was suggested - whole floors being          disconnected from columns and dropping down from the upper parts - but          it was soon abandoned. It was a ridiculous suggestion!          Floors dropping down from a rigid,          indestructible upper part !
So the upper          parts were neither rigid, stiff,          solid, of uniform density, indestructible nor with big strain          energy, SEa , as assumed by          the scientists.
NIST cannot then explain the WTC          lower structures total destructions except that potential          energy, PE = kinetic energy, KE (of upper part ) is          greater than the built in strain energy, SEb, (capacity to absorb energy) of structure below (NIST's law), that will also be          further described below. Complete terrorist nonsense as PE/KE of the upper          part has nothing to do with SEb of the structure below! NIST does not consider          that friction between partly damaged or loose parts          absorbs more energy than any strain energy absorbed          by intact structure in elastic and plastic deformation!
Bazant and Seffen came to assistance. But they assume          that the load bearing structure columns occupy 100% of the          total foot print due to uniform density of the upper part and          not only 0.13% due to local, concentrated strength. There is          no air in the Bazant/Seffen WTCs! They apparently assume          that SEa is greater than SEb that will be further explained below. SEa would in fact be infinite according to          Bazant/Seffen. The upper          part is assumed rigid.
They also assume that there are no space and volume          for entanglement of locally failed elements anywhere          and that collapse arrest may occur! Both ignores that friction develops between displaced elements and          absorbs huge amounts of potential energy released. Collapse          arrest will be defined and explained below in paras. 1.2,          1.3 and 1.5.
 
1.2 Missing Evidence - Why wasn't the upper          Part locally          damaged?
There are 1000's of photos of the destructions but          unfortunately some are missing, e.g. those during the 0.8 -          0.9 seconds, when the rigid,          indestructible upper          parts start to near free fall (1) 3.7          meters - all columns failed - and then collide/impact (2)          with the top elements of the structure below transmitting          the total upper part KE to these elements of the structure below - and          nothing to the upper          part itself. It is then that the clock of          collapse time should start and (3) the shock wave is          transmitted. It can evidently not be seen. No intact upper parts (4) are seen          during the destructions that followed. In the case of WTC2          the upper part explodes          outside the footprint of the tower. It was not very rigid!
But if there is no free fall and no impact and no sudden transmission of KE, then a gravity          driven destructions cannot even be initiated and no collapse          time clock will start. Any calculations about what happens          after the alleged impact and instantaneous          transmission of KE become then pretty          theoretical.
We are told that PE is released at (1) and becomes KE at (2). NIST suggests in its infamous 10 000 pages          report that the PE or KE (no calculations)          exceeded the total strain energy, SEb, of          the structure below (no calculations), or PE = KE > SEb, but it is nonsensical maxims employed by          savages! PE/KE and SEb have nothing to do with each other!
Nothing to do with each other? Exactly.
The PE/KE of the upper                   part must evidently be applied at a                   sudden IMPACT to the structure below, but gravity                   does not work like that for loose objects! If some                   PE/KE of the upper                   part is applied to the lower                   structure, you may, e.g. expect some local failures                   due to lack of local SEb as long                   as the load is applied. The load will then slip off                   due to the deformation and lack of friction. The                   SEb of the complete structure is                   something completely different. Then there is the                   lower structure itself - it can evidently destroy                   the upper                   part, if it gets loose. It happens                   when local SEb is bigger than local                   SEa.
The upper          part that allegedly became loose consists of 280+          vertical primary load bearing elements - the flexible          columns - holding it together. All the loads of the          masses above are only held by the columns. The upper part is not rigid!
In order for this upper          part, 4 000 m² floor area and a certain          height, with 280+ columns that occupy only 5-6 m² of it          (<0.13% of the foot print), to free fall, impact and overload the lower structure, it must be 100%          aligned with all 280+ columns below after failure.
And then, if the 280+ columns above touch the 280+          columns below at contact, they must not slip off! Otherwise          no KE will be transmitted! Each column is assumed to          have failed at two locations (buckled) and the intermediate          part has disappeared or is bent 180°.
Does anyone believe that the cross surfaces of the broken          parts are identical allowing a perfect fit at impact ... and overload? Try to hit a nail with another          nail and see what happens because each column has the          function of a nail hitting another nail!
Evidently, the upper          part columns were not 100% aligned at (1) with          the lower structure columns after buckling - we are told          that they were bent - and therefore they will miss the lower          structure columns at (2). But NIST assumes the contrary!
No impact, no shock wave! And therefore no          global collapse due to KE bigger than SEb.
If you argue that it was only the thin, lowest floor of          the upper part that          first impacted the thin, uppermost floor of the          structure below, you should know that the PE of the          lowest floor is negligible (5%) compared to the total PE of the upper block. The KE of the lowest          floor must then be transmitted, via the uppermost floor of          the lower structure (actually the bolts at the columns), to          the columns to affect the latter. You require local SEa for that (in the bolts)! A vertical          impact on a floor cannot be transmitted via the same          horizontal floor to the supporting columns and break the          latter. The bolted connections between the floor and the          column break first! And something else should happen, i.e.          the upper block would destroy itself due to small SEa. It is one reason for collapse          arrest. NIST apparently assumes that the bolts of the          upper block are super strong - rigid!,          while the bolts in the structure below are weak. Not very          logical! Typical terrorist behaviour!
 
1.3 What you would expect to          happen
If something falls it must go down freely.          No upper          parts are seen going down freely.          They disappear early in the action that follows! Or that          240-250+ columns suddenly fail (buckle) just prior that. And          then there are these mysterious impacts after falling          down 3.7 meters near free fall that are not          observed.
The columns occupy only 0.13% of the total cross area          and, if misaligned by say 10-40 mm, they will miss or slip          off the columns below = no impact. And if there is no          impact, there is no transmission of energy, KE, to          the structure below - only weak, thin horizontal floors          of upper part and          lower structure will be cut/punched/sliced by vertical,          strong columns that will remain virtually intact.
So let's assume the upper          part gets lose (A). It means that the          potential energy, PE, available in a one-story drop          was greater than the local strain energy to be overcome in          the initiation zone, i.e. crushing all columns there. It is          furthermore assumed that the compressive force, necessary          for a descent was available; otherwise the motion would not          start, i.e. no initiation. If these assumptions are not          fulfilled, the conclusion is that the motion will be          arrested already during the damage/buckling of columns of          the initiation zone and the building will stand.
What happens then? Let's assume that the upper part gets          misaligned (exaggerated in picture below) outside the lower          structure on two wall sides and inside on the two other wall          sides of the lower structure (B) and goes down          (C). Similar misalignment takes place at the core.          WTC 1 with the mast on the roof is used in this example. Not          all floors are shown. In WTC 2 the upper part tilted more          than 10° and moved a considerable distance sideways          before destruction and disappeared which has not been          explained. You need a horizontal force for that, which          gravity cannot provide.

Fig.          1.3.1 - Dropping an upper part on a lower part of same          structure
The upper part walls          columns (right in picture (C) above) misaligned on          the inside of the lower structure will now slice          through the first (red)          floor below the impact zone - the floor hinges down on the          (red) floor below -          while the upper part walls columns (left in picture (C) above) misaligned          on the outside will drop in the air and hit nothing! Actually only half the mass/walls of the upper part carried by the walls participate in the local failures that          follows and results in tilting of the upper part.
On the other hand the lower structure columns (left in          (C) above) on the inside of the upper part will slice          through the first          (green) floor of the upper part - and it          hinges down too on the          (red) floor below! You          do not need much energy for that. It is quite evident that          the upper part is not rigid as assumed by all experts at NIST          and elsewhere!
And the lower structure walls columns on the outside of the upper part (right in picture (C) above) will remain ...          intact!
Similar floor failures may occur at the core but there          the columns are fewer and spread around and interconnected          by horizontal beams to which the floors are bolted.
In (D) the upper          part right wall columns inside the lower          structure are assumed to have sliced three          (red) floors in the          lower structure and these floors have hinged down with two          (green) floors of the upper part that have          also been cut by the strong wall columns of the lower          structure inside the upper          part on top. Similar failures take place at the          core. Evidently this destruction pattern will tip the upper part against the          intact (right in (D) above) wall of the lower          structure and the upper          part will be jammed. The progressive local          collapses due to some loose loads is arrested mainly due to          friction between the many displaced parts, damaged or not. This more logical local collapse pattern is something          NIST never considers. If the collapse is not arrested          then, the upper part will disappear completely into the lower structure          (E) and the left wall of the upper block will fall          down in one piece to the ground! The upper part is sliced          apart due to small local SEa (and not          infinite SEa as assumed by NIST) and the          structure below is also locally damaged, i.e. its SEb is reduced. The upper          block green floors          however remain inside the top of the lower structure. This          destruction would not produce a lot of rubble, debris, dust          or smoke!
And we do not see that on any videos.
 
1.4 Why global Collapse will not occur          (in Layman's Terms)
What a reasonable person would expect after                   local failures at the initiation zone - even very                   serious ones - is that gravity would just slowly                   (no free fall) pull the upper                   part assembly down, some parts may                   contact each other and get damaged like in a soft                   collision by local forces, when plenty of energy is                   transformed into heat, and after that primary and                   secondary structure of upper                   part and parts of structure below                   would get entangled into one another and rub                   against each other. Friction develops and absorbs                   the remaining energy released. Some parts will fall                   down outside the building. This is the basic reason                   why a multi-parts steel structure does not ever                   globally collapse like a house of cards!
Or in other words:
There are many masses/elements that drop - connected to          one another one way or another by strain energy, SEa, forming an upper part. You cannot          simplify and say the upper          part is only one solid, rigid mass. There are four outer walls,          core columns, many floors, etc. Each part and its          connections to other parts make up the total strain energy, SEa, of the upper          part that is limited. Let's say that the numbers          of masses of the upper          part are n.
If these masses drop, their PE becomes KE.          Each mass, numbers 1 to n, has its own PE/KE due to gravity. And each mass starts at a different location          and will drop on a different location by gravity. What keeps          all these masses together is the strain energy, SEa, of the upper          part.
The lower structure of WTC 1 is fairly complex - 280+          columns, 94 floors, etc. It cannot be treated as one spring or a party balloon or similar. The columns only          occupy 0.13% of the total cross area of the tower. What          loads are applied on them at an impact? Probably none as          they are small and any load will slip off.
The uppermost floor of the lower structure thus occupy          99.87% of the cross area or foot print. What loads are put          on it and where and when? There are many masses, numbers 1          to n, dropping down. Which one will be applied first?          Right - the one that was closest above and will actually          contact something below.
The strength of the upper          part and lower intact structures (all          parts/connections, etc) are known. We know the various          loads, numbers 1 to n that are dropped on the          uppermost floor of the lower structure in a certain order          depending where they started from. It should be clear that          if a column impacts a floor, the column will only punch or          slice a hole in the floor.
1.5 Analysis of Collapse Initiation, Progressive          Collapse and Collapse Arrest - The Masses get entangled -          Friction Forces absorb the released Energy
In order to analyze the collapse initiation you          evidently apply the loads to the lower structure and the upper part and see what          happens! Does global collapse start or is it just local failures due to local forces and local collapse is arrested          by friction?
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;B ::::::::::::::::::::::;;;;;;C:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::D xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxE
Fig.          1.4.1 - Dropping an upper part on a lower part of same          structure
So we start with load number n = 1 - the one that is          applied first! This is a repeat of 1.3 above. The          analysis will be based on observations and using common          sense. What happens to the uppermost floor of the lower          structure being loaded by load n = 1? And where does load n          = 1 come from?
In (C) above it might be the wall columns and core          columns/horizontal core beams of the upper part that hit the          uppermost red floor of          the lower structure in certain locations. Any deformations?          Local failures? Is the poor floor still connected to the          280+ columns? Maybe it is only sliced locally and falls down          as shown. At every local failure potential energy is          consumed to overcome the strain energy holding the parts together. At every contact point between displaced parts          rubbing against one another there is friction that absorbs          huge amounts of energy released. The rubbing acts as an          effective brake!
Then we apply load number n = 2. This is the lowest green floor of the upper part that hits the          wall columns of the lower structure on the other side and          core columns/horizontal beams of the lower structure. The green floor of the upper part has no chance          here! It is sliced and drops down on the red floor below. It          seems the big load of the upper          part is only applied on the - weak - side of the          lower structure - only weak red floors in the way          there, while there is more opposition on the other side -          lower structure columns slicing up the green floors of the upper part.
Does anyone believe that the upper part will fall vertically - near free fall                   - as a rigid block under the shown                   circumstances - which is the fundamental assumption                   of Bazant and Seffen? According basic physical                   principles the upper block is subject to multiple                   structural failures at impact!
Progressive, local collapse due to loads n = 1          and 2 has however started! Thus we have to see what happens          at the next floors above and below applying all the n loads there in proper order.
The first collapsed, hinged floors above and below will          probably deflect many of the loads coming first and later          from above outside the structure or inwards, against each          other causing jamming, rubbing, friction and entanglement of          these loads/masses. Too complicated to calculate? Not          really . As long as you realize that it is not one,          solid, rigid mass (one PE/KE)          that impacts one structure below with one SE(?), you          will agree that the Bazant / Seffen / NIST simplifications described below are just irresponsible          nonsense.
The first loads/masses from above, i.e. columns of the upper part applied          on the uppermost floor will probably locally damage the          uppermost red floor of          the intact structure either at the boundaries or on the          floor itself. The horizontal floor then becomes sloping          in various locations and positions. It does not drop          flatly down as assumed by NIST. The first loads/masses will          then change direction from vertical to sideways due to the          sloping floor parts and be stopped, e.g. by rubbing against          the slooping floor and being entangled in the strong          vertical columns. Gravity works like that. Some loads may          drop further on the next floor, but the latter will          obviously resist or only fail locally, where the particular          loads/masses are applied!
The next loads/masses coming dropping from above, e.g.          the first green floor          will not hit the uppermost red floor, but something          else, i.e. the vertical columns of the lower structure and          the upper part. There is          a lot of damping, friction, etc. in this mess apart from          pure SE of the floors of both upper part and lower          structure resisting and deflecting the loading. Potential          energy released is consumed both as strain energy          (deformation of structure) and friction (rubbing between          displaced parts).
The second uppermost red floor of the          structure below - see (D) above - may also collapse,          similar to the uppermost floor, when the masses, i.e. the          columns above have dropped on the first load/mass/mess. Progressive, local collapse continues. The second red floor of the          structure below, now also sloping, will in turn deflect the          loads from above as the first. Then the second green floor of the upper part will be          damaged, when it drops on the columns below. After a while          the top part of the lower structure is completely jammed          with damaged floors of the upper          part and the lower structure sliced apart in          various locations. The remaining mass will then not do much          further harm. Some will drop down outside. The rest will          remain on top, as if lowered there by a crane. If the whole          upper block is sliced up by the lower structure (E)          before arrest (no friction!), the upper part outside walls          will drop down on the outside but all the upper part (green) floors will          remain up top jammed in the lower structure.
The collapse is arrested! Reason is mainly the          friction that develops between displaced components but also          that the available strain energy, SEa, of          the upper part was much less than the available strain energy of the          structure below, SEb, and that 50% of the PE/KE released was in fact absorbed by SEa of the upper          part and friction there and the other 50% by SEb of the structure below and friction          there at the collision and following local destructions.          This is the beauty of an airy tower steel structure of non          uniform density with a strong perimeter held by spandrels.          Some local parts my fail (e.g. floors) due to gravity          overload and then any other loose parts just get deflected,          entangled and jammed due to friction in the mess, as          there is plenty of volume and intact structure for that. A stable state of a partially damaged structure always          develops. No global collapse will ensue. Collapse          arrest is when a stable state of a partially          damaged structure has developed. NIST in its 10 000 pages          report does not mention collapse arrest as a more          logical result of local failures and the report is thus          incomplete. That NIST ignores friction between          displaced parts after local failures as the main factor to          absorb released energy and arrest further destruction is          chocking!
 
1.6 What really          happened
So why did the columns of the lower structure blow up in          1 000's of pieces, if there were no impact and shock wave?          The answer will be given at the end of this presentaton.
The upper part it          seems to be destroyed before it reaches the steel structure          below ... at zero velocity ... and does not impact!          It is mostly air anyway! Let's call the upper part C and the          lower part A and the rubble between them part B. The          following photos extracted from a video show what          happens:
Upper part C dropping into          skyskraper = ridiculous! Prove me wrong and win Euro          1. 000 000:- (Note -          photos are fakes!)
Fig. 1.6.1 - WTC 1                   North wall just before upper                   part C above floor                   97 shortens itself or implodes. Note intact steel                   columns below the upper                   part C. No                   collapse or crush down of structure below                   has yet started there due to lack of strain                   energy ... and it will not take                   place!.
Fig. 1.6.2 -                   WTC 1 when upper                   part C has                   shortened itself or imploded 15 meters                   after about 2 seconds of                   roof line dropping. Lower part A has not been                   crushed down 15 meters and no 4 meters rubble layer part B is visible. Lower Part A still extends                   to the red                   line.
Fig. 1.6.3 -                   WTC 1 when upper                   part C has                   shortened itself or imploded 35 meters                   after about 3.1 seconds                   of roof line dropping. If upper                   part C would have                   been intact, it would extend down to the 9 meters                   thick rubble part B. Lower Part                   A still extends to the red line. No                   collapse/crush down of lower part A below                   has started and there is no rubble part B. Soon after                   the upper                   part C disappers                   completely in a cloud of smoke and rubble!
What we are really seeing on above three pictures is local destruction of both part A and upper part C at          interface C/A and not a one-way crush down of part A by an          intact upper part          C. Attention though - the pictures are from a          fake video!
The destruction of the upper          part C - it is compressed 20-35 meters          - before its columns reach or, as suggested, impinge on the          intact columns of the structure below simply means that the upper part C is not          rigid and that its potential energy is split in 1000's of          small parts and that the upper columns cannot impact on the          columns of the solid intact tower steel structure below and          destroy the latter. It seems that the upper part C consumes its strain energy SEa holding          it together prior any destruction below. It also confuses          the total destruction time of WTC 1! When does the          WTC 1 destruction actually start? When the roof (and mast on          top) starts to displace downwards? At that time no visible          damages are seen at floor 94, so you should wonder why the          roof moves at all. One second later? The roof has dropped a          couple of meters and still no impact and damages are seen at          floor 94. Two seconds later. The roof has dropped 10 meters          and still no damages are seen at floor 94. Three seconds          later. The roof has dropped 20-35 meters and still no          damages are seen at floor 94! The columns are still intact          at floor 94. There is no free fall or impact!
It would appear that NIST, the US authority responsible          for analyzing the collapse has abandoned the original          suggestion of a rigid upper part          C free falling, impacting and causing a shock          wave and instead suggests that 6-11 lower floors inside the upper part C suddenly          dropped down and overloaded the uppermost floor of the          structure below. The above pictures evidently do not support          such modified claim, where it is seen that the roof          displaces 20-35 metres, while there is no visible effects at          and below the initiation/impact zone at floor 94 (where the          floors of the upper part          C are supposed to drop down). If only internal          floors suddenly dropped down, evidently the roof would          remain in position. It would appear that the core columns of          the upper part C above          the initiation zone fail first, the upper part C is          compacted and the walls of the upper part C telescopes          into themselves. That the upper          part C does not remain intact should be obvious          to anybody. However, a few days later an unknown professor          announced exactly the opposite!
 
2.1 The          false Theory and the misleading          Assumptions
An American professor Z P Bazant published two days          after the WTC destructions 911 a theory that was adopted by the authorities as true. The Bazant          analysis is that if prolonged heating caused the          majority of columns of a single floor to lose their load          carrying capacity, the whole tower is doomed. Bazant          suggests that upper part          C then one way crushes down the tower in five          stages as illustrated by Fig. 2.1.1 below from the Bazant          paper! Upper part C remains intact all the time! The WTC 1          collapse can be seen here !          Compare it with the following:
Stage 1: The conflagration, caused by                   the aircraft fuel spilled into the structure,                   causes the steel of the columns to be exposed to                   sustained temperatures apparently (sic) exceeding                   800° C.
Stage 2: At such temperatures,                   structural steel suffers a decrease of yield                   strength ... This leads to creep buckling of                   columns which consequently lose (sic) their                   load carrying capacity!
Stage 3 (Crush-down starts): Once more                   than half of the columns in the critical floor (floors 94-95 of WTC1) that is heated most suffer buckling, the weight of the upper                   part of the structure above this                   floor can no longer be                   supported, and so the upper                   part starts falling down onto the lower part                   below the critical                   floor (floor 95 of                   WTC1), gathering speed (sic) until it impacts (sic) the lower part (floor 94 of                   WTC1).

At that moment, the upper part has acquired an enormous (sic) kinetic          energy and a significant (sic) downward          velocity.
Note the emotional words used and that upper part C is assumed          intact and aligned with the structure below.
Stage 4: The vertical          impact of the          mass of the upper          part C onto the lower part applies enormous (sic) vertical dynamic load on the underlying          structure, far exceeding its          load capacity (sic), even          though it is not heated.
Note that upper part          C is still assumed intact and aligned with the structure below.          Evidently not seen on the video pictures above, where          nothing happens there, while the upper part C is          compressed.
Stage 5: This causes failure of an underlying          multifloor segment of the tower, in which          the failure of the connections of the floor-carrying trusses          to the columns is either accompanied or quickly followed by buckling of the core columns and overall buckling of the framed tube (i.e. the wall columns),          with the buckles probably (sic) spanning the          height of many floors, and the upper part          possibly getting wedged inside an emptied lower part of the          framed tube! The buckling is initially plastic but quickly          leads to fracture in the plastic hinges.
Note that upper part          C is still assumed intact and aligned with the          structure below.
Stage 6 (Collapse): The part of building lying          beneath is then impacted          again (sic) by an          even larger (sic) mass falling with a greater (sic) velocity and the series of          impacts (sic) and          failures then proceeds all the way down.
Are any further impacts seen on of the videos? The upper part must then          still be assumed intact and aligned with the structure below          all the time to end of collapse. The extra mass below is all          rubble! Can it really impact again?
Most assumptions and conclusions in stages 1-5 are not          correct and the Bazant dramatic stage 6 is not possible.
Stage 7: Upper          part is destroyed in a crush-up by rubble below!
Stage 8: Rubble finally spreads          out on ground. More ...
There is no time table in the Bazant analysis and no explanations why the roof drops and the uppermost part of          WTC1 above floor 100 disintegrates 3 seconds before Stage          3, floor 95 hitting floor 94, is supposed to take place,          the latter never seen on any videos. To assume that the upper part C is intact          and aligned with the structure below during the complete          collapse is not serious.
Actually, the upper part , intact, rigid and of uniform density at start          of collapse, should according to Bazant's theory remain          INTACT after the global collapse at end of Stage 6 ... on          top of all rubble the upper part          C has produced of the lower structure. Nothing          could destroy a rigid upper part          C of uniform density - not even the final impact          with the ground forgetting that the rubble is there to          dampen the final impact. The lack of the upper part C on          top of the rubble after collapse proves Bazant          wrong.
It will be shown in this article that most assumptions          and conclusions in stages 1-5 are not correct and that the          Bazant stage 6 is not possible. To assume that the upper part is intact and          aligned with the structure below, during, ... and after! ...          the complete destruction of the bottom part is not serious. Actually, the whole theory of Bazant is nonsense! Bazant          treats the WTC-tower as a uniform line (!) that gets shorter          when impacted by a bit of the same line (the top of the          bulding) from above by gravity. But the line is not uniform!          It is 100 times stronger at the bottom than the top. The          small top would just bounce on the big bottom in a serious          analysis. Bazant is not serious! He supports the terrorists.          Strange world.
 
3.1 Tower          Structure - a Bird Cage
Fig. 3.2.1 - Outer wall mesh of          columns/spandrels like a bird cage
The structural design of the World          Trade Center Twin Towers is very simple as its very          lightweight steel framework is similar to a box shaped bird          cage in which human beings are working. Most skyscrapers or          office towers in the world are built according similar          principles. None has ever globally collapsed in seconds          before or after 911 except WTC 1, 2 and 7. More ...
 
4.1 Collapse          Scenario and Cause of Collapse - buckled Columns - Lack of          Evidence
From NIST report - NISTNCSTAR1-6D chapter 5.2 - we          learn:
"The aircraft impacted the north wall of WTC 1 at 8:46          a.m.  between Floor 93 and Floor 98.  The          subsequent fires weakened structural subsystems, including          the core columns, floors and exterior walls. The core          displaced downward  At 100 min (at 10:28:18), the          north, east, and west walls at Floor 98 carried 7 percent,          35 percent and 30 percent more gravity load loads  and          the south wall and the core carried about 7 percent and 20          percent less loads, respectively.,  At 10.28 a.m., 102          min after the aircraft impact, WTC1 began to collapse.  The release of potential energy due to downward          movement of the building mass above the buckled columns exceeded the strain          energy that could be absorbed by the structure. Global          collapse ensued."
From chapter 5.3 we learn:
"The aircraft  impacted the south wall of WTC 2          at 9.03 a.m.  between Floor 78 and Floor 84.  (9:59 am)  The release of potential energy due to          downward movement of the building mass above the buckled columns exceeded the strain          energy that could be absorbed by the structure. Global          collapse ensued."
Note that the two Towers collapsed for exactly the same          cause: The release of potential          energy due to downward          movement of the building mass          above the buckled columns exceeded the strain energy that could          be absorbed by the structure.
If the column does not deflect or crumple up, there is no          downward movement of the mass above and thus no release of          potential energy. And no impact! More ...
 
Let's look at WTC1 and floors 94-98 - the initiation          zone. Total area of each floor is about 4 000 m².
The total mass of the upper          part is as follows:
