The Twin Towers became an instant icon after their construction. They got sight from every field of life. The people of all races were attracted towards the World Trade Centre because of its expanses and beauty. Almost all the architectural critics condemned or dismissed them. The two towers were so big, so brash and so high, shattering the urban scale, overburdening the area. But New Yorkers accepted the twin towers large heartedly and like them as they felt their own enthusiasm in the huge towers. And after three historic events the twin towers became the center spot for all. The twin towers themselves entered into the plethora of “firsts”. They entered into the record book.
The first event occurred on April 7, 1974 when New Yorkers heard about a news that a boy named Phillipe Petit, a 24 years old French citizen, had successfully secured a tight rope between the towers. New Yorkers were amazed to hear that he successfully attempted this and made many successful carefree crossings. The police and public had felt anxiety but Phillipe did not.
The second event occurred a few months later on July 22, 1975 when a young man of age 24 named Owen Quinn made parachute jump from the North tower. Though the jump was full of dangers but he made this dramatic attempt. And after his attempt he was fined to discourage any other attempt like this.
The third event occurred on May 27, 1977 when George Willig, 27 years old made an attempt of crossing the world trade centre by using clamps on the facades. After three hours of continuous effort he made it and entered this attempt in the record book.
These were the three events after which The Twin Towers gained fame.
