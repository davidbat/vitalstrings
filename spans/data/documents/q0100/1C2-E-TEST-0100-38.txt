1.      The WTC opened in 1970 after 8 years of construction.
2.      The WTC was the dream of David Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase    Manhattan Bank, and Nelson Rockefeller, former Governor of New York.
3.      The Rockefellers wanted to name the towers after themselves, but the    mayor of NY, John Lindsay, insisted on the World Trade Center.
4.      The City chose to build the WTC instead of building a new tunnel and    large bridge over the Hudson River.
5.      The World Trade Center was designed by architect Minoura Yamasaki.
6.      According to Yamasaki, downtown Manhattan was the perfect place to    erect the towers because there wasn't "a single building worth saving in the eighborhood."

9.      More than 10,000 workers involved in building the complex.
10.  More than 60 of them died during construction.

12.  The WTC's foundations were laid at 60 feet    below ground level.
13.  The complex covered 16 acres when finished.
