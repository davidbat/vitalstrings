Model of Towers Is to Return to Ground Zero

Though these gleaming twin towers are a bit less than seven feet tall, they may be the largest detailed three-dimensional evocation of the World Trade Center that the 9/11 generation can pass on to the future.
So it seems fitting that this presentation model of the whole trade center complex, made by Minoru Yamasaki Associates, should end up in the collection of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center . The announcement was made Tuesday by the museum and the American Architectural Foundation , which has donated the model. The museum is to open in 2012.
“Architectural models are inherently fragile and challenging to maintain,” the museum’s chief curator, Jan S. Ramirez, said in a statement. “It is a double stroke of exceptional luck and far-sighted stewardship that this outstanding model has outlived the building complex it was created to forecast.”
When the model was on display at the Skyscraper Museum in 2004, it summoned — even at its 1:200 scale — something of the sensation of looking at the trade center , beginning with the fact that you had to crook your neck slightly to see the tops of the towers.
As you moved around the model, the towers changed; at one point divided by a column of light, then fused together, then looking like flat slabs, then like silver-edged pinnacles. You could begin to experience the interplay that gave them an undeniable drama on the skyline.
“This model has the unparalleled capacity to help tell the first chapter of the World Trade Center story,” said Joseph C. Daniels, the president of the memorial and museum.
