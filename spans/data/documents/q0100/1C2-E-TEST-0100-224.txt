i go with the taller twins. even though there are always the diehard skeptics out there who claim that the twins are unsafe and out of date, they are a lot more workable than the architecturally impractical freedom tower with its cable supports and off-centered spire. we can easily redesign the twins' structural systems without sacrificing their external looks. the freedom tower, on the other hand, would remain an unworkable vision unless real drastic changes are made to its structure.
