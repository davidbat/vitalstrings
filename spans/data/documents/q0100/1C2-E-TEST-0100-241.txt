Reportedly construction of the complex began in 1966 when the first concrete was poured into the trench for a telephone vault.
The gigantic office complex of never-before-seen proportions was created as a "catalyst" to revitalize Lower Manhattan and attract major companies back into Downtown.
The World Trade Center was more than its signature twin towers: it was a complex of seven buildings covering 16 acres, constructed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .
The World Trade Center was destroyed in large parts during the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the city.
The enormous complex removed from the street map several streets such as West Broadway, Greenwich and Fulton streets, and wiped out an entire neighborhood called "Radio Row", famous for its thrift stores for used electronics.
