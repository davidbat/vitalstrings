View from the Top of the Twin Towers
Video footage shot pre 9-11 shows a view of Lower Manhattan from above. This part of New York City looks much different today.
After the rescue and then clean-up phases at the World Trade Center site were complete the rebuilding phase began.  First to be rebuilt were the underground train tunnels to restore subway and other commuter services.  Following this phase the site was prepared to build a memorial and new structures to begin to occupy the site.
The Twin Towers were historically a landmark of interest for visitors to NYC. WTC site today continues to be a place with an intense draw and probably always will be.
