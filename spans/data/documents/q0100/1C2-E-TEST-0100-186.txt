Here is a replica of the World Trade Center. This is a memorial for all of the innocent people and brave firefighters that were killed during that horrible day of 9/11. The terrorist thought we would be scared. But no. We stood up and took action against them. Let us keep in our mind that our brave soldiers are out there fighting for our country. They have sacrificed they're life of safety here and have gone out to afganistan and iraq to protect us. Some have even made the ultimate sacrifice, dying for our country. Please think of what those brave people have done for us, and lastly GO USA!!!!!
NOTICE: I added download now, I have been very busy lately and have not gotten the chance to make the world trade center memorial hopefully I may finish it soon. Enjoy!
