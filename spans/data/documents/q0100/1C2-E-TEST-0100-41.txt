From my friend MBW, a high-school teacher: I am going to use this in my class on Friday. Our students don't have the background of 9/11. My students were in first or second grade when it happened. I think the clips were let them see how the WTC towers were significant symbols for our nation. This clip will be a positive lead in to our discussion. I didn't want to show only the tragic images. Thanks!

Inspired.  Thank you for making my day Dan.  The amount of work that must have gone into this is mindblowing.

Brilliant tribute to NYC and Twin Towers. Great job! But I do miss scene from mindblowing documentary "Man on Wire" ;-)

Well Done.  This is really awesome, glad it was compiled in one place.
I am a bit surprised you didnt include NYC scenes from beginning of New Jack City 1999, some of the best captures of NYC skyline I've seen in movies.  Also Spider Man (WTC in Spider Man's eyes and shown in some rare Trailers)....
I suppose not every scene could make the cut, but maybe if you do another version...
