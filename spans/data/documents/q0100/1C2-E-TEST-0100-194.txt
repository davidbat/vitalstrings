Named The Cloud, the luxury high rises would be located within the Yongsan Dreamhub project and would provide space for public and private gardens, green roofs, and other amenities for residents. Unfortunately the media has been focusing not on the towers' eco amenities but rather on their eerie resemblance to the former World Trade Center in NYC.
 
Located at the entrance of the Yongsan Dreamhub , designed by Daniel Liebskind , the Cloud will be a unique high rise in the new business district. The residential complex is formed out of two skyscrapers – one 260 meters tall tower and the other – 300 meters tall. Starting at the 27th floor is a 10-story tall pixelated cluster that serves as the “cloud”. This area provides space for an atrium, a wellness centre, a conference centre, a fitness studio, various pools, restaurants and cafes.
On top of the cluster is series of public and private outside spaces, patios, decks, gardens and pools. Special express elevators allow fast and direct access to the cloud.  Most towers feature a plinth located on the bottom floor, where most of the residential amenities are housed, but this tower moves those more private amenities to the middle. This frees up the ground floor for public space and gardens designed by Martha Schwartz . The Cloud offers luxury apartments ranging in size from 80m2 to 260m2 with penthouses occupying the floors above the cluster and townhouses on the floors below. Natural daylighting and cross ventilation play an important role in all of the apartments. Construction of the towers is expected to be completed by 2015.
Regarding the Cloud’s resemblance to the Twin Towers, MVRDV has issued a public apology and has expressed that they in no way meant for the design to look like the former WTC.
