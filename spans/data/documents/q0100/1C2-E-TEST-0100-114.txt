Michael Hingson and his seeing eye dog Roselle were on the 78th floor of Tower One the morning of 9/11. Once the first plane struck, the Yellow Labrador and her owner guided others down 1,463 stairs to exit the building.
Tower Two began to collapse shortly after Hingson reached ground level. According to Recycler.com :
"We were literally 100 yards from Tower Two when it collapsed," Hingson said. "We had to run for our lives and again, she just focused and did everything that she needed to do to guide us safely. And we survived."
Sadly, Roselle passed away earlier this year. But check out the video below to see her owner tell her amazing story at the Hero Dog Awards!
