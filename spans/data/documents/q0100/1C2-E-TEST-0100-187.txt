A picture is worth a thousand words. That can certainly be said of Denise Truscello’s striking images of her The Tribute in Light, views of where the World Trade Center Twin Towers once stood their last night 10 years ago, that she photographed last night in New York City.
Vegas DeLuxe thanks the many heroes of 9/11 and remembers the lives lost on that day a decade ago that lives in infamy. God bless each and every one of you.
Updated @8:28 p.m.: Truscello emailed Vegas DeLuxe more photographs from New York City.
“I photographed these tonight (9/11). I heard this is the last time they will be exhibiting The Tribute in Light. They usually display it one time a year on this date. The red, white and blue building that is partially finished is the Freedom Tower.
“Last night, I got lucky. They did a tryout for an hour, and I was lucky to be there to capture it.”
