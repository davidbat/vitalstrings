Brief History of the World Trade Center and Twin Towers

Admittedly, I'm a bit late in finding this, but I was intrigued when I found an article about the history of the World Trade Center on CNN.com.

April 4th, 2011 marked the 38th year since the World Trade Center first opened its doors. I was surprised to learn that the Twin Towers had only opened  38 years ago, as their symbolic significance (both pre and post 9/11) indicate a deeper history.
In the '40's and '50's, most of the economic growth in Manhattan was centralized in Midtown. David Rockefeller opened the doors to urban renewal on Lower Manhattan by suggesting the World Trade Center construction along the East River. On April 4th,1973, after 7 years of construction, the World Trade Center finally opened its doors, with each of the Twin Towers known as Building 1 and Building 2. At this time, the towers were the tallest structures in the world and the complex had its own zip code.
It's remarkable to me that something so relatively young could be so storied. Just amazing.Â
