You have to                 analyze the selected photo and put your attention on the details;                 the puzzle game will later display a section of the photo, and you                 have to put it back in place by clicking on the area (?) where it                 should go. If your choice is right the image section will remain;                 if your choice is wrong the jigsaw puzzle will continue displaying                 a new section.
