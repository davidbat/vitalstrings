The twin towers of the World Trade                                       Center were more than just buildings. They                                       were proof of New York's belief in itself.                                       Built at a time when New York's future was                                       cloudy, the towers restored confidence and                                       stopped the decline of lower Manhattan.                                       Brash, glitzy, and grand, they quickly                                       became symbols of New York.
 
Controversial                                       Beginnings 
The towers were not always popular. A                                       world trade center was first proposed in                                       1960 by the Downtown-Lower Manhattan                                       Development Association to revitalize                                       seedy "radio row," dominated by                                       electronic stores. Chase Manhattan Bank                                       Chairman David Rockefeller, founder of the                                       development association, and his brother,                                       Nelson, New York governor, pushed hard for                                       the project, insisting it would benefit                                       the entire city. 
In 1962, the Port Authority of New York                                       and New Jersey began plans to build the                                       center. Minoru Yamasaki and Associates of                                       Michigan, and Emery Roth & Sons, P.C.,                                       were hired as architects. Eventually,                                       Yamasaki decided on two huge towers.                                       Critics charged that a modern monolith                                       would rob New York of character, ruin the                                       skyline, disrupt television reception, and                                       strain city services.
However, the project was approved and                                       construction began in 1965. Five streets                                       were closed off and 164 buildings                                       demolished to create the 16-acre site.                                       Construction required the excavation of                                       more than 1.2 million cubic yards of earth                                       which created 23.5 acres of land along the                                       Hudson River, now Battery City Park, a                                       complex of four 60-story skyscrapers and                                       four apartment buildings. 
Building the World Trade Center took                                       200,000 tons of steel, 425,000 cubic yards                                       of concrete, 600,000 square feet of glass,                                       and 12,000 miles of electric cables. 
During peak construction periods, 3,500                                       people worked at the site. A total of                                       10,000 people worked on the towers; 60                                       died during its construction.

Instant Landmarks
The towers were dedicated in 1973. They                                       were the world's tallest buildings for                                       only a short time, since the Sears Tower                                       in Chicago was dedicated a month later.                                       However, the north tower sported a                                       360-foot television mast that allowed it                                       to technically remain the world's tallest                                       building. A hotel, a shopping plaza, and                                       three smaller buildings nearby completed the complex. 
The twin towers became the most popular                                       postcard image in the world. Some three                                       dozen movies were made at the towers,                                       including the 1976 remake of King Kong.
 
Thousands of Visitors
The buildings weighed more than 1.5                                       million tons and contained 198 miles of                                       heating ducts and 23,000 fluorescent light                                       bulbs. Each of the towers had 110 floors,                                       and each floor was roughly 50,000 square                                       feet large. Shopping malls with                                       restaurants, stores, and barbershops                                       dotted the concourses. The mall underneath                                       the towers contained another 75 stores.                                       The six basements also included two New                                       York subway stations and the PATH trains                                       to New Jersey used by 150,000 people                                       daily. 
Some 50,000 people worked in the                                       buildings, while another 200,000 visited                                       or passed through each day. The top floor observation deck had 26,000 visitors                                       daily, who could see for 45 miles on a                                       clear day. From the ground, the towers                                       were visible for at least 20 miles. 
The 43,600 windows were washed                                       automatically, while the air conditioning                                       system was the world's largest, with                                       60,000 tons of cooling capacity. It took                                       250,000 cans of paint each year to spruce                                       up the towers. 
Each tower had 97 elevators for passengers                                       and six for freight. Express elevators                                       zoomed skyward at 27 feet per second,                                       reaching the top in 4.8 minutes. More than                                       300 computer main frames in the towers                                       served the towers' occupants.
International Glamour
Most of the nearly 300 tenants were                                       blue-chip firms enjoying the prestige of                                       one of the world's most glamorous business                                       addresses. Eight law firms, six banks,                                       five stock brokerage houses, and three                                       insurance companies had their headquarters                                       in the twin towers. A number of foreign                                       firms, such as the Bank of Yokohama, also had offices there. The complex had its own                                       zip code, 10048. 
New York City 
In 1976, the elegant Windows on the                                       World restaurant opened at the top of the                                       north tower, followed by Cellar in the                                       Sky. The top floor restaurants attracted                                       such performers as Frank Sinatra, John                                       Lennon, Liza Minnelli, and Mick Jagger.                                       Far below, restaurants in the basement                                       concourse served 30,000 cups of coffee                                       each day, while 87 tons of food was                                       delivered to the towers daily.
 
Publicity Seekers                                       Attracted 
Before their collapse, 19 murders were                                       committed and 17 babies born in the                                       towers. They also contained nine chapels                                       representing six different faiths. 
As the towers became more famous, they                                       attracted daredevils. Three men parachuted                                       from the top, while one dozen mountain                                       climbers scaled the outside. In 1974 a                                       Frenchman walked a tightrope between the                                       towers. 
Previous                                       Bombing 
In 1993, terrorists drove a truck                                       packed with 1,100 pounds of explosives                                       into the basement parking garage at the                                       World Trade Center. Despite the size of                                       the blast, only six people were killed and                                       1,000 injured. After that bombing, the                                       number of parking spaces in the basement                                       garage was reduced from 1,000 to                                       600. 
Security in the buildings was                                       considerable. The lobby in each building                                       had 12 X-ray machines and 16 concierge                                       desks. The towers employed over 300                                       security personnel, used 300 security                                       cameras, and featured 828 emergency doors.
Buried Treasure
The basements of the World Trade Center                                       also contained vast vaults used by the                                       COMEX metals trading division of the New                                       York Mercantile Exchange. Some 3,800 gold                                       bars, weighing 12 tons and worth more than                                       $100 million, lie buried under the                                       mountains of rubble left after the attack.                                       Authorities say the gold has never been                                       safer.
Rebuilding                                       Plans 
In 1999, New York businessman Larry                                       Silverstein purchased the World Trade                                       Center's 99-year lease on the twin towers                                       for $3.2 billion from the Port Authority                                       of New York and New Jersey. Since the                                       attack, Silverstein has vowed to rebuild,                                       suggesting that four smaller towers is a                                       possibility.
