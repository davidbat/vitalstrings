World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition
  
 
"In its powerful, yet simple articulation of the footprints of the Twin           Towers, "Reflecting Absence" has made the voids left by the destruction the           primary symbols of our loss. It is a memorial that expresses both the           incalculable loss of life and its consoling renewal, a place where all of us           come together to remember from generation to generation."
- World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition Jury, from jury statement
World Trade Center Site Memorial designers Michael Arad and Peter           Walker presented the refined memorial design, Reflecting Absence, at a press           conference at Federal Hall on Wednesday, January 14, 2004.
