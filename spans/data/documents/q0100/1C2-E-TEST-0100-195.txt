9/11: How the twin towers were built
The 110-storey landmarks that dominated the Manhattan skyline for nearly 30 years were reduced to rubble in the 9/11 suicide attacks of 2001. Thousands of people in the World Trade Center, and on the planes that crashed into them, lost their lives.
Designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, the giant towers were conceived as part of an urban renewal project for Lower Manhattan - and when completed in the early 1970s, for a short time at least, were the world's tallest buildings.
Now - a decade since they were lost, and with new construction on the site well-advanced - take a look back at the life of New York's twin towers.
