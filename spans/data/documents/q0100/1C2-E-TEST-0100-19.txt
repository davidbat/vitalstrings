The World Trade Center was originally a complex of seven buildings in Lower                            Manhattan of which the Twin Towers were best known. They were destroyed by muslim terrorist attacks on September 11,                            2001.
The Twin Towers
The two towers were different in height, the first one,                            built in 1972 being 417 meter and the second one, finished                            on year later measured 415 meter. The One World Trade                            Center was the highest building in the world
World Trade Center
until                            1974, when the Sears Tower was                            built in Chicago . When                            destroyed, the Twin Towers still ranked in the top 10                            of the highest buildings in the world and dominated                            the skyline of lower Manhattan.
The Rockefellers
The World Trade center was a project started up in 1960                            by David Rockefeller. The towers were sometimes nicknamed                            David and Nelson, the Rockefeller brothers. The design                            came from Minoru Yamasaki and Emery Roth & Sons. The                            monolithic Twin Towers were never seen as great architecture,                            but it certainly was a great engineering feat.
The First Attack
The Building never received the attention the Empire                            State Building gets. But it first became world news                            when, on friday Feb. 23, 1993 at 12:18, a bomb exploded                            in the World Trade Center.

Muslim fundamentalists                            have been convicted for the bombing.
September 11, 2001
The                            second time the WTC became world news was on the tragic                            day September 11, 2001 when 2 hijacked planes crashed                            into the twin towers. Not much later, the towers imploded.                            More than 2800 People died in the cowardly terrorist attack by muslims. The site of the towers - a gaping wound - became known as 'ground zero'.
New WTC

construction
Plans to build a new WTC were launched shortly after the destruction of the original WTC Tower. Instead of rebuilding the twin towers, it was decided to create a memorial at the site and build five new towers around the memorial. Already in 2006 one of the towers - Seven WTC, a 52 story skyscraper - was completed. The whole complex, including the landmark WTC 1 tower with a symbolic height of 541 meters or 1,776 ft (The US declared its independence from the British in 1776) is expected to be completed in 2013.
Memorial
A memorial to the victims on the World Trade Center Memorial was unveiled September 11, 2011, at the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. The 6 acre (2,4 ha) memorial

plaza is built on top of a large transit hub to be completed in 2013. The hub is marked by a spectacular PATH entrance station created by the celebrated Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.
The memorial, dubbed 'Reflecting Absence', has cascading waterfalls with illuminated reflecting pools at the exact site of the former towers. The names of the 2977 people who died during the attacks that day (including those who died in Pennsylvania and Washington, DC) as well as the victims of the 1993 bombing are inscribed around the edge of the waterfalls. The memorial design by architect Michael Arad and landscape architect Peter Walker was chosen during a competition which attracted more than 5200 submissions.
