The slection of former US secretary-general Kofi Annan as the UN-Arab League joint special envoy on Syria – is another Zionist ploy to tighten screw on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s regime for the benefit of Israel. To build his unbaised credentials, Kofi’s first action was a meeting with Iran’s foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi in Geneva. During the meeting Kofi sought help from Salehi in his coming meeting with Syrian foreign minister Walid Muallem.
During his visit to Syria, Kofi Annan held talks both with Bashar al-Assad, government officials and the leaders of the western-supported opposition groups. It’s reported in Syrian press that he urged both sides to cease military confrontation to let his reproachment mission succeed. However, cease fire and a compromise between the government and opposition factions is not in the interests of USrael which wants to establish a pro-Israel regime in Damascus by all means.
Yesterday, Zionist mouthpiece, CNN, announced that President Assad had declined Annan’s settlement plan. However, as usual, CNN did not mention the details of the “settlement plan”.
It’s no secret that western imperial powers have used United Nations to wage wars for greed and Israel . Kofi Annan, himself has family connection to Zionist Jewry. His Swedish wife, Nane Annan has Jewish ancestry. Her mother Nina Logergren was a sister to the acclaimed Swedish diplomat from the industrialist and banking clan. Raoul Wallenberg, a man hailed in the Zionist Press for his actions in Hungary during the Second World War when he was supposed to have helped tens of thousands of Jews escaping the Nazis.
So, don’t expect any unbaised reporting on Syrian unrests from Kofi Annan.
