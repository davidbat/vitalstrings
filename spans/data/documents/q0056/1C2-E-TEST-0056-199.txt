Arab League Special Envoy for Syria, Kofi Annan, smiles at media representatives during a press conference on June 22, 2012, at the United Nations Office in Geneva. International envoy Kofi Annan on Friday urged the world to raise the level of pressure on Syria's rival sides and said Iran should have a role to play in the effort. There will only be results if the international community unites, said Annan, who fears that 'national initiatives' by some UN Security Council members were undermining its attempts to resolve the 15-month conflict.
