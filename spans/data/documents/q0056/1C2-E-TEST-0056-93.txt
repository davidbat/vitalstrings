Unless Mr.Annan has financial problems,it would be a big mistake to involve himself in the Arab mess. As a fact, Arabs have no respect for black people,including the Muslim ones.The late Gaddafi was hated by almost all Arabs simply because of his association with black Africans
If Mr.Annan wants to save his already soiled reputation,  he should avoid playing the role of reconciling the mad Arabs.
But since most Africans love money more than they love themselves and also they like to appease their former colonial masters,it is most likely that Annan will blindly allow himself to be used.

To Tom Sad, I agree with in the first part of your writing but disagreed with you when you said most African love money. Look the list of freedom fighters in Africa. The west has no blood without Africa resources. Look a country like France has no future without its colonies. They killed Lumunba, They killed, Sankara, They kept behind barre Mandela for three decades. They are keeping behind barre another African leader because the did not want to see them taking over the resources. I am talking about Laurent Gbagbo from Ivory Coast. My Friend Tom Sad, the Africans have been fighting the whit looters since slave time. Step by step we are winning the battle. Thanks God we are moving slowly by surely toward the freedom of that continent. In 10 years they will no longer going to be able to destroy any country around the globe. They are no longer the only almighty force that can destroy anyone. Most africans countries are trying to establish relation with China, Russia, Brazil, India. I said in 10 more years things will be different.
