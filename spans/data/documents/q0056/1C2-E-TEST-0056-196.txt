Situation in Syria is ‘unacceptable’ – Annan 25/04/2012 05:03 CET
Kofi Annan says the Syrian government has assured him it will respect the ceasefire with rebels, less than 24 hours before it is due to come into force.
The UN and Arab League’s envoy is in Iran, traditionally Syria’s ally. Tehran’s Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said Iran backed the peace plan.
Annan said his team had contacted all parties including the Syrian opposition.
“We have been in touch with them (the opposition), and have had positive answers from them, and I have also approached governments with influence to ensure that all parties will respect the ceasefire. If everyone respects it, I think by 6 o’clock on Thursday 12th we should see (a) much improved situation on the ground,” he told a news conference in Tehran.
On Tuesday, Kofi Annan visited refugee camps in Turkey, where thousands of Syrians have been fleeing as Damascus pursues its enemies to the country’s borders.
Despite the envoy’s optimism over a ceasefire, some observers argue that neither the Syrian government nor the rebels believe they have much to gain from downing their weapons.
