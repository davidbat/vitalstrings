Kofi Annan Warns against Military Intervention in Syria
After a closed-door briefing at the UN Security Council, Annan also warned against foreign military intervention in Syria, saying it would only bring about further bloodshed.
He suggested that an international contact group on Syria should be established.
The envoy added that the group should consist of regional and international countries, including Iran, which can play a role in ending the violence in Damascus.
While addressing the UN General Assembly earlier on Thursday, Annan admitted that his six-point peace plan had not been implemented by the Syrian government or the armed opposition.
He also pointed to the existence of evidence showing the involvement of a third party in the country’s ongoing crisis.
About two weeks ago, 108 people were killed in a massacre in the town of Houla, in the volatile central province of Homs.
Also on Wednesday in the central village of al-Qubeir in the Hama Province, a second massacre took place. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has put the civilian death toll at about 55, down from the foreign-based Syrian National Council’s claims of 100 dead.
Syria has rejected a report by the opposition council that alleges security forces killed dozens of people in Hama.
“What a few media have reported on what happened in al-Qubeir, in the Hama region, is completely false,” the Syrian government said in a televised statement on Thursday.
Many people, including members of the security forces, have been killed in the turmoil that began in Syria in March 2011.
The West and the Syrian opposition accuse the government of killing the protesters, but Damascus blames ”outlaws, saboteurs and armed terrorist groups” for the unrest, stating that it is being orchestrated from abroad.
