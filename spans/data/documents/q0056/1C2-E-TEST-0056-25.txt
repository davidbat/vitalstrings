Kofi Annan blames Syria for peace plan failure

Kofi Annan told UN Security Council members at a closed door meeting that more needs to be done to keep the Syrian conflict from escalating, sources say.
International envoy Kofi Annan blamed the failure of his peace plan primarily on the Syrian government Thursday and told the divided UN Security Council there must be "consequences" for those obstructing efforts to end the conflict.
Annan spoke amid more signs that diplomatic efforts to restore peace are floundering: UN observers came under fire Thursday as they tried to reach the site of the latest reported mass killing in Syria — about 80 people, including women and children who were shot or stabbed.
Annan said the time had come to step up the pressure to keep the violence from spiraling out of control. He urged the council to make clear that there will be "consequences" — usually a code words for sanctions -- if his six-point peace plan is not fully implemented.
The U.S. and its European allies have tried unsuccessfully for months to threaten sanctions against Syria as the death toll has risen. But Russia and China, Syria's main allies, vetoed two Security Council resolutions that threatened possible sanctions, and they indicated their continuing opposition in a joint statement after a summit in Beijing on Wednesday. The statement also opposed any outside military interference or forceful imposition of "regime change" in Syria.

Withdrawing the UN observers seems to be an admission of defeat and an abandonment of Syrians to their fate, but there don't seem to be any viable options. Since Russia and China agreed to the idea of the UN observers going into Syria, perhaps their withdrawal will have some effect on their positions.
