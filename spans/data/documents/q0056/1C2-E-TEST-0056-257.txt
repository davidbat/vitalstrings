Syria at ‘tipping point’ says Annan 30/05/2012 04:55 CET
The UN and Arab League’s envoy Kofi Annan is visiting Syrian refugees in southern Turkey, to see for himself some of the thousands sheltering in eight camps near the border.
Before the international mediator arrived, several refugees demonstrated, holding up banners about the need to stop the bloodshed.
With the deadlines for implementing his peace plan all but up, Annan is to send a letter to the UN Security Council later on Tuesday, according to his spokesman.
Damascus has said it wants guarantees from Annan that armed groups it says have been attacking its troops will commit to a ceasefire.
The UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees said today that more than 24,500 Syrians had taken refuge in Turkish camps, echoing the words of Turkey’s prime minister at the weekend.
