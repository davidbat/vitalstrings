Special Envoy for Syria
 
The United Nations and the League of Arab States appointed Kofi Annan as their Joint Special Envoy to help resolve the conflict in Syria. The former UN Secretary-General is working towards a peaceful, political solution to end the ongoing violence.
As part of a six-point proposal put forward by the Special Envoy, a ceasefire went into effect on 12 April 2012. The Security Council established the UN Supervision Mission in Syria ( UNSMIS ) on 21 April to monitor a cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties and to monitor and support the full implementation of the six-point proposal. On 16 June 2012, UNSMIS has suspended its activities owing to an intensification of armed violence across the country.
Special Envoy Annan's six-point proposal seeks to stop the violence and initiate an inclusive political dialogue to address the Syrian people's legitimate aspirations and concerns.  The plan also calls for access for humanitarian agencies, the release of detainees and respect for peaceful assembly and protest, as well as freedom of movement for journalists.
The Joint Special Envoy operates with support from the United Nations Department of Political Affairs .
