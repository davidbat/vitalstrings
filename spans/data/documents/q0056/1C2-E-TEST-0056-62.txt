Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan arrives in Syria in an attempt to end a bloody 14-month conflict in the pariah state.               Annan is acting as a peace envoy for the UN and the Arab League.               He called on Syrian officials to stopl fighting that's left thousands dead.               (SOUNDBITE) (English) UN-ARAB LEAGUE ENVOY KOFI ANNAN               "I urge the government to take bold steps to signal its intention to resolve this crisis peacefully."               Annan's arrival comes at an especially sensitive time.               Last week, 108 civilians were killed by what activists say was a brutal attack by government troops in the town of Houla.               (SOUNDBITE) (English) UN-ARAB LEAGUE ENVOY KOFI ANNAN               "The Security Council has requested the  United Nations to continue to investigate the attacks in Houla. Those responsible for these brutal crimes must be held to account."               Earlier this year, Annan helped negotiate a truce between rebels and the government of Bashar al-Assad.               But that ceasefire has proven shaky, and several cities continue to be wracked by violence.               Andrew Raven, Reuters
