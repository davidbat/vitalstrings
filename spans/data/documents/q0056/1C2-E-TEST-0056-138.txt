Hillary Clinton-Kofi Annan discuss Syria
Updated: 04:58, Saturday June 9, 2012
US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham  Clinton is meeting former UN chief Kofi Annan to discuss how to  salvage his faltering plan to end more than a year of deadly  violence in Syria.
Clinton is holding talks with Annan on Friday in Washington at  the State Department. They will explore ways to further pressure  Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime to comply with the plan or  find another way to stop the killing.
The meeting is being held after Syrian troops shelled a  rebel-held neighbourhood in the flashpoint central city of Homs.
Activists say the military appeared to be readying to storm the  area two days after reports of mass killing in the nearby province  of Hama, where about 80 people, including women and children, were  shot or stabbed.
