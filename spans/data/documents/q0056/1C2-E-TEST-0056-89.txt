As he began a visit to Syria on Monday Annan called the “tragic” massacre in the central town “an appalling moment with profound consequences”.
The former UN chief said those responsible must be held to account, and urged “everyone with a gun” to abide by his six-point blueprint to help end 15 months of bloodshed.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem met Annan and the head of the UN observer mission in Syria, Major General Robert Mood.
Muallem explained “the truth of what is happening in Syria and the attacks against law and order which are aimed at sowing chaos … (despite) the reforms that Syria has adopted in all areas,” the official SANA news agency reported.
World leaders have voiced outrage over the deaths of at least 108 people in the central town of Houla on Friday and Saturday, among them 49 children and 34 women, many blown to bits or shot dead at point blank range.
