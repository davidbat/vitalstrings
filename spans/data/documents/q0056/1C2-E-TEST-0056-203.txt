UN-Arab League Joint Special Envoy, Kofi Annan has left Syria for Jordan after a short visit. Annan met with President Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday to try to salvage what was left of a 6-week old peace plan, which has failed to stop any of the violence on the ground.
Following his meeting with Assad, Annan called on the government and "all government-backed militias" to stop military operations and show maximum restraint. He also called on the armed opposition to stop all violence. Before his departure, Annan briefly met with Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Miqdad in Damascus. He left in a UN vehicle convoy accompanied by al-Miqdad and Major General Robert Mood, head of the UN observer mission to Syria.
