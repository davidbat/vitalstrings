PhotoBlog: Evidence of bloody battle in Damascus as Annan calls for peace
Syria has told the U.N. it has begun withdrawals, but there were still reports of violence in the country – including attempts by the army to prevent civilians from escaping gunfire. In Damascus, fresh blood was visible on the streets.
A man calling himself Abu Mustafa, speaking from Zabadani near the Lebanon border, told Reuters: "They are complete liars, there is no army withdrawal, they are still in the middle of the city. They fired on the city this morning, like they do every day,"
However, he did acknowledge a pullback. "The army withdrew 15 tanks yesterday, but the rest are all around the checkpoints as usual," he said.
The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told msnbc.com in an email on Thursday afternoon that at least 33 people, including 14 soldiers, were killed in the past 24 hours.
Anita McNaught, reporter for Arab news channel Al Jazeera, reported from the Turkey-Syria border that families were still fleeing the country for their safety.
"The Syrian army is bombing all around the governates of Idlib and Aleppo," she said. "The way the Syrian army has positioned itself now is to cut off escape routes.”
In a report from Beirut, the BBC's Jim Muir said activists “are giving the clear impression that the Syrian regime is having a final crack at rebels before the ceasefire deadline”.
Reuters contributed to this report.
