Kofi Annan To Head U.N-Arab League Mission To Syria

Kofi Atta Annan
Kofi Atta Annan was the seventh Secretary General of the United Nations, serving from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2006. He was born in Ghana in 1938 and was the first African to head the U.N. In 2001, he and the United Nations were co-recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize for the founding of the Global AIDS and Health Fund. He was also somewhat controversial, choosing not to be sufficiently deferential to the West, condemning the invasion of Iraq as an illegal war and getting bogged down in a monetary scandal involving the “Oil for Food” program for Iraq. From time to time, Annan is called upon to act as an outside negotiator in crises. He helped end the violence in Kenya where 1,220 people were killed after a contested election in 2007.
Now. Annan has been asked by the United Nations and the Arab League to be their special envoy to Syria, to try to help end the appalling crackdown on dissidence that has killed upwards of 6,000 people so far.
In the joint announcement from U. N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Arab League leader Nabil Elaraby, it was explained that Annan will be operating within the framework of last week’s United Nations General Assembly resolution, which was crafted by the Arab League. It calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and the nation to transition to free elections and multiple political parties.
The statement said that Annan “will provide good offices aimed at bringing an end to all violence and human rights violations, and promoting a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis. He will consult broadly and engage with all relevant interlocutors within and outside Syria in order to end the violence and the humanitarian crisis. [Annan will also] facilitate a peaceful, Syrian-led and inclusive political solution that meets the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people through a comprehensive political dialogue between the Syrian government and the whole spectrum of the Syrian opposition.”
Maybe while he’s at it, the feisty Mr. Annan might drop a few hints to the Arab League about their little public relations problem. The Arab League initiated the intervention in Libya on the side of the rebellion. They have never condemned the movements in Tunisia and Egypt. But they have a little problem advocating democratic change in the region….too few of them are democracies. Leading by example is always a good idea.
