syria assad kofi annan
SYRIA is close to a civil war which could engulf the entire Middle East, United Nations officials warned yesterday.
As the full horror of the latest massacre emerged, UN envoy Kofi Annan, who is trying to get his peace plan put into action, said: “Syria is not Libya. It will not implode. It will explode and explode beyond its borders.”
UN observers found sickening scenes of destruction and bloodshed in the village of Qubair, where about 100 people are believed to have been killed.
Speaking at a UN Security Council meeting, Annan called for “consequences”, diplomatic code for sanctions, if the violence that has already killed 10,000 continues.
Later, as he arrived for talks with US secretary of state Hillary Clinton in Washington, Annan admitted: “Some say that the peace plan may be dead.”
