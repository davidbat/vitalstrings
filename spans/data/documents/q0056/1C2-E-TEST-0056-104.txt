BEIRUT (KABC) -- International envoy Kofi Annan is calling on world powers and other regional players, including Iran, to come up with a strategy to end the 15-month conflict in Syria.
Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron is also urging action from the international community against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime, following recent reports of attacks on civilians. The Syrian government claims terrorists are responsible for the attacks, not government forces.
