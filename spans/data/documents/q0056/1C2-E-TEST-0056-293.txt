GENEVA, June 11 (Reuters) - International mediator Kofi
Annan voiced deep concern on Monday at the latest violence in
Syria, citing shelling of the opposition stronghold of Homs and
reports of the use of mortar bombs, helicopters and tanks in
al-Haffa, near the coast.
"There are indications that a large number of civilians are
trapped in these towns," Annan's spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said in a
statement issued in Geneva.
