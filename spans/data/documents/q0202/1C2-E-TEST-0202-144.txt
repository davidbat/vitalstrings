This program is:  open
All applicants after May 1, 2007 must meet new requirements that include age, marital status, income, weight, medical history, criminal history, and others. A once stable and predictable program, China adoptions have become less predictable with regards to time frame. Potential adoptive parents must be between the ages of 30 and 50. However, if the potential adoptive parents are adopting a special needs child, they must be between the ages of 30 and 55.
Families who are in the waiting stages for a referral are seeing an increased wait time between acceptance into the program by the Chinese Government (commonly called "LID" or Log In Date) and referral assignment (commonly referred to as "LOI" or Letter of Intent).
