The reason we did not swap at the start was due to being scared of how the Euro's value would change, sure enough as soon as it was released it dropped 50% in a week. Smart choice to stay out!
Now the Euro has stableised it would be a good idea to change other, however, we British are very proud people and do not want to be apart of a United States of Europe and joining the Euro (or signing the European constitution in whatever form/name it takes) is considered as a step towards that.
