Most but not all
The Wikipedika article is quite good on this topic:
The euro ( currency sign : € ; banking code : EUR) is the official currency of the European states of Austria , Belgium , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Portugal , Slovenia and Spain - also known as the Eurozone - and is the single currency for more than 317 million people in Europe . Including areas using currencies pegged to the euro, the euro affects more than 480 million people worldwide, [1] with more than €610 billion in circulation as of December 2006. [2]
The euro is not the currency of the European Union as not all EU members have adopted the currency. While all nations which have recently joined the EU are pledged to adopt the euro in due course, the United Kingdom and Denmark are under no such obligation. [3] Several small European states ( The Vatican , Monaco and San Marino ), although not EU members, have adopted the euro due to currency unions with member states. Andorra , Montenegro and Kosovo have adopted the euro unilaterally.
 
They even provide a great map of the "Current Eurozone":
 
██ Eurozone countries ██ ERM II countries ██ other EU countries ██ unilaterally adopted euro
The entire article is worth reading. It'll be interesting to see if the U.K. ever adopts the Euro.
