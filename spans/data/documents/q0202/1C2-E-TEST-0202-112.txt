What to Expect When You Adopt A Dog
Bringing a dog into your family is a big decision, whether you buy a puppy from a (reputable) breeder, or go to your local shelter and pick a dog to adopt. Here is a list of things you should be ready to expect when you bring a shelter dog home:
Whining/barking
Your new dog has just come into a new environment, and is used to having lots of other dogs around her. She may spend the first few nights calling out to see if any other dogs answer, or call out to you because she is anxious. Although it is important not to give attention to a barking dog, you may want to avoid the scenario slightly by letting her sleep in a crate placed where she can see you for the first few nights and gradually move the crate to wherever you want her to spend her nights once she has gotten used to her new home.
Toilet Training Accidents
Even a housetrained dog may need a refresher course when introduced to a new home (this is also the case when you move house with an existing dog - all the strange smells can cause a temporary 'lapse'). Do not let your new dog have the run of the house straight away. This will help her tune in to her new surroundings.
Nervous Behavior
Are you spotting a theme here? Most of the issues your new dog will face will be due to a change in surroundings! The key is to give the dog a little time and not too much fuss at first. Shelters will usually suggest that you do not feed your dog for the first 24 hours after bringing her home to avoid her being sick or having diahorrea through the stress.
None of this information is here to scare you or put you off getting a shelter dog. You are still likely to have less problems bringing in a shelter dog than you are a puppy that has just been separated from her mom, brothers and sisters. Just be aware of what to expect and you will be fine
Adopting an Older Dog
It has it's advantages!
Deciding to adopt an older dog is likely to be a decision based on the lifestyle of you and your family. Giving a home to an older dog has many advantages to taking on a puppy. He may be more settled, already house trained, leash trained, and probably already spayed or neutered if it has come from a reputable shelter like Dogs Trust. However, there is still a great deal to consider before adopting an older dog, no matter where he comes from.
The first thing to research beforehand is the history of your potential new dog. Find out whether or not he was a stray (and, if so, where he was found). Older dogs are often calmer, having already gone through that mad period known as puppyhood! This will mean you can focus your efforts on more specific training methods when you take him home.
Next, find out why the older dog is now up for adoption. This makes a difference only if the dog has a violent background. It also makes a difference whether the violence was rooted in the dog's situation (eg, physical abuse or neglect) or if the dog simply possesses an aggressive dominance over his own environment. If your dog is going to be around children, it's extremely important that you know ahead of time how your dog acts when kids are about. The one thing you should always remember when searching for a dog to adopt is that most dogs in shelters are there through no fault of their own.
One factor that puts off potential owners from adopting an older dog is the potential health issues that come with age. Nowadays, this should not be a problem if you take on a dog with a "clean bill of health", as it will be really easy to get insurance against high vets bills. A big plus to taking on an older dog from Dog's Trust is that they will often contribute towards vet's bills for any pre-existing condition a dog may have, so that all dogs get a chance of ending their days with a loving family

Would you Rather Adopt a Puppy or Older Dog
Older Dog
KiwiGayle says:
There are already too many dogs so I would adopt an older dog rather than a puppy. The less people breeding indiscriminately the better. I'm involved in Rescue too and I've seen too many older dogs that have had long lives with too little quality in them.

I love puppies, but an older dog has a lot to offer. My dog Buddy was 18 months old when we adopted him. http://www.squidoo.com/election_dog The best part with an older dog is that you don't have to potty train him.
