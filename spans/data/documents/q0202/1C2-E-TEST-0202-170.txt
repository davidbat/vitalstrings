 
Do you have space for all these new additions?
In a word, yes! Our penguin enclosure can house many more birds than it currently holds, although Edinburgh Zoo Gentoo penguins are found in Zoological collections all over the world due to our success and reputation for breeding them.
 
The camera overlooks our gentoo penguin area. You may also see our king penguins! If you're a big fan of our penguins, you can even adopt one !
Please note that this camera does not have night vision capabilities. 
 
Now that you've seen them on camera, come to Edinburgh Zoo and experience these fascinating birds (and all of the other great Edinburgh Zoo attractions ) in person.
 
Our penguin enclosure will be the focus of an intensive maintenance and upgrade programme over the next two to three months. The existing pool has served our large colony of Kings, Gentoos and Rockhoppers extremely well for 20 years, and to ensure it continues to do so in the future we need to carry out this essential work. We apologise for any disappointment and we will re-launch our penguin cam as soon as the work has been completed.
