Changing lives one senior at a time
Welcome
HERE’S WHY YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE SO SPECIAL TO US…
I would like to tell you about Ms. Tommy Fields, an 89 year old senior with no family. Ms. Tommy’s husband was murdered in 1966 and she never remarried nor had any children. Ms. Tommy had been self-sufficient – even driving her car – until she fell in her home recently. She lay on the floor three days before a neighbor realized that her car had not moved and broke into Ms. Tommy’s home to get her help. Thankfully, although frail, Ms. Tommy is back home and recovering well.
Because her Social Worker was concerned that Ms. Tommy was alone, Adopt-A-Grandparent did for Ms. Tommy what we continue to do for so many other seniors living alone in Atlanta – we matched her with a caring adult volunteer (see photo) who visits weekly, makes regular phone calls, and takes her out into the community to enjoy life. This is what Adopt-A-Grandparent is all about and your contributions make this opportunity for “quality of life” possible for the elderly. We thank you so much for caring about this most forgotten population, and your tax deductible contributions are invaluable to our mission.
May God Bless You Richly,
Wendy Butts
