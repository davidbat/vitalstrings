Adoption InterLink UK Notes for Married Couples
ADOPTION INTERLINK UK
a note for married couples
There are no especial notes that apply particularly to married  couples except, perhaps, information regarding fertility and  fertility enhancing treatment.  This is a very sensitive area  and one that, if you don't already have adopted and/or biological  children within your family, you will be expected to address when  discussing your initial adoption plans with your Adoption Placement  Social Worker.
Adoption is not a cure nor can it necessarily alleviate the very  real feelings and, sometimes, sense of inadequacy that is aroused  when you find yourself unable to have your own genetic children. You can expect that your Adoption Placement Social Worker will want  to work through any such feelings with you.
What you can expect, of course(!), is that your Family will be just  that.. a REAL family.. warts and all.. a family that you will always  have known you will be yours.. probably for a long time before you  ever consciously thought about adoption..
..so..
continue working your way around Adoption InterLink UK's webiste for  the Adoption Circle - and explore all the many, varied facets that  are part of the Adoption Circle, your adopted child(ren to be), their  original birth families and birthparents, the social workers and,  above all, your own desire to bring together your Family.
Enjoy!
