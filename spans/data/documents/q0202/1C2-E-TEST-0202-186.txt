Finally, the doctor came in looking tired and somber. "I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news, he said as he surveyed the worried faces. The only hope left for your loved one at this time is a brain transplant. It's an experimental procedure, very risky, but it is the only hope. Insurance will cover the procedure, but you will have to pay for the BRAIN."The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news. After a time, someone asked, 'How much will a brain cost?' The doctor quickly responded, "$5,000 for a Democrat's brain; $200 for a Republican's brain." The moment turned awkward. Some of the Democrats actually had to 'try' to not smile, avoiding eye contact with the Republicans. A man unable to control his curiosity, finally blurted out the question everyone wanted to ask, "Why is the Democrats brain so much more than a Republicans brain?" The doctor smiled at the childish innocence and explained to the entire group, "It's just standard pricing procedure. We have to price the Republicans brains a lot lower because they've been used." ToothbrushesThe kids filed back into class Monday morning. They were very excited.Their weekend assignment was to sell something, then give atalk on productive salesmanship.Little Sally led off: "I sold girl scout cookies and I made $30," shesaid proudly, "My sales approach was to appeal to the customer's civilspirit and I credit that approach for my obvious success.""Very good," said the teacher.Little Jenny was next: "I sold magazines," she said, "I made $45 and Iexplained to everyone that magazines would keep them up on currentevents.""Very good, Jenny," said the teacher..Eventually, it was Little Johnny's turn. The teacher held her breath... Little Johnny walked to the front of the classroom and dumped a boxfull of cash on the teacher's desk."$2,467," he said."$2,467!" cried the teacher, "What in the world were you selling""Toothbrushes," said Little Johnny."Toothbrushes," echoed the teacher, "How could you possibly sell enoughtooth brushes to make that much money?""I found the busiest corner in town," said Little Johnny, "I set up aDip & Chip stand, I gave everybody who walked by a free sample."They all said the same thing, "Hey, this tastes like dog crap!"Then I would say, "It is dog crap. Wanna buy a toothbrush? I used thePresident Obama method of giving you something shitty, but looks good,for free, and then making you pay to get the bad taste out of yourmouth." Mohammad, an Arab child, entered his classroom on the first day of school in Ohio."What is your name?"  asked the teacher. "Mohammad" answered the kid.You are in America now. From now on your name will be Johnny," replied the teacher.In the evening, Mohammad returned home. "How was your day, Mohammad?" asked his mother."My name is not Mohammad. I m in America and now my name is Johnny.""Ah, are you ashamed of your name, are you trying to dishonor yourparents, your heritage, your religion? Shame on you!"  and she beathim. Then she called his father and he too beat him.The next day Mohammad returned to school.. When the teacher saw himwith all the bruises she asked, "What happened to you little Johnny"?"Well ma'am, 4 hours after becoming an American, I was attacked by Muslims."The Stimulus is Working!People should lighten up on President Obama. Just last month he got jobs for 63 Republicans!Call Me Senator- Video- hilariousActual Mug ShotsWhat do they have in common? Look at their shirts....Have you ever seen a mug shot of someone wearing a Bush t-shirt?...WHY I'M DEPRESSEDOver five thousand years ago, Moses said to the children of Israel , "Pick up your shovels, mount your asses and camels, and I will lead you to the Promised Land."Nearly 75 years ago, (when Welfare was introduced) Roosevelt said, "Lay down your shovels, sit on your asses, and light up a Camel, this is the Promised Land."Today, Obama has stolen your shovel, taxed your asses, raised the price of Camels and mortgaged the Promised Land!I was so depressed last night thinking about Health Care Plans, the economy, the wars, lost jobs, savings, Social Security, retirement funds, etc . . . I called a Suicide Hotline. I had to press 1 for English. I was then connected to a call center in Pakistan . I told them I was suicidal. They got excited and asked if I could drive a truck...... A nice, calm and respectable lady went into the pharmacy, walked up to the pharmacist, looked straight into his eyes, and said, "I would like to buy some cyanide.The pharmacist asked, "Why in the world do you need cyanide?"The lady replied, "I need it to poison my husband."The pharmacist's eyes got big and he explained, "Lord have mercy! I can't give you cyanide to kill your husband, that's against the law?I'll lose my license! They'll throw both of us in jail! All kinds of bad things will happen. Absolutely not! You CANNOT have any cyanide!"The lady reached into her purse and pulled out a picture of her husband in bed with the pharmacist's wife......The pharmacist looked at the picture and replied, "You didn't tell me you had a prescription."I took my dad to the mall the other day to buy some new shoes (he is 66).We decided to grab a bite at the food court.I noticed he was watching a teenager sitting next to him.The teenager had spiked hair in all different colours - green, red, orange, and blue.My dad kept staring at her.The teenager kept looking and would find my dad staring every time.When the teenager had had enough, she sarcastically asked: What's the matter old man, never done anything wild in your life?Knowing my Dad, I quickly swallowed my food so that I would not choke on his response; I knew he would have a good one! In classic style he responded without batting an eyelid  Got stoned once and screwed a peacock. I was just wondering if you were my daughter."Information about Gonorrhealectim The Center for Disease Control has issued a warning about a new virulent strain of this old disease. The disease is called Gonorrhea Lectim. It's pronounced "Gonna re-elect 'em," and it is a terrible obamanation. The disease is contracted through dangerous and high risk behavior involving putting your cranium up your rectum. Many victims contracted it in 2008...but now most people, after having been infected for the past 1-2 years, are starting to realize how destructive this sickness is. It's sad because Gonorrhea Lectim is easily cured with a new drug just coming on the market called Votemout. You take the first dose in 2010 and the second dose in 2012 and simply don't engage in such behavior again; otherwise, it could become permanent and eventually wipe out all life as we know it. Several states are already on top of this, like Virginia and New Jersey , and apparently now Massachusetts , with many more seeing the writing on the wall.Think about this: 1. Cows  2. The Constitution  3. The Ten Commandments ------------------------------------------------------------------------COWS Is it just me, or does anyone else find it amazing that during the mad cow epidemic our government could track a single cow, born in Canada almost three years ago, right to the stall where she slept in the state of Washington? And, they tracked her calves to their stalls. But they are unable to locate 11 million illegal aliens wandering around our country. Maybe we should give each of them a cow. ------------------------------------------------------------------------THE CONSTITUTION  They keep talking about drafting a Constitution for Iraq ... Why don't we just give them ours? It was written by a lot of really smart guys, it has worked for over 200 years, and we're not using it anymore. ------------------------------------------------------------------------THE 10 COMMANDMENTS The real reason that we can't have the Ten Commandments posted in a courthouse or Congress is this --you cannot post 'Thou Shalt Not Steal' 'Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery' and 'Thou Shall Not Lie' in a building full of politicians .... it creates a hostile work environment. A Russian arrives in New York City as a new immigrant to the United States . He stops the first person he sees walking down the street and says, "Thank you Mr. American for letting me into this country, giving me housing, food stamps, free medical care, and a free education!"The passerby says, "You are mistaken, I am a Mexican." The man goes on and encounters another passerby. "Thank you for having such a beautiful country here in America ."The person says, "I not American, I Vietnamese."The new arrival walks farther, and the next person he sees he stops, shakes his hand, and says, "Thank you for wonderful America !That person puts up his hand and says, "I am from Middle East . I am not American." He finally sees a nice lady and asks, "Are you an American?"She says, "No, I am from Africa ." Puzzled, he asks her, "Where are all the Americans?"The African lady checks her watch and says, "Probably at work." They walked in tandem, each of the ninety-two students filing into the already crowded auditorium. With their rich maroon gowns flowing... and the traditional caps, they looked almost... as grown up as they felt. Dads swallowed hard behind broad smiles, and Moms freely brushed away tears. This class would NOT pray during the commencements----not by choice, but because of a recent court ruling prohibiting it. The principal and several students were careful to stay within the guidelines allowed by the ruling. They gave inspirational and challenging speeches, but no one mentioned divine guidance and no one asked for blessings on the graduates or their families. The speeches were nice, but they were routine.....until the final speech received astanding ovation.A solitary student walked proudly to the microphone. He stood still and silent for just a moment, and then, it happened. All 92 students, every single one of them, suddenly SNEEZED!!!! The student on stage... simply looked at the audience and said,GOD BLESS YOUAnd he walked off stage... The audience exploded into applause. This graduating class had found a unique way to invoke God's blessing on their future with or without the court's approval. George Bush, Queen Elizabeth, and Vladimir Putin all die and go to hell. While there, they spy a red phone and ask what the phone is for. The devil tells them it is for calling back to Earth. Putin asks to call Russia and talks for 5 minutes. When he is finished the devil informs him that the cost is a million dollars, so Putin writes him a check. Next Queen Elizabeth calls England and talks for 30 minutes. When she is finished the devil informs her that the cost is 6 million dollars, so she writes him a check. Fi nally George Bush gets his turn and talks for 4 hours. When he is finished the devil informs him that the cost is $5.00. When Putin hears this he goes ballistic and asks the devil why Bush got to call the USA so cheaply. The devil smiles and replies: "Since Obama took over, the country has gone to hell, so it's a local call."Five surgeons from big cities are discussing who makes the best patients to operate on.The first surgeon, from New York , says, "I like to see accountants on my operating table because when you open them up, everything inside is numbered.."The second, from Chicago , responds, "Yeah, but you should try electricians! Everything inside them is color coded."The third surgeon, from Dallas , says, "No, I really think librarians are the best, everything inside them is in alphabetical order"The fourth surgeon, from Los Angeles chimes in: "You know, I like construction workers... Those guys always understand when you have a few parts left over."But the fifth surgeon, from Washington DC , shut them all up when he observed: "You're all wrong. Politicians are the easiest to operate on. There's no guts, no heart, no balls, no brains, and no spine. Plus, the head and the ass are interchangeable.Senator Harry Reid Buys a CarSen. Reid goes to a local GM dealer in Washington, D.C. with the intention of buying a brand new vehicle. Harry looks around and finds one he likes.After going back and forth with the salesman, Harry settles on a price of $45,000. Harry and the salesman go back to the office to complete the paperwork. Harry works out a 4-year payment plan, and signs on the bottom line.The salesman shakes Harry's hand and says, "Thanks Senator Reid, the car will be ready for pickup in 4 years."Harry says, "What are you talking about? Where are the keys to my new car?"The salesman replies, "No, you don't understand Senator. You make payments for 4 years... THEN we give you the car. You know, just like your health plan".Harry, with a choking voice, says to the salesman, "But that's not fair".And I say without any doubt or embarrassment: NO S__T!Get with the program Harry !!!!!!!!!!Short spelling lesson:The last four letters in American.... .....I CanThe last four letters in Republican.. .....I CanThe last four letters in Democrats... .....RatsEnd of LessonTest to follow in NovemberJones came into the office an hour late for the third time that week and found the boss waiting for him."What's the story this time, Jones?" he asked sarcastically. "Let's hear a good excuse for a change."Jones sighed, "Everything went wrong this morning, boss. The wife decided to drive me to the station. She got ready in ten minutes, but then the drawbridge got stuck. Rather than let you down, I swam across the river  look, my suit's still damp  ran out to the airport, got a ride on Mr. Thompson's helicopter, landed on top of Radio City Music Hall, and was carried here piggyback by one of the Rockettes.""You'll have to do better than that, Jones," said the boss, obviously disappointed. "No woman can get ready in ten minutes." A Republican, in a wheelchair, entered a restaurant one afternoon and asked thewaitress for a cup of coffee. The Republican looked across the restaurant andasked, "Is that Jesus sitting over there?"  The waitress nodded "yes," so the Republican requested that she give Jesus a cup of coffee, on him.  The next patron to come in was a Libertarian, with a hunched back. He shuffled over to a booth, painfully sat down, and asked the waitress for a cup of hot tea. He also glancedacross the restaurant and asked, "Is that Jesus, over there?"  The waitress nodded, so the Libertarian asked her to give Jesus a cup of hot tea, "Mytreat."  The third patron to come into the restaurant was a Democrat on crutches. He hobbled over to a booth, sat down and hollered, "Hey there honey! How's about gettin' me a cold mug of MillerLight?" He too looked across the restaurant and asked, "Isn't that God's boy over there?  The waitress nodded, so the Democrat directed her to give Jesus a cold beer. "On my bill," he said loudly.  As Jesus got up to leave, he passed by the Republican, touched him and said, "Foryour kindness, you are healed." The Republican felt the strength come back into his legs, got up, and danced a jig out the door.  Jesus passed by the Libertarian, touched him and said, "For your kindness, you are healed." The Libertarian felt his back straightening up and he raised his hands, praised the Lord, and did a series of back flips out the door.  Then, Jesus walked towards the Democrat, just smiling.  The Democrat jumped up and yelled, "Don't touch me ... I'm collecting disability."The World's Shortest Books:THINGS I DID TO DESERVE THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZEby Barack Obama____________ _________ _________ _________ _____OTHER BLACK PEOPLE I'VE MET WHILE YACHTINGby Tiger Woods____________ _________ _________ _________ _______THINGS I LOVE ABOUT MY COUNTRYby Jane Fonda & Cindy SheehanIllustrated by Michael Moore____________ _________ _________ _________ _MY CHRISTIAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS & HOW I HELPED AFTER KATRINAby Rev Jesse Jackson & Rev Al Sharpton____________ _________ _________ _________THINGS I LOVE ABOUT BILLby Hillary Clinton____________ _________ _________ __THINGS I LOVE ABOUT HILLARYTHE SEQUELby Bill Clinton____________ _________ _________ _____THINGS I CANNOT AFFORDby Bill Gates____________ _________ _________ ______THINGS I WOULD NOT DO FOR MONEYby Dennis Rodman____________ _________ _________ ___THINGS WE KNOW TO BE TRUEby Al Gore & John Kerry____________ _________ _________ _______AMELIA EARHART'S GUIDE TO THE PACIFIC____________ _________ _________ _____A COLLECTION of MOTIVATIONAL SPEECHESby Dr. J.

Kennedy International Airport as he attempted to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a compass, a slide-rule and a calculator.At a morning press conference, Attorney General Eric Holder said he believes the man is a member of the notorious Al-Gebra movement. He did not identify the man, who has been charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.'Al-Gebra is a problem for us', the Attorney General said. 'They derive solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in search of absolute values.' They use secret code names like 'X' and 'Y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined that they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country.As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'There are 3 sides to every triangle'.When asked to comment on the arrest, President Obama said, 'If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, he would have given us more fingers and toes.'White House aides told reporters they could not recall a more intelligent or profound statement by the President. It is believed that the Nobel Prize for Physics will follow... I sat, as did millions ofOther Americans, and watched as the governmentUnder went a peaceful transition Of power a few months ago.

It was then That I realized how farAmerica 's Military had deteriorated. Every damn one of them missed the bastard.

HE spoke for almost an hour on HIS future plans for increasing every Native American's present standard of living, since he has now become the President..

MORAL OF THE STORY: Be responsible for yourself! The Ant and the Grasshopper, Modern Version The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.CBS, NBC , PBS, CNN, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food.

A vehicle at 25 mpg and 12,000 miles per year uses 480 gallons a year.   So, the average clunker transaction will reduce US gasoline consumption by 320 gallons per year.   They claim 2,700,000 vehicles  so that's 224 million gallons / year. That equates to a bit over 5 million barrels of oil. 5 million barrels of oil is about  of one day's US consumption. And, 5 million barrels of oil costs about $350 million dollars at $75/bbl. So, we all contributed to spending $3 billion to save $350 million.  How good a deal was that ???An elderly couple had been experiencing declining memories, so they decided to take a power-memory class to learn how to remember things by association.A few days after the class, the old man was outside talking with his neighbor about how much the class helped him."What was the name of the instructor?" asked the neighbor."Oh, ummmm, let's see," the old man pondered. "You know that flower, you know, the one that smells really nice but has those prickly thorns, what's that flower's name?""A rose?" asked the neighbor."Yes, that's it," replied the old man.

More sighs and loud applause. Sadie Jones, age 88, stands and announces with a smile, 'If the Preacherstays .... I will give him sex!'There is total silence.

I went into the local coffee shop for a snack.I was only there for about 5 minutes. When I came out, there was this cop writing out a parking ticket. I said to him, 'Come on, man, how about giving a retired person a break'?He ignored me and continued writing the ticket.His insensitivity annoyed me, so I called him a 'PIG.' He glared at me and then wrote out another ticket for having worn tires.So I proceeded to call him a 'doughnut eating NAZI.'He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first.  Then he wrote a third ticket when I called him a 'moron in blue'.  This went on for about 20 minutes. The more I talked back to him themore tickets he wrote.  Personally, I didn't really care. I came downtown on the bus, and the car that he was putting the tickets on had one of those bumper stickers that said, 'Obama '08.'  I try to have a little fun each day now that I'm retired. The doctor tells me that it's important for my health Health Care Solved!! I am sure you have heard the ideas that if you're a senior you need to suck it up and give up the idea that you need any health care. A new hip? Unheard of. We simply can't afford to take care of you anymore. You don't need any medications for your high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, etc. Let's take care of the young people. After all, they will be ruling the world very soon.So here is the solution: When you turn 70, you get a gun and 6 bullets. You are allowed to shoot 3 senators and 3 representatives.Of course, you will be sent to prison where you will get:3 meals a day, a roof over your head and all the health care you need!!! New teeth, great!!! Need glasses, no problem. New hip, knee, kidney, lung,heart?Well bring it on. And who will be paying for all of this?Why, the same government that just told you that you are too old for health care.And, since you are a prisoner, you don't have to pay any income tax.

A Brit, an Italian and a Russian are viewing a painting of Adam and Eve frolicking in the Garden of Eden."Look at their reserve, their calm," muses the Brit. "They must be British.""Nonsense," the Italian disagrees. "They're naked, and so beautiful. Clearly, they are Italian.""No clothes, no shelter," the Russian points out, "they have only an apple to eat, and they're being told this is paradise. They are Russian."A picture says a thousand words...who's the racist???Compassion even crosses party lines. Al Gore, Bill Clinton and Barack go to heaven:God addresses Al first."Al, what do you believe in?''  Al replies: "Well, I believe that I won that election,but that it was your will that I did not serve. AndI've come to understand that now...'' God thinks for a second and says: "Very good. Come and sit at my left.'' God then addresses Bill. "Bill, what do you believe in?'' Bill replies: "I believe in forgiveness. I'vesinned, but I've never held a grudge against my fellowman, and I hope no grudges are held against me.'' God thinks for a second and says: You are forgiven, myson. Come and sit at my right.''Then God addresses Barack."Barack, what do you believe in?''He replies: "I believe you're in my chair." An economics professor at a local college made a statement that he had never failed a single student before, but had once failed an entire class. --------------------------------------------That class had insisted that Obama's socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer. The professor then said, "OK, we will have an experiment in this class on Obama's plan". All grades would be averaged and everyone would receive the same grade so no one would fail and no one would receive an A.After the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B.The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little. The second test average was a D! No one was happy. When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F. The scores never increased as bickering,blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else. All failed, to their great surprise, and the professor told them that socialismwould also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed. Could not be any simpler than that. Thanks to Obama, Luxury carsare soon to be a thing of the past.They have always been beyond my means but I took out aCadillac Escalade last week for a test drive, just to driveone before they become extinct.The salesman sat in the backseat describing the car and all it's wonderful options.The seats were of particular interest. He explained theseats directed warm air to your butt in the winter anddirected cool air to your butt> in the summer heat. I stated the auto must be a Republican car.He asked why I thought it was a Republican car. I explained if it were a Democrat car the seatswould just blow smoke up your ass. FIRST BOOK OF GOVERNMENT ....PSALM 2009 Obama is the shepherd I did not want. He leadeth me beside the still factories. He restoreth my faith in the Republican party. He guideth me in the path of unemployment for his party's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the bread line, I shall fear no hunger, for his bailouts are with me. He has anointed my income with taxes, My expenses runneth over. Surely, poverty and hard living will follow me all the days of my life, And I will live in a mortgaged home forever.  I am glad I am American, I am glad that I am free. But I wish I was a dog ... And Obama was a tree Somewhere in Texas or Montana?A man is sitting in a bar far from home when Barack Obama comes on TV.The man looks at the TV and says, "Obama is a horse's ass." Out ofnowhere, a local jumps up and punches him in the face, knocking thefirst guy off his bar stool, then stomps out. He gets up, rubbing hischeek and orders another beer.Shortly after, Michelle Obama appears on the TV. He looks at the TVand says, "She is a horse's ass too! " Out of nowhere, another localpunches him on the other side of the face, knocking him off his barstool again.He gets back up and looks at the bartender, "I take it this is Obama country""Nope." replies the bartender. "Horse country." A man, having been turned away at the Pearly Gates, was nonetheless grinning from ear to ear. Upon being asked about his inappropriate demeanor, he explained."Saint Peter said that I was being refused because I knowingly voted for candidates who support abortion, assisted suicide, and embryonic stem cell research.

Late one night in Washington, D.C., a robber jumps a well-dressed man and sticks a gun to his back.The robber demands, "Give me your money!"The man stiffened, but said indignantly, "You can't do this to me!

While looking around at the exotic merchandise, he noticed a very lifelike, life-sized, bronze statue of a rat. It had no price tag, but was so incredibly striking the tourist decided he must have it. He took it to the old shop owner and asked, "How much for the bronze rat?""Ahhh, you have chosen wisely! It is $12 for the rat, $100 for the story," said the wise old Chinaman. The tourist quickly pulled out twelve dollars. "I'll just take the rat, you can keep the story."As he walked down the street carrying his bronze rat, the tourist noticed that a few real rats had crawled out of the alleys and sewers and had begun following him down the street. This was a bit disconcerting so he began walking faster.A couple blocks later he looked behind him and saw to his horror the herd of rats behind him had grown to hundreds, and they began squealing.Sweating now, the tourist began to trot toward the Bay. Again, after a couple blocks, he looked around only to discover that the rats now numbered in the MILLIONS, and were squealing and coming toward him faster and faster.Terrified, he ran to the edge of the Bay and threw the bronze rat as far as he could into the Bay.Amazingly, the millions of rats all jumped into the Bay after the bronze rat, and were all drowned.The man walked back to the curio shop in Chinatown."Ahhh," said the owner, "You have come back for story?""No sir," said the man, "I came back to see if you have a bronze Democrat." An airliner was having engine trouble and the pilot instructed the cabin crew to have the passengers take their seats and get prepared for an emergency landing.A few minutes later, the pilot asked the flight attendants if everyone was buckled in and ready."All set back here, Captain," came the reply, "except the lawyers are still going around passing out business cards."

A Stimulus StoryIt is the month of April, on the shores of the Black Sea. It is raining,and the little town looks totally deserted. It is tough times, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.Suddenly, a rich tourist comes to town.He enters the only hotel, lays a 100 Euro note on the reception counter, andgoes to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one.The hotel proprietor takes the 100 Euro note and runs to pay his debt to thebutcher.The Butcher takes the 100 Euro note, and runs to pay his debt to the piggrower.The pig grower takes the 100 Euro note, and runs to pay his debt to thesupplier of his feed and fuel.The supplier of feed and fuel takes the 100 Euro note and runs to pay hisdebt to the town's prostitute that in these hard times, gave her "services" on credit.The hooker runs to the hotel, and pays off her debt with the 100 Euro noteto the hotel proprietor to pay for the rooms that she rented when she brought her clients there.The hotel proprietor then lays the 100 Euro note back on the counter.At that moment, the rich tourist comes down after inspecting the rooms, andtakes his 100 Euro note, after saying that he did not like any of the rooms, and leaves town.No one earned anything. However, the whole town is now without debt, andlooks to the future with a lot of optimism..And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how the United States Government underPresident BHO is doing business today.Barack Obama: "I only saw Rod Blagojevich one time ... and that was in the stands and from a distance at a Chicago Bears Football Game."

The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament.Dear Vincent,I am feeling pretty sad, because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here, my troubles would be over. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.Love, PapaA few days later, he received a letter from his son.Dear Pop,Don't dig up that garden. That's where the bodies are buried. Love, VinnieAt 4 a.m. FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left.That same day, the old man received another letter from his son.Dear Pop,Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That's the best I could do under the circumstances.

However, one of our secretaries has disappeared.

The speaker and His Holiness, however, have seen it all before.To make it a little more interesting, the speaker says to the Pope, "DidYou know that with just one little wave of my hand I can make everyDemocrat in the crowd go wild?"He doubts it, so she shows him. Sure enough, the wave elicits raptureand cheering from every democrat in the crowd. Gradually, the cheeringsubsides.The Pope, not wanting to be out done by such a level of arrogance,considers what he could do. "That was impressive, the Pope says, "Butdid you know that with just one little wave of MY hand I can make EVERYperson in the crowd go crazy with joy? This joy will not be a momentarydisplay like that of your subjects, but will go deep into their hearts,and they will forever speak of this day and rejoice."The speaker seriously doubts this, and says so. "One little wave of yourhand and all people will rejoice forever? Show me."So the Pope slapped her.An Israeli doctor said to a medical conference, "Medicine in my country is so advanced, we can take a kidney out of one person, put it into another and have him looking for work in six weeks!"

Not to be outdone, the American doctor stood up and addressed the conference, "Well", he said, "My country is so far advanced in medicine, we can take an Asshole out of Chicago , put it in the White House, and have half the country looking for work in 24 hours!" THE FIFTY DOLLAR LESSONI recently asked my friend's little girl what she wanted to be when she grew up. She said she wanted to be President one day. Both of her parents, liberal Democrats, were standing there, so I asked her, "if you were President, what would the first thing you would do?" She replied, " I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people." Her parents beamed. "Wow...what a worthy goal" I told her. " But you don't have to wait until you're President to do that You can come over to my house and mow the lawn, pull the weeds, and sweep my yard, and I'll pay you $50. Then I'll take you to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the $50 to use toward food and a new house." She thought that over for a few seconds, then she looked me straight in the eye and asked " Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him the $50?" I said, " Welcome to the Republican Party." Her parents still aren't speaking to me.The Priest, Harry and NancyThe old priest lay dying in the hospital.

"Father, of all the people you could have chosen, whydid you choose us to be with you as you near the end?"The old priest slowly replied "I have always tried to pattern my lifeafter our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." The old priestcontinued..."He died between two lying thieves. I would like to dothe same."Updated: March 32, 2009 Steelers to lose Super Bowl Trophies Pittsburgh, PA. The Super Bowl XLIII Champion Pittsburgh Steelers, the only team to win six titles, will soon be losing half of those trophies. After a meeting between NFL Commissioner Rodger Gadel and President Barack Hussain Obama, Obama decided to redistribute half of their Steeler Super Bowl victories and trophies to less fortunate teams in the league. We live everyday in the country that invented the Super Bowl. said Obama We are not about to lose this Great American tradition in the wake of these difficult times. Obamas plan calls for the Steelers, who are a successful NFL team, to give half of their Super Bowl trophies to teams that are not successful or have not been as successful as the Steelers. The Detroit Loins are just as much a part of the same fiber of the NFL as the Steelers and they should, no rather will, be entitled to a Super Bowl Trophy as well. Obama explains in his plan that he has imposed on Godel and the NFL. The Pittsburgh Steelers, who by virtue of hard work, excellent team play, stellar draft choices, responsible investing of free agents, careful hiring of coaches and excellent community service and commitment to their fans, has prospered greatly during the past 30 years and have won six Super Bowl Trophies. But President Barack Hussain Obamas plan calls for the Pittsburgh Steelers to carry the larger burden of the NFLs less successful teams. Obama went on to further proclaim, In these difficult times we are all in this to work together. We must reclaim the NFL Championship Dream for every team, for every city and for every fan. My plan will not affect 31 of the 32 teams in the league. Obama assures. Thats over 95 percent of the teams in the NFL will not have to worry about losing any Super Bowl Trophies. The worst teams in the NFL and the teams that cant seem to get a break and win a championship will no longer have to worry about going without a title. Obama promises. We are a country and league of hope. We all need to make a change. It does not matter the color of the teams uniforms, the personal decisions that the teams make or their performance but rather if they are a member of this great American league. The Super Bowl XLIII trophy will be redistributed to the 0-16 Detroit Lions. Through no fault of their own incompetence, the Lions could not manage a victory all season and this trophy will help ease the pain of their lack of performance and give them hope once again. The redistribution of Super Bowl XL trophy will go directly to the Steelers division rival the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals who also have fallen on hard times have never won a Super Bowl. This victory will bring a smile to hundreds of Bengal fans all over the world as they can now celebrate. Finally, one of the Steelers two Super Bowl victories over the Dallas Cowboys will go back to the Cowboys since the league needs to provide hope in the face of difficulty and provide hope in the face of uncertainty. This is a heavy burden for the Steelers but together we can all prosper. Steelers must now share their wealth and fruits of their success and hard work. The Dept Of Defense briefed the president this morning. They told President Obama that 2 Brazilian soldiers were killed in Iraq.To everyone's surprise, all the color drained from Obama's face. Then he collapsed onto his desk, head in his hands, visibly shaken, almost in tears.Finally, he composed himself and asked, 'Just how many is a brazilian?'This is not surprising, since he obviously has no understanding of billion or trillion either. Last Tuesday, as President Obama got off the helicopter in front of the White House: he was carrying a baby piglet under each arm.The squared away Marine guard snaps to attention, salutes, and says: "nice pigs, sir."The President replies "These are not pigs. These are authentic Arkansas Razorback Hogs. I got one for Senator Hillary Clinton and I got one for the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi."The Marine again snaps to attention, salutes, and says, "Excellent trade, sir!" Three dead bodies turn up at the mortuary, all with very big smiles on their faces.The coroner calls the police to tell them what has happened. TheCoroner tells the Inspector: "First body is a 72 year old Frenchman. He died of heart failure while with his mistress. Hence the enormous smile." "The second body is an Irishman, 25 years of age. He won a thousand Dollars on the lottery and spent it all on whisky. Died of alcohol poisoning, hence the smile." The Inspector asked, "What of the third body?" "Ah,"says the coroner, "This is the most unusual one, the third one is Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, 68, struck by lightning." "Why is she smiling then?" inquires the Inspector. "She thought she was having her picture taken."Some of you will recall that on July 8, 1947, a little over 60 years ago, witnesses claim that an unidentified flying object (UFO) with five aliens aboard crashed onto a sheep and cattle ranch just outside Roswell , New Mexico . This is a well known incident that many say has long been covered up by the U.S. Air Force and other federal agencies and organizations. The notorious Area 51 was created to aid in the cover-up.However, what you may NOT know is that in the month of April 1948, nine months after that historic day, the following people were born:Albert A. Gore, Jr.Hillary RodhamJohn F. KerryWilliam J. ClintonHoward DeanNancy PelosiDianne FeinsteinCharles E. SchumerBarbara BoxerSee what happens when aliens breed with sheep?I certainly hope this bit of information clears up a lot of things for you. It did for me.No wonder they support the bill to help illegal aliens!Now You Know. An Obituary printed in the London Times - Interesting and sadlyrather true.  Today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend, CommonSense, who has been with us for many years. No one knows for sure howold he was, since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucraticred tape. He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuablelessons as: - Knowing when to come in out of the rain; - Why the early bird gets the worm; - Life isn't always fair; - and maybe it was my fault.  Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don'tspend more than you can earn) and reliable strategies (adults, notchildren, are in charge). His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well-intentionedbut overbearing regulations were set in place. Reports of a 6-year-oldboy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teenssuspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacherfired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.  Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers fordoing the job that they themselves had failed to do in discipliningtheir unruly children.  It declined even further when schools were required to getparental consent to administer sun lotion or an aspirin to a student;but could not inform parents when a student became pregnant and wantedto have an abortion.  Common Sense lost the will to live as the churches becamebusinesses; and criminals received better treatment than their victims.  Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourselffrom a burglar in your own home and the burglar could sue you forassault.  Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a womanfailed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled alittle in her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement.  Common Sense was preceded in death, by his parents, Truth andTrust, by his wife, Discretion, by his daughter, Responsibility, and byhis son, Reason.  He is survived by his 4 stepbrothers; I Know My Rights I Want It Now Someone Else Is To Blame I'm A Victim  Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he wasgone. The Aisle SeatTwo Radical Arab Terrorists boarded a flight out of London.One took a window seat and the other sat next to him in the middleseat... Just before takeoff, a U.S. Marine sat down in the aisle seat.After takeoff, the Marine kicked his shoes off, wiggled his toes and wassettling in when the Arab in the window seat said, 'I need to get up andget a coke.' 'Don't get up,' said the Marine, 'I'm in the aisle seat, 'I'll get it for you.'As soon as he left, one of the Arabs picked up the Marines shoe and spatin it. When the Marine returned with the coke, the other Arab said, 'Thatlooks good, I'd really like one, too.' Again, the Marine obligingly wentto fetch it.. While he was gone the other Arab picked up the Marines othershoe and spat in it. When the Marine returned, they all sat back andenjoyed the flight.As the plane was landing, the Marine slipped his feet into his shoes andknew immediately what had happened. He leaned over and asked his Arabneighbors... 'Why does it have to be this way?' 'How long must this go on;this fighting between our nations, this hatred, this animosity, thisspitting in shoes and pissing in cokes?THE FEW, THE PROUD, THE MARINES!

Stimulus Bill ExplanationShortly after class, an economics student approaches his economics professor and says, "I don't understand this stimulus bill. Can you explain it to me?"The professor replied, "I don't have any time to explain it at my office, but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project, I'll be glad to explain it to you." The student agreed.At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor's house. The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool.They both went out back to the pool, and the professor /handed the student a bucket. Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, "First, go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you can." The student did as he was instructed.The professor then continued, "Follow me over to the shallow end, and then dump all the water from your bucket into it." The student was naturally confused, but did as he was told.The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, and began walking back to the deep end of the pool.The confused student asked, "Excuse me, but why are we doing this?The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper.The student didn't think the economics professor was serious, but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough.However, after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad. The student finally replied, "All we're doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits. Even worse, when this process is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all you'll really have accomplished is the destruction /of what could have been truly productive action!"The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, "Congratulations. You now understand the stimulus bill."Hell, back in 1990, the Government seized the Mustang Ranch brothel in Nevada for tax evasion and, as required by law, tried to run it.They failed and it closed.Now we trust the economy of our country and our banking system to the same nit-wits who couldn't make money running a whore house and selling whiskey!"Actual Letter to the Editor- Wichita FallsDear IRS,I am sorry to inform you that I will not be able to pay taxes owed April 15, but all is not lost.I have paid these taxes: accounts receivable tax, building permit tax, CDL tax, cigarette tax, corporate income tax, dog licence tax, federal income tax, unemployment tax, gasoline tax, hunting licence tax, fishing licence tax, waterfowl stamp tax, inheritance tax, inventory tax, liquor tax, luxury tax, medicare tax, city, school and county property tax (up 33 percent last 4 years), real estate tax, social security tax, road usage tax, toll road tax, state and city sales tax, recreational vehicle tax, state franchise tax, state unemployment tax, telephone federal excise tax, telephone federal state and local surcharge tax, telephone minimum usage surcharge tax, telephone state and local tax, utility tax, vehicle licence registration tax, capitol gains tax, lease severance tax, oil and gas assessment tax, Colorado property tax, Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, Oklahoma and New Mexico sales tax, and many more that I can't recall but I have run out of space and money.When you do not receive my check April 15, just know that it is an honest mistake.

One is from Chicago, another is from Tennessee, and the third is from Minnesota.All three go with a White House official to examine the fence. The Minnesota contractor takes out a tape measure and does some measuring, then works some figures with a pencil. "Well," he says, "I figure the job will run about $900: $400 for materials, $400 for my crew and $100 profit for me."The Tennessee contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says, "I can do this job for $700: $300 for materials, $300 for my crew and $100 profit for me."The Chicago contractor doesn't measure or figure, but leans over to the White House official and whispers, "$2,700." The official, incredulous, says, "You didn't even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?"The Chicago contractor whispers back, "$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the guy from Tennessee to fix the fence." "Done!" replies the government official.And that, my friends, is how the new stimulus plan will work.
