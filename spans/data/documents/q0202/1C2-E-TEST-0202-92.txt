A continuous struggle...
Climate change is causing the Arctic ice to melt and what remains is thinner and more treacherous. Polar bears need the ice to hunt so they are having to travel further and further to reach their prey. As the sea ice melts the area is also opened up to shipping and oil exploration adding pollution to the many threats the polar bear already faces.
Did you know...
...polar bears shelter their cubs in the safety of their snow dens when they go hunting for food. But as the ice melts,          these dens are collapsing on the cubs - leaving them vulnerable and exposed to extreme weather conditions.
...experts predict that Arctic sea ice could disappear completely in summer by 2040.
Adopt a polar bear today...
...by adopting a polar bear you can help us save the polar bear and its home from the          effects of climate change and pollution.
We must act now to try and save the polar bear from extinction.
Your support will also help fund other essential WWF conservation work around the world.
