Rescuers, and Humane Society & Animal Shelter Volunteers: The Unsung Heroes of Dog Rescue and Cat Rescue!
By Adopt-a-Pet.com's                               Pia Salk
Thank goodness for the humane society, SPCA, rescue organizations                          and hardworking, dedicated animal shelter volunteers! Without them,                          millions of pet dogs, cats, and even rabbits and horses would not                          find homes each year. Dog rescuers and cat rescuers scan animal shelters                          constantly, looking for puppies and kittens of all ages whose time                          at the animal shelter has almost run out due to overcrowding, and                          then giving them a second chance before they are euthanized. They                          all rely on volunteers and donations to keep their efforts going.                          Many rescues use a network of foster families, who keep pets for adoption                          in their own homes while they assess the pets' personalities,                          and often provide any necessary training. Rescues are very careful                          to make sure their adoptable dogs and cats go to the right homes.                          Each organization has its own application and screening process for                          potential adopters. In addition to protecting the pets, this process                          is designed to make sure you end up with the right pet for your family.                          Since pet rescues really get to know their dogs and cats                          for adoption , they are able to match you up with the perfect companion                          for you and your lifestyle. Volunteers also often follow up with you                          after the adoption to make sure everything's going well. They can                          help you get through any rough spots by offering training tips and                          other advice. Adopting from a pet rescue group has another benefit:                          if, for some reason, things don't work out with your new friend, most                          rescues will take the pet back, saving you a lot of heartache and                         headache.
Rescue groups come in all shapes and sizes. Like a humane society                          or SPCA, some rescue groups have a physical animal shelter facility,                          where adoptable dogs and cats are kept until they are get homes. Other                          pet rescue organizations use a network of dedicated foster families,                          volunteers who care for the dogs and cats in their own homes. Some                          rescue groups only take dogs and cats from public animal shelters;                          others take in strays and accept pets relinquished by their owners.                          There are even groups that specialize in senior or disabled dogs and                          cats. Some specialize in small dogs, some rescue only giant breeds.                          There are thousands of rescue groups devoted to a particular breed                          of dog or cat, too! At the heart of the rescue world, however, are                          the all-breed pet rescues. These are rescues that take in all kinds                          of pets of various breeds and ages, and concentrate on saving as many                          lives as possible.
All rescue groups have a few things in common. They are made up                          of extremely caring, passionate volunteers who work tirelessly to                          save pets' lives. Unfortunately, they often spend time days cleaning                          up the messes of irresponsible dog and cat owners, and trying to prevent                          new messes by educating the public about the responsibility of dog                          and cat ownership and the importance of spay and neuter. Even purebred                          dogs and cats end up in animal shelters because they were purchased                          at a pet store or from a dog breeder, and then they were no longer                          able to be cared for. Perhaps someone moved or died, or the pet grew                          too large. There are many reasons a pet ends up in need of a home,                          and most often, it has nothing to do with a problem with the pet at                          all. All rescue groups, SPCAs and humane societies deserve our most                          sincere gratitude for making this world a better place for dogs and                          cats!
Pet Adoption is the loving option!
So, you want to adopt a pet, huh? Great idea! Here are a few                      reasons why pet adoption is the loving option:
Saving Lives: Whether you adopt a pet from a local animal shelter or a rescue organization, humane society or SPCA, you're saving a                          life. In fact, if you adopt from an animal shelter, you're making                          room for another dog or cat to be rescued by allowing other dogs or                          cats at the shelter to be kept for a longer period of time, giving                          them a better shot at being adopted. If you adopt from a humane society,                          an SPCA or a rescue organization, you're allowing that organization                          to rescue another dog or cat for adoption at a public shelter, which,                          of course, saves the life of that little guy plus the lives of others                          at that shelter by creating space so new pets can be kept longer.                          As you can see, adoption is truly a continuous cycle of saving lives                         and it's the right thing to do!
You know what you're getting (especially if you adopt an adult): There                          are a lot of things to consider when you're deciding what kind of                          personality your new family member should have. When you adopt an                          adult dog or cat from a pet rescue, humane society or animal shelter                          instead of buying a puppy or kitten at a dog breeder or a pet store,                          you can see what you are getting. A mature pet's personality                          is already developed, and you'll be able to spot the characteristics                          you're looking for much more easily than with a puppy or kitten. Pet                          rescue organizations, as well as many animal shelter SPCAs and humane                          societies provide animal                          adoption counseling, and are able                          to assess the personality of each dog or cat for adoption and carefully                          match you up with the right one for your lifestyle. With a puppy or                          kitten, there is a lot more guesswork involved. Sure, you can train                          your puppy or kitten on certain behaviors, but other traits (like                          activity level) seem to be inherent in each individual. Just as you                          can know more when you meet a grown child who you can talk to than when you meet an infant, you know more about a grown pet you meet                          than about a puppy or kitten. Each pet has his/her own personality                          and you never really know how they will act with you, with children,                          and with other pets until they are a bit grown up. If you want to                          adopt a dog or cat who will instantly fit in with your family, then                          adopt a young adult, adult or even senior dog or cat from a humane                         society or SPCA, or from a rescue organization or animal shelter!
Pet adoption means an instant friend for life: Ask anybody who                          has adopted a pet, and they'll swear their bond with their rescued                          pal is as deep as they come. When you open your heart and your home                          to a pet who needs help, they really do show their appreciation for                          the rest of their life! Dogs or cats who have been uprooted from their                          homes, or have had difficult beginnings are likely to bond completely                          and deeply with their new human caretakers, whom they regard as heroes.                          Pups and kitties who find themselves in the shelter or at a rescue                          because of an owner's death or other tragedy in their former                          human family usually go through a mourning period. Once they are adopted,                          however, they want nothing more than to please their new hero---YOU!                          No matter what circumstances brought them to the rescue, most cats                          and dogs for adoption are exceptionally affectionate and attentive,                         and make extremely loyal companions.
Training and Socialization: Many rescue organizations use foster                          homes, where puppies and kittens for adoption are socialized with                          children and other dogs and cats, and given basic obedience training                          before they go to their new homes. Many dogs and cats in animal shelters                          and humane societies are already housebroken, trained and ready to                          go! As an added bonus, many organizations offer post-adoption workshops                          and training classes. When you adopt from these animal shelters, you'll                          have their continued support to help you through any rough spots you                         face during your dog or and cat's transition.
A smarter option than buying a puppy or kitten from a "backyard                          dog breeder" or pet store: There are pet stores that get                          their puppies and kittens from one of two sources: 1) a "backyard" cat                          or dog breeder, or 2) a puppy mill. Some purebred dogs and cats are                          the product of irresponsible "backyard" kitten and puppy                          breeders, who are not in it for the love of the breed, but rather                          to make money. These are people who make some easy cash by breeding                          their purebred dogs and cats and they often also sell puppies and                          kittens through the newspaper classified ads. Remember if you buy                          a dog or buy a cat in this way, the pet may not have been                          bred for favorable health and temperament qualities, and many of these                         puppies and kittens are weaned from their mothers way too soon.
What are puppy mills? A puppy mill is a purebred puppy factory farm                          where the puppies are just churned out as fast as they can and then                          sold to pet stores. The dogs are kept in small cages and forced to                          breed at unhealthy rates. Female dogs in puppy mills are made to have                          several litters per year, which is dangerous and cruel. Each purebred                          puppy mill produces several different breeds for pet stores, and pays                          little attention to the specific health and genetic diseases due to                          inbreeding. Genetic health testing is almost unheard of and mass-producing                          pets for profit is the bottom line. In the worst puppy mills, pets                          are kept in dirty conditions and given little or no socialization.                          If you are about to buy a dog or buy a cat, please consider that adoption                          is the most humane option! You can start your search to adopt a pet online , find a shelter pet with Adopt-a-Pet.com, and then go                         and adopt the pet. Thanks for saving a life!
Dog Adoption and
"Get the info & get
in the know"
Did you know that approximately 4 million adoptable dogs & cats are killed each year due mainly to overpopulation? Did you know that 25-30% of dogs for adoption in animal shelters are purebred? The other 70-75%, of course, are lovable, wonderful mixed-breed pets, just waiting for a chance to be your perfect new friend.
In an effort to help people make good choices when they adopt a dog or cat, many humane societies, SPCAs and pet rescues provide adoption counseling to help match you up with a pet for adoption.
If you have your heart set on a specific breed, before you check out a dog breeder or pet store, why not adopt a pet from a breed rescue organization? Breed rescues are groups that specialize in a particular breed of dog or cat.
Don't be fooled into thinking that animal shelters and pet rescues are filled with dog or cats that were discarded because they're "bad". Shelter pets for adoption are wonderful companions who became the victims of family tragedy, unlucky circumstances or irresponsible owners.
Did you know that many backyard dog breeders and pet stores who supply the majority of purebreds simply are selling inbred pets without care for preventing genetic problems? Mixed breed pets have less inbreeding, generally less inherited genetic disease, and therefore overall lower vet bills and happier pets! And the best place to find a mixed breed dog or cat is at an SPCA, a humane society or an animal shelter.
