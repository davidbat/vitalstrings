Three  European Union countries have chosen not to join the euro 
Denmark
Danish people voted on 28 September 2000 to stay       out of the euro. Turnout was more than 90 per cent and the vote was 53:47       to keep the krone. A new referendum was promised by the Danish Prime      Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen after he was re-elected for a third term. He      told journalists on 22 November 2007 "The time is approaching. It is the      government's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the      opportunity to take a stance on the Danish EU opt-outs. It is the      government's view that the opt-outs damage Danish interests." No date has      yet been set. An opinion poll       taken after the introduction of the euro notes and coins showed 57% in       favour of joining. The Danish currency is already pegged to the euro      through the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Sweden
The Swedish people voted by a      significant majority to stay out of the euro in a referendum held on 14      September 2003. Despite support for the euro by the political and business      establishment the result was 56.1% against, 41.8% in favour of Sweden      adopting the euro as its currency. Turnout was 81.2% and 1.9% of votes were      neither for nor against.
United Kingdom
The Coalition Government in the UK has ruled out   joining the euro in the current Parliament which is due to end in May 2015.   There is little political or public appetite to join especially after the   economic difficulties in several euro members including Greece and Ireland.
