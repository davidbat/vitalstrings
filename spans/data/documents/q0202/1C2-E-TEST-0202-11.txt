We had a vote in England. Most people wanted to keep the pound for these reasons...
1) At the time the pound was doing well economically and had a high exchange rate. Changing over to the Euro would have negatively influenced the market.
2) Britains are very much traditionalists. They didn't want to give up their Pound Sterling for the Euro. They're also generally rather conservative people, especially when it comes to their culture. They didn't want to familiarize themselves with a new currency.
3) At the time there was a lot of arguments about whether or not the UK should be in the EU (there still is) and people didn't want to adopt the EU's major currency.
I don't know about the Danish, I believe the Swedish also had an economic advantage over the Euro and didn't wish to lose it.
