KANE
BEING FOSTERED IN WITNEY, OXFORDSHIRE
22-05-12 Kane is a 10 month old Westie. He is such a sweet boy but has Perthes disease in his hip and needs an operation to help with this. This looks likely to be performed tomorrow and we will know so much more about his prognosis after his operation and will update then.
29-05-12 UPDATE
Kane has had the operation on his leg and is now on crate rest to let it heal nicely. As you can see by his photo he is finding crate rest a little yawnsome and dull! We are providing squeaky toys and delicious treats to keep him occupied and happy as he needs to keep still for now to let his leg mend. Kane is a lovely little dog. He travelled home in the car on my lap very well, he was very laid back and relaxed. He met my dogs with a happy, waggy tail and lies in his bed happily watching the world go by.This gorgeous boy is very confident and could easily be an only dog. He is so friendly.
15-06-12 UPDATE 
 
 
Kane has recovered very well from his leg surgery and is now practicing using his leg. Kane is loving his new life and has the sweetest personality. He is perfect for any Westie lovers, he is playful but content to snooze at your feet if you don't want to play right now, or to potter about after a ball. He loves his chewy toys and enjoys sitting on your knee for a cuddle. Kane is excellent with other dogs, ignores my cats completely and is wonderful with my children aged 4 to 12. He enjoys a ride in a car and is going for short walks now. A true young gentleman indeed.
28-06-12 UPDATE
 Kane's prognosis after his operation looks good and we are hopeful for a full recovery, although there are no guarantees.  Four weeks post op Kane is just starting to weight bear on his leg. If he is not using it fully at 8 weeks a further x-ray will be considered. He has moved to a new foster home with easier access to hydrotherapy to help his recovery.

PATCHES
RESERVED
BEING FOSTERED IN LYDNEY, GLOUCESTERSHIRE
05-06-12 Patches is a very striking 2yr old Jack Russel Terrier x Corgi. This gorgeous boy is one happy chappy! He has been well socialised and his tail has not stopped wagging since he arrived. This chap would fit into any home - he will just make anyone who meets him smile. We think he looks rather regal with his Corgi looks and all who have met him agree he is an absolutely fantastic dog!
28-06-12 UPDATE
 
 
 He's been with us less than a week, but we wholeheartedly agree that Patches is indeed 'an absolutely fantastic dog'! He's a great little chap with his circus clown looks and gentle nature, and we're still waiting for that tail to stop wagging. Patches (or Paddy Patches as he seems to have become) is all you could ask for in a little companion - quiet, housetrained, friendly with both dogs and humans, sociable, eager to please, easily corrected, undemanding, hilarious, affectionate, inquisitive, super-bright and responsive to any treat training, playful, dopey, sleepy....the list goes on. Even though he is a rescue dog he seems to have no 'issues' and we have no idea why anyone would have abandoned him. He's a perfect pet for any home, young family or older people, and would be just as good as an only dog as with some canine company.

ERNIE
BEING FOSTERED IN SEAFORD, EAST SUSSEX
23-03-12 Ernie is a 4 year old ex stud Bichon. He has come to us to find a forever home. He wags his tail and is a happy and friendly boy who seems to be quite easy going. He is good with other dogs he has met here and will need another dog already living in the home to learn from. He has not lived in a house so will need to learn about house training and does not know how to walk on a lead.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company. They usually get their confidence and learn faster with another dog to copy from. This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up. Please read our information on adopting ex breeding dogs before you apply.
01-05-12 UPDATE
Ernie is a gentle soul and gets on well with my other dogs. He is good when eating with them and follows them out in the garden. He enjoys the garden in the sunshine. He needs reassurance from another dog and has been seen playing with a couple of them but most of mine are too old to bother. He is nervous of wide open spaces and only walks on the lead when behind me as he will then follow. When I have him on the lead he refuses to go. Bad weather has meant we haven’t been out recently as he hates rain! He has started to enjoy cuddles but sinks to the floor before being picked up. Loud noises or sudden movements still scare him. He is a lovely chap and let me cut his fur without complaint even though it took a while as it was so thick. He is no bother in the house and very undemanding. He just wants someone to love him and another small canine companion to lead the way. Could you be his special person?
24-05-12 UPDATE
Ernie is such a sweet little dog who loves cuddling on the sofa. He has gained in confidence and behaves perfectly in the home, and with my other dogs. He enjoys going for walks in country parks, and is off lead now. He tends to walk behind my feet with one of my own dogs, but will also wander further away with them . He is not interested in farm animals in the fields, nor does he chase rabbits/birds, but he will greet other dogs that we meet in a friendly manner. He visited my grandchildren (ages 4 and 2 ) last week and behaved perfectly with them, and in their house. He is so gentle and doesn’t jump up. He is also excellent when travelling in the car, and walks well on the lead, providing he can be behind my feet.( I have not yet tried walking him near traffic.) He would make a wonderful companion as he is so undemanding. He would of course need another small dog for company when left. So what are you waiting for.? Apply for this happy little fellow. 
28-06-12 UPDATE
Ernie is gaining in confidence and is often found playing with my younger dogs/fosters. He is not a demanding dog and is happy taking slow strolls in the park. He would be ideal for an older couple who want to take life easy, as long as he has another small doggie companion. He is good when eating with the other dogs and is also fine with gentle young children having met my grandchildren (ages 2 and 4) a few times. He is not a large Bichon so is easy to pick up should the need arise. He is just looking for his special person to love. How about you?

KETCH
BEING FOSTERED IN FISHGUARD, PEBROKESHIRE
22-06-12 Ketch is a pretty 7 week old female Collie cross who has come in to us with her sister Kiss. This little girl is sweet, inquisitive and as bright as a button! She is a little calmer than her sister and is looking for a lovely, playful home where she can attend puppy training classes and be spayed by the age of six months.
25-06-12 UPDATE
Ketch is the least confident of the 2, allowing her sister to go first and try out the new things first. As soon as Ketch see from her sister that something is safe, fun, or just pleasant then she will join in too. This went for coming out of the crate, meeting out dogs to allowing us to pick her up for cuddles. Ketch is the chunkiest and cuddliest of the two with beautiful soft fur. When I first picked Ketch up she immediately put one paw either side of my neck and snuggled her face next to mine. No licking, just comfort. That was the first time Ketch had done something without her sister. Ketch is a special girl who will be ideal for someone looking for company who walks long distances or someone who has all the time to appreciate all the love which this little pup showed me she has to give. Ketch is very food motivated and loves playing with the bigger dogs although she is also content to 'sit it out' and watch. Ketch would be great as an only animal or as a companion for another dog. Ketch is very gentle in everything she does, apart from eating!! The pictures can't do her justice.
 28-06-12 UPDATE
 
 
 Ketch LOVES cuddles, they are the best treat ever, as soon as you pick Ketch up regardless of what she is doing she flops down into your arms but at the same time returning the cuddle by wrapping her paws around you side, it is beautiful to watch the contentment and her tail gently wags and her breathing slows with the comfort she gets from being held. Ketch is very easy pup and perfect for a family or as a first time pup due to her calmness and eagerness to please.

KISS
RESERVED
BEING FOSTERED IN FISHGUARD, PEBROKESHIRE
22-06-12 Kiss is an incredibly sweet female 7 week old Collie cross puppy. She is a confident, happy, waggy little pup and as busy as a bee! A typical collie cross pup this little cutie will need an active home where she goes to puppy training classes and she will need to be spayed by the age of six months. When she is older she would just love to do some agility or similar to keep her clever mind stimulated.
25-06-12 UPDATE
No picture I took does this pup justice, she is a beautiful girl. Kiss arrived here after sleeping all the way home (over an hour) with no accidents in the crate. As soon as the crate door was opened out came a very timid little pup peering round her to check where she was, what was different and what had changed!! We took Kiss and her sister both into the garden where they had wees and explored the garden. Kiss discovered that part of the garden was fenced off so sat back on her haunches looking at it for a while, trying to suss out a way in.... 24 hours later she's still working it out. Kiss has shown no interest in our cat but a lot of interest in our bigger dogs who she loves to play with but will only take it so far accepting a telling off when she gets one (normally a little warning growl does the trick). Kiss got told off by our labrador (a rather loud belly growl - Kiss was pulling her face) and Kiss ran away very fast screaming (which terrified OUR lab!). Later Kiss was STILL running away t whenever she saw the 'big scary dog' but today, they are the best of friends. Kiss can be a little mouthy with people, this is easily solved by a sharp 'NO'. Out of the 2 puppies Kiss is the last one to give in when it comes to falling asleep and is the boldest of the two. 'NO' works very well on her and she responds very well to other dogs body language knowing when they want to play and when they don't. Kiss is a very happy pup with an extremely waggy tail and loves to play chase. Kissbeing very food motivated is easy to train and will excel at puppy classes. Kiss would be wonderful as an only dog or as a companion for another.
 28-06-12 UPDATE
  
 
 Kiss is a very well named pup who greats anyone that she hasn't seen for up to 5 minutes with kisses and cuddles. Her favourites are beards. Kiss is a very lively pup but very focussed on pleasing you, she knows the word 'NO' and 'LEAVE' and we hardly ever have to use it now. Kiss shows no interest in our cat at all even though the cat has done his best to get her to chase him. Kiss has great respect for all dogs of all ages and is very inquisitive and excited by life yet as soon as she is turned on her back in your arms like a baby she goes into 'gentle' mode and softly holds your thumb with her paws and nibbles gently on it, or just holds it. Nothing I can write will describe how gentle this pup can be, yet busy too. Kiss really is a special pup with no issues, very easy to train and loves people. An all round easy pup.

ROWAN
BEING FOSTERED IN MALVERN, WORCESTERSHIRE
20-06-12 This little sweetheart is Rowan. He is a 14 week old Cavipoo ( Cavalier cross Poodle) who has come to us to find a home. He is timid and unsure at the moment and will need need a home where any children are older and where his owners have lots of time and patience to help him become a well socialised and happy little pup. He such a sweet poppet! As with all our pups Rowan will need to be neutered by the age of six months and attend puppy classes. 
28-06-12 UPDATE
  
 Rowan is such a tiny baby but so beautiful. When I collected him on Sunday he was so frightened I couldn't get near him and when I did pick him up he went rigid. After only three days he will now come up to me for a fuss and when picked up he relaxes and cuddles into me. He sits and looks at me with such sad puppy eyes that it is hard to resist him. Rowan is clean and dry at night in his crate and he is going outside to toilet with my dogs with just the occasional accident in the house. Next week after his 2nd injection I will start trying to walk him on a harness and lead. Whoever adopts this baby will be a very lucky person as Rowan deserves the very best.

TINY
BEING FOSTERED IN PORT ISAAC, CORNWALL
12-04-12 Tiny is a 3 year old female terrier. She has been given up as her family's circumstances changed. She is playful and sweet and would love a country retreat! We are told she lived with children and we have certainly found her to be incredibly sweet with people. She is very sad in kennels please offer her a forever home.
28-06-12 UPDATE
Tiny (responding to Tilly) is only 7kg in weight and is a very pretty, dainty probably Parsons x Chihuahua who is delighted to be back in a home, where she is quiet, beautifully behaved, housetrained and well used to a busy household. She is a real girly dog and loves having a pamper and we have barely heard her voice. Tiny is very loving and loyal with the most expressive eyes which are very hard to resist, as is her endearing little wiggle-dance. She is now very attached to us and is always off lead here on the farm and on beaches, trotting along happily doing whatever we are. She really doesn’t want to share human love & attention with my other dogs so would probably be happiest as an only dog. She confidently tackles everything asked of her and behaves beautifully in public – deliberately avoiding or ignoring other dogs and meeting all kids gently. Out of preference Tilly gravitates to women, but is loving to all her family. She can be a little aloof with strangers, but is always polite. Tiny loves a very fast game of fetch but is equally happy to stroll beside us or crash out in the sunshine while we garden. Outside she is interested in everything, but never to a degree that she can’t be persuaded to leave it and is now perfectly behaved around our poultry, wildfowl and the horse. When cat-tested, she knew to respect the feline species! She loves to go out and about in the car and gets excited when her lead appears, travels long distance happily and was unfazed by an overnight stopover away. Tiny is the perfect size and temperament to fit in with a variety of lifestyles and situations – her only demand is that she spends her day alongside you. She is a playful little wiggly charmer and a real snuggly poppet who fits neatly into a lap when invited. Tiny is a ready-made adult dog who would learn a new routine with ease and make the most devoted friend - she is well worth the journey to Cornwall.

JOEY
BEING FOSTERED IN STEVENTON, OXFORDSHIRE
20-06-12 Joey is a small terrier boy who is about 4 months old. He was dumped at a pound but no one was interested in adopting him. His last day came but luckily a doggy angel took him to his home and then asked for our help. Joey is a typical, happy little terrier.... he has lots of energy and will benefit from training and would love an active home with a secure garden.
28-06-12 UPDATE
 
 What a happy little soul Joey is. Don't let those whiskers fool you, he might look like an old boy but he is a puppy through and through. He loves to play and run around. He is very inquisitive and is always on the go looking for new things to smell and play with. He has settled without a whimper at night from the start and is happy to be left but this may be down to the calming influence of my dogs. He is clean at night and is mostly clean in the house during the day if he has easy access to outside!  Joey loves his walks and knows his name although last night the lure of a good roll in something invisible but very smelly was too much to resist.   At nearly 5 months he's a small JRT with maybe a touch of westie hence the ears and long fur. Doesn't seem to have any hang ups although he has on occasion got a bit snappy when I have taken something off of him that he shouldn't have. Just like a child who has had no boundaries in place he is doing what he wants to do. But he is a bright dog who wants to be friends. He has been firmly told no and I think he will soon learn that this is unacceptable. He is fine with older children 8+ years who do not tease him. He would be best with a slightly older female dog to have as a friend to play with and when he has been neutered he will be a perfect companion.

RACHEL
BEING FOSTERED IN NR MELKSHAM, WILTSHIRE
 
23-06-12 Rachel is a stunning 5 year old ex breeding Cavalier Spaniel. She is a sweet girl, so good when we groomed her today. She had a few mats which had caused her skin to be a little sore in places but we are treating this and hopefully this will heal quickly. She will need another dog to live with for company and support. She does not know how to walk on a lead and has never lived in a house before so she will need a patient, understanding and loving home.
 28-06-12 UPDATE
  
 
 Rachel is really beautiful, she has been with us for 5 days and has settled very well. She is not quite as confident as her friend Rosemary but is learning all about home life very quickly. She has just started to learn to walk on a lead, she is a little nervous but making good progress. She is very friendly with people and other dogs. She loves her food ! and has learnt to eat out of her bowl. She has also been clean through the night , she sleeps well and is a very contented little girl. She travels well in the car, was very good at the groomers.

23-06-12 Rosemary is a 7 year old Cavalier who has come to us from a breeder to find her forever home. She is a happy girl, quite relaxed being handled. She will need another dog to live with and needs socialising. Rosmary needs to learn about lead walking and pet life. She hasn't lived in a house before so she will need to learn about housetraining etc. She has an ear infection at the moment, which is being treated. She is such a sweetheart. 
28-06-12 UPDATE
  
 Rosemary has been with us now for 5 days. She is a very confident little girl and for an ex breeding dog, she is very friendly and outgoing and a lot less nervous than many. She is good in the car, she was excellent at the groomers. We have started lead training her and she is making really good progress. Rosemary really loves her friends, she is good with all our dogs and others she has met when out and about. She has been clean through then night and has learnt the routine of the house very quickly. The garden is a real favourite she is happy to wander and come when called with the others. Rosemary has not seen cats with us, she has seen some traffic and was just fine. This little girl loves to be on your knee and soaks up love and affection. She is really a very easy, kind loving dog.

EMILY
BEING FOSTERED IN SUTON COALFIELD, WARWICKSHIRE
06-06-12 Emily is an 18m old collie cross. She has been tied up for a good part of her life and is very thin and shy. However she is a stunning girl who is great with other dogs. Everything is new to this sensitive girl and she would benefit from a calm and confident dog in her new home to help her build her confidence up and show her the way. She is a little insecure at the moment so would suit a home where any children were teenagers and she would love to go to socialisation classes to help her learn more. Emily is sweet, bright, keen to please and walks well on the lead. 
28-06-12 UPDATE
  
 Hello my name is Emily and I have not lived a happy life before coming to Many Tears. I have been tied up and I am underweight. I am scared of everything including my shadow. I am 18 months old and I am a very small cross collie. I am currently living with my foster mum and she has two dogs that help to reassure me. I need lots of time space and oodles of tender loving care. So far I can walk nice on a lead (but I am not confident to go anywhere). I also sleep in a dog crate in the kitchen of a night time. I go straight to sleep and do not moan or cry. In the day my foster mum lets me go out in the garden every few hours to use the toilet and I have not had any accidents in the house. I greet dogs nicely and get along with all the dogs. I do not know how to play with dogs or toys but my foster mum said when I am more relaxed I may learn how to play with toys.

WILLOW
27-06-12 Willow is a very sweet 7 year old poodle. Although she has not ever been taught to walk on a lead, she is so placid and kind that we feel she may be able to be an only dog in the right hands and the right set up.  She has always lived with and is is very good with other dogs so could easily be homed with others too. She is small and petite and will need help with house training and owners who understand that she will need time and patience to settle into her new home.

DAISY
RESERVED
26-06-12 Daisy is a 6 year old Westie who has come to us to find a new home as she can be a bully with similar sized female dogs. For this reason she is looking for a new home with bigger dogs, ideally male. It has been described as a jealousy issue. We have been told that she originally came from a breeding kennels before she was taken on by her last farm home. She apparently has a good recall and loves attention. She is a beginner on the lead and has lots of energy, she will run around all day. She can be a little nervous travelling in the car so this is an area that will need work. She is apparently good with children, cats, chickens and livestock as she has been living on a farm. She is apparently nearly housetrained BUT not 100% so she will need a patient understanding home who could continue her training. She might like to go to a home as an only dog BUT will need someone to be there all the time. She is bright and responsive.

LUCY
BEING FOSTERED NEAR MELKSHAM, WILTSHIRE
 26-06-12 Hello my name is Lucy, I am a 6 year old cavalier who very sadly looking for a new home. I was rescued by Many Tears 3 months ago and was lucky enough to get a new home very quickly. Sadly I did not get along with the older resident dog and this upset my new Mum so I have come back to my foster home. I really want to have lots of attention and love as I fear it may run out, having only recently discovered what it is like to have lots of affection. My foster mum, says I am behaving very well and I am learning to be more patient and not as demanding, I am living with lots of other cavaliers and I get on with them all. I am a sociable outgoing little girl, with a very loveable nature. I really would love someone who has a lot of time to spend with me. I am confident and love walks on my lead; I travel well in the car , and I am completely housetrained. I really love my food and eat with 3 of my friends with no problems. I like people and I am very sociable with visitors. I have met cats who lived next door and I also lived with a parrot who didn’t bother me at all once I got used to him. I sleep through the night but if I could sleep upstairs with you that would be a great bonus! I have met a couple of children but only briefly, my foster mum says, I would be best suited to live with slightly older children. I have recently had a full medical and I am fine except for the fact that like a lot of Cavi’s of my age I have a heart murmur and need one tablet every day, which will not be covered on insurance. If you are looking for a very lovable canine friend, please consider me.
 With love Lucy x

SPANGLES
 BEING FOSTERED IN FISHGUARD, PEMBROKESHIRE
25-06-12 Spangles is a very adorable 8 week old female poodle puppy. She has deformed back legs and will be going for x-rays to investigate this further. She is not in any pain and absolutely loves running around playing. When Spangles isn’t busy investigating her surroundings she is bit of a cuddle monkey and loves to snuggle in. She will be looking for a home where she won’t be left for more than a couple of hours a day and will need to go to puppy socialization classes. 
26-06-12 UPDATE
 Spangles has been to the vets for an x-ray today. This has revealed that she has been born with no knee joints. The vet feels that a huge and almost certainly unsuccessful reconstruction is not the right thing for this sweet little girl. She is such a happy little dog who is able to move around in her own unique way and is looking for a loving home who are accepting of this.

WHITTLE
BEING FOSTERED IN CROWBOROUGH, EAST SUSSEX
02-05-12 Whittle is a female Yorkie who has come to us from a breeder. She is approximately 8 years old. She is a sweet and gentle girl who will need another dog for companionship and to learn from. She is starting to learn how to walk on the lead and likes to sniff the ground as she goes along. She does not shy away from human contact. She does have a mammary lump that the vet will look at ASAP as well as her teeth as they need a little TLC. She has a slightly deformed left ear which does not seem to be causing her any problems, just adding to her cheeky charm.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company. They usually get their confidence and learn faster with another dog to copy from. This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up. Please read our information on adopting ex breeding dogs before you apply.
09-05-12 UPDATE
Whittle has had her mammary lumps removed but may require further attention in the future. This will need to be monitored by her adopters and for this reason Whittle is by donation.
01-06-12 UPDATE
Whittle is a lovely little Yorkie girl who tries to be brave and approach you for cuddles, but sometimes gets scared and runs away. She has not had one accident since she arrived and has just started to walk on a lead & harness. She doesn't have very much fur on her back and during this very hot weather we have had recently, I have used a baby t-shirt and sun cream to cover her skin so that she doesn't get burnt. She does chase our cats if they run in the garden, but will ignore them in the house. She is never far away from her friend Waver, but they do interact ok with our other dogs we have here. She will need a home with another small dog and a home with older children or none at all. 
26-06-12 UPDATE
 Whittle is a sweet little Yorkie who is adjusting to home life very well. She is still wary of strangers but is now walking very well on her lead and harness. She is showing less interest in the cats now she knows them. Her fur is growing back nicely on her back, but we still have to be careful in the sun as it is very thin at the moment. She still does everything with her friend Waver and they can always be found together in a bed somewhere. She has not had any accidents in the house for a while now. She will need a quiet and understanding house to live in, where there is one or more other little dog for her to cuddle up to.

WAVER
BEING FOSTERED IN CROWBROUGH, EAST SUSSEX
02-05-12 Waver is a ex-breeding female Yorkie who is approximately 7 years of age. She runs up to greet you, wagging her tiny little stump of a tail non-stop. She is a beginner on the lead but is picking it up very quickly. She would like another dog as she loves their company would need to be very patient as she will not know anything about housetraining. Her front legs appeared to be a little bowed but this does not seem to cause her any difficulty.

01-06-12 UPDATE
Waver is the smallest of the Yorkies I currently have here and does follow her friend Whittle everywhere. She has been very good with house training and is now clean in the house. She has just started to walk on a lead & harness, but is not as forthcoming as her friend Whittle. She does chase our cats if they run in the garden but will ignore them in the house. She is currently reliant on Whittle, however she is starting to interact more with our dogs. She will need a home with another small dog and one without children. 
26-06-12 UPDATE
 Waver is coming up to us more now for a chin stroke, then she scuttles back to the safety of her bed where her friend Whittle is waiting. She too is showing less interest in the cats and is walking well on her lead and harness. Again, she is still wary of strangers and will require another dog and an understanding home for her to live in.

PUMPKIN
BEING FOSTERED IN CROWBOROUGH, EAST SUSSEX
30-05-12 Pumpkin is a 5 year old male Beagle. This sweet boy has come to us from a breeder to find a new home. We think he may have a problem in his back as his back legs are a little wobbly and we will be investigating this. He is a happy, lovable chap who walks nicely on the lead and would love an understanding home.

06-06-12 UPDATE
Pumpkin is the sweetest of boys. He has seen the vet and had x-rays and nothing could be seen to explain why he has difficulty walking - it must be neurological. Other than his walking Pumpkin is a perfectly normal boy. His walking is sometimes better than others and he does sometimes completely lose his balance. He is not phased at all and has obviously learned to cope with it. He does wear his nails down on his back feet so he would need boots of something to protect his feet when he goes for walks. He is so well behaved with all the dogs he has met, both male and female. Pumpkin spent some time in the office and he was a hit with all the office staff. He is just so friendly and inquisitive. He loves his food and will do anything for some yummy treats. If you would be able to offer this boy a home or a foster home he will be so appreciative.
26-06-12 UPDATE
 
 
Pumpkin is a very handsome and loving Beagle who adores everybody he meets and they in return, adore him. He has been totally clean in the house after the initial marking on day one. He is friendly and submissive with all the dogs he meets and is currently living with quite a few dogs. Also, surprisingly for a Beagle, he is not food obsessive, but will check to make sure the other dogs have eaten their food up! He will chase a running cat in the garden, however doesn't bother with them if they walk round the house etc. The kind of home Pumpkin requires due to his back leg problem, is one with a decent sized grassed area with very few steps. He can climb up a step into a back door for example, but this causes him to drag his legs and we do not want him to damage or hurt his legs with lots of steps. I walk him on a harness as he finds this more supportive if his legs suddenly give way, I can take some of his body weight. He is carried to the car to avoid any contact with concrete etc or I push him in the doggie pushchair we have, which he now loves! He loves going to our local park where the grass is long and I let him run round on a long line. He does like running, but then when his legs give way, he just rests for a while, before running round again. He also comes walking down our local woods where the ground is soft and walks very well - albeit not for a great time at the moment as he obviously gets tired quickly. He is such a loving dog, loves sitting on your lap for a cuddle, (I don't think he realises he's a bit too big for that really). He adores going out for short walks, so please do not apply for him if you think he is a dog that doesn't need walking, as he does, and loves it so much!

MILO
BEING FOSTERED IN FAREHAM, HAMPSHIRE
13-04-12 Milo is a 5 year old terrier cross who is sadly completely blind. He is a sweet and quiet fellow who is trying to get his bearings at the moment. He was rescued from the pound where he was dumped as no body wanted him. He will be the perfect companion, please research blind dogs before applying but please do not be put off by Milo's blindess - he is a terrific little guy who has adapted well to his condition and can live with or without another dog.
 26-06-12 UPDATE
 Please don't scroll past Milo just because he is blind, please read about him and think about all that he has to offer, he is a gentle and loving dog who is well behaved and clean in the house, he is fine to be left for reasonable periods of time and he walks well on a lead. He likes nothing better than to cuddle up close to you and have his back rubbed. Milo is doing well here in his foster home but he would be much happier living in his forever home as an only dog or with one other calm dog that wouldn't jump on him. Milo can be worried by lots of dogs around him as he can't see what they are doing, he will often take himself to a quiet area of the house away from the 6 other dogs here, but that also means away from us. This is a shame because he loves to be around people, he just can't relax with the other dogs. One of Many Tears supporters on the Fundraising Forum, wrote how people turn to dogs when they go blind to guide them but when a dog goes blind, who is there for them? Nobody wants them, Milo really deserves a loving home, please consider him, I adopted a blind dog and 3 years on I am so pleased I did as our Rosie is just gorgeous, if you adopted Milo I am sure you would feel the same about him.

SPOT
BEING FOSTERED IN LAMPETER, CEREDIGION
30-05-12 Spot is a 10 month old terrier who has come to us from a home. He was much loved and has been sadly given up as his owner was elderly and too unwell to give him the exercise he needs. He is frightened in his new surroundings and will need a quiet and loving home without young children who will take the time and care to socialise him as we think this lad has seen very little of the world. He is such a worried boy here and we hope someone will offer him a home very soon.
02-06-12 UPDATE
Spot needs someone VERY VERY SPECIAL. He is terrified in kennels. He was raised with an old person and has NO social skills. He is fearful of meeting people here and only forgets this fear if a ball is produced and then only for seconds. He is fearful of even the nicest dog and sits trembling a they are round him. He has shown fear aggression if caught in a corner and only eats if not watched. He DESPERATELY needs help and we hope a foster home will come forward as this will help this poor fellow greatly. He needs to be in very dog savvy home to help him. He is NOT wild just very unsocialised. He is by donation only.
16-06-12 UPDATE
Spot has been here a few days now, he is now starting to trust us and is not so fearful. He loves my teenage boys more than anything. Spot has had very little contact with the outside world, sadly this has made he very fearful of everything. He's scared of the other dogs and cats and is scared of humans. When he first came here he was a little snappy, as he was so scared and because of this he needs a home with no kids. He bonds better to men - so needs a man in his life. Spot loves to play ball and does need someone around most of the day. He is clean in the house, loves going for walks and is fine in the car - he is, however, a very fussy eater! He is such a lovely little boy, who in time is going be the most loving of dogs and so much fun to have a round. All he needs is some good old TLC. 
26-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Spot is a very special little boy.  He is trying so hard to be brave round the other dogs and has even started to try and play with some of them but I think his perfect home would be as an only dog. We have at long last got him eating dog food, it does have to have pasta and chicken in it, but that's a lot better to what he would only eat. He loves going for a walk and playing in water. I'm very surprised this lovely boy is still waiting for his for ever loving home.

DARCY
BEING FOSTERED IN LAMPETER, CEREDIGION
03-05-12 Darcy is a fabulous 10month old deerhound cross lurcher. He was rescued from the pound but we think he may have lived in a home. He was lucky enough to go straight to one of our fosterers where he walked in like he'd always lived there! He is great with all the other dogs both male and female and range from very small to big. He does need high good fencing, as he loves humans and will go over a fence to say hello to your neighbours! He would go over to chase cats so he does need a cat free and small furies free home. Because of his size we are looking for a home without young kids, unless they have lived with a dog this size before as although he is very gentle and laidback we could easily knock small children over. Dary walks lovely on lead and so far has been clean in the house. He does counter surf so his new owners will have to be prepared to work with this. He loves to cuddle up next to you on the sofa. Please only offer him a home if you have the space for a very tall dog.
08-05-12 UPDATE
Darcy has settled in very well and is a very laid back boy. He loves going for a walk and walks very well on a lead. He meets both people and other dogs well. He is clean in the house and travels well in the car. If you've got a big sofa that could do with a lanky legged friend on it, then fill out that form.
26-05-12 UPDATE
Our lanky legged Darcy is such a fab boy. He does at times think he's a lap dog and does need a home with very high fencing and NO cats in the immediate area. He really needs a home with someone who has experience with Deerhound, lurcher type dogs that have a high chase drive. In the house he is great, he tries to play with the small dogs, but they are still a little unsure of him, which makes them snap at him. Bless him when they snap he runs and hides - he's such a big softie! Yesterday he enjoyed a paddle in the sea. He is great at meeting people and other dogs when out, he would make a great jogging partner. Sadly dogs like Darcy find it very hard to find homes, which is a great shame, as he is just a lush.
11-06-12 UPDATE
If you love lanky, skinny dogs, then you will fall head over hills for Darcy. He loves cuddles and thinks he's a lap dog! He so good with the other dogs and loves playing with Reef a small puppy also being fostered here. He does have a high chase drive around, sheep, cats, rabbits and I would think deer. But he is a joy to walk and he is happy with a half hour walk, or 3 hour walk and would be fine in a town/city area. He just loves people and I do hope someone will give him the chance of a loving home. 
26-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Darcy has come a long way in the last couple of weeks.  His recall (he now has some) has come on really well and he can now go off lead with out disappearing.  He loves water and going for a swim. He does have a sensitive tummy so you do have to be careful what you feed him but he does tell you when he needs to go out. If your life has become boring, then what you need to liven it up is a Darcy, as there is never a dull moment with him around.

ED
 BEING FOSTERED IN WOTTEN-UNDER-EDGE, GLOUCESTERSHIRE
07-06-12 Ed is a 1 year old stunning rough coated blue brindle lurcher. This sweet and gentle fellow is just fabulous, he doesn't react to barking dogs around him and has met cats and horses happily. He is slightly unsure at finding himself in a kennel environment so we hope he isn't waiting too long to find his own home. He walks beautifully on a lead and is just a little superstar!
 26-06-12 UPDATE
  
 
 Ed has been a perfect dog during his time with us. He is excellent on the lead and has no problems with any dogs, people or children he has met . He is very quiet at night and can be left during the day for reasonable periods. This lovely boy is now ready to go to his forever home where he can become a really great companion for the right person.

SCAMP
BEING FOSTERED IN BEXLEY, KENT
08-06-12 Scamp is a 5 year old blue merle lurcher who was unclaimed from the pound. This boy is very special indeed. He walks beautifully on a lead and is very sweet. He has walked past cats with no reaction. He has lived in a home before and we hope that he won't have to wait too long for a wonderful family to call his own.
26-06-12 UPDATE
If you love lurchers or are looking for a well mannered family pet then Scamp is your man. He walks very well on the lead trotting happily by your side, he knows sit and is toilet trained. Scamp also travels brilliantly in the car. He is very laid back and will walk as much as you want him to. Scamp is brilliant with people and loves children. He would love a home where he is the only dog so that he can get all of the attention he really deserves but would live happily with another quiet dog. Scamp does not like to share his home with cats or small furries. Scamp will be loyal and loving and is waiting for your application.

REMEDY
BEING FOSTERED IN BIRKENHEAD, MERSEYSIDE
13-04-12 Remedy was sadly returned from her previous home as her adopter was not well. She has been in foster with us for a few weeks, as she needed an operation on her eyes. Remedy has recovered well and at this point the vet is hopeful she won't have any more problems. She is a very special girl and has a huge fan club wherever she goes, the vets, training classes, my hairdresser, the local cafe her fans will stand and admire her beautiful looks and even lovelier temperament. She gets on well with dogs, both males and females and is happy to snuggle up with the cat. She already knows quite a few commands and is very clean in the house. Although she will need at least one doggie friend, Remedy is very people focused and needs a home with lots of company where she can follow her family around and get fully involved in all aspects of family life and enjoy nice long walks. We have nicknamed her Lulu as she really is a superstar who deserves to live a five star life from now on.

16-05-12 UPDATETE
Remedy is a very special girl and has lots of lovely applications but we haven't find one that is just right for her yet. Not only is she stunning looking but she is loving and clever too. The picture shows her in the park practising today her recall and stay before she does her bronze Good Citizens in a couple of weeks. She loves everything in life people, cats, dogs, children but does love to chase birds. Well she is a cocker after all. She is a pleasure to take out everywhere, she especially likes going out to do home checks for her Many Tears friends and walks beautifully on a lead or off lead when in safe places. Remedy loves people and hates to be apart from her family so will need to have someone that is home with her all day and who will let her share a corner of their bedroom too! Remedy unfortunately has a few health issues which her new family will need to consider. She has a mild heart murmur which at the moment does not affect her at all, but may need treatment in the future. She recently had an operation to remove her extra eyelashes and ones that were curling in on her eyes (entropion). She has recovered very well from this but there is a chance the lashes may re-grow and would have to be removed again. Having sore eyes for so long has also affected her vision a bit but being a spaniel her nose is much more important to everyday life! Remedy also needs to use Optimmune ointment each day for life, as she has a condition called "dry eye" but having seen the difference this makes to her eyes, it's well worth the expense for this special girl. So if you want a constant companion and can afford to take on a high maintenance glamour girl with brains please do get in touch.

 Remedy has been a busy girl recently. She has been enjoying long walks, going to training classes each week and passed her Bronze KC Good Citizens with ease. She is now about to do her Silver KC Good Citizens and loves practicing her training as it involves lots of sausages. We would love a home where she could continue her training as she has great potential. Remedy has been battling a fashion dilemma of late as she couldn't decide whether to grow her hair long, as her blonde wig was so much admired and part of her bouncy glamorous personality, but on the advice from Mike at Classie grooming she has gone for a new summer look and very patiently sat to be handstripped like the glamour girl she is. I have to agree her new look has taken years off her, even if she is too tired to get out of bed to show it off! Remedy is such a happy girl that just wants to be with her people whenever she can and travels in the car well. She is a perfect family dog that loves to join in everything and is slowly getting the hang of chasing balls and retrieving toys. We will miss her so much but want her to be able to find a perfect home with lots of long walks, companionship, doggy friends and somewhere where she will be adored as she deserves.

WITCHIE
BEING FOSTERED IN BERKENHEAD, MERSEYSIDE
 
05-05-12 Witchie is a 5 year old ex-breeding Shih Tzu. She is a very nervous girl who will need to live with another friendly dog to help her come out of her shell and to learn how to live in a home. She is in need of some TLC with kind and patience owners who understand she have never lived in a house and will need to be allowed to adjust to her new life in her own time.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company. They usually get their confidence and learn faster with another dog to copy from. This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up. Please read our information on adopting ex breeding dogs before you apply.

 Witchie has been with us for a week and the change in her confidence over this time is lovely to see. She is a very sweet, easy going girl that deserves a much nicer name! She potters around following and learning from our dogs. Therefore she will need a doggy friend to help her learn quickly in her forever home. She is still timid about being handled but this is improving already and will continue as long as she feels she can trust you not to hurt her. Once she is on your knee she settles and enjoys the attention. She is fine with our teenage boys and is particularly trusting of one of them, but will need a home with older children who can understand her needs. She is doing really well at housetraining, choosing to go out if the door is open, sleeps quietly in a crate at night and is settled if left for a few hours with other dogs for company. If you are prepared to be patient and let this little girl have a few weeks to settle into your home, then you will have a lovely friendly companion.

HAZE
BEING FOSTERED IN BIRKENHEAD, MERSEYSIDE
22-03-12 Haze is a 5 year old ex breeding Yorkie. She is such a lovely little girl. She is not as nervous as some ex breeding dogs, but she will still need another dog to learn from and curl up with. She has never lived in a house before so she will need a patient home who can teach her about house training and how to walk on a lead.

We have been fostering Haze for a couple of weeks and in this time she has started to gain her confidence about home life and people. She is such a pretty little poppet and loves to scurry around the garden investigating for hours. Haze is starting to enjoy an evening cuddle and is trying really hard to be brave, although at the moment she is still easily spooked by loud noises, so would find a quieter home easier to settle in. However this weekend she was brave enough, with the help of her basset mate, to get involved in our gardening project and put up with a drill going right next to her! House training is coming along well, with regular visits out into the garden. We haven't tried her lead walking yet but as she is now more confident with us, she has got it on her list of things to try out this weekend. Despite our basset being 10 times Haze's weight she loves to sleep safely snuggled up in her warm fat belly and follows our dogs around everywhere. She will need a nice little (or even big fat) kind friend to live with as she takes her lead from watching the others and wags her tail so happily whenever she is around them. Haze is completely unbothered by our cat and will put up with being sat on by her! Given a little time, love and patience Haze will make a lovely companion and give her lucky owners a lifetime of joy.

Haze has been with us a little while and it is lovely to see the change in her confidence with people and to see her funny personality develop. She now sings back to me when I chat to her in a silly voice that is very comical. Haze is very easy going and a joy to have around. She is still unsure of sudden noises but this too is improving. She sleeps soundly in her crate at night, can be left for reasonable amounts of time and is very good at toileting outside, although we do still have the odd accident if I don't read her requests. Haze is growing in confidence on a lead and is having a great time running for miles on the beach with our dogs (we use a long line on her). Another dog for friendship and security is essential as Haze loves to meet and greet any dog she sees and since Kay arrived two days ago has not left her side, so they look like one dog most of the time! Haze is developing day by day now and is very attached to me and loves to lie on my knee for a spot of TV in the evening. She really now needs to find her forever home where she can take the steps of her journey and get the attention and love she so deserves. 
26-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Don't think a Yorkie is for you? Neither did I but this little girl has changed my mind about Yorkies and she will do yours too. However if you have already discovered how lovely yorkies are then you won't be able to resit Haze. She has hardly ever barked and the only time you hear from her is when she "talks" back to me with little "woo woo" noises when I chat to her. Haze has been with us a few months and has developed into such an adorable comical companion with a big personality but none of the terrier attitude, preferring to potter around the garden and sit on laps. Haze never showed any interest in our cat, sleeps soundly at night in a crate and can be left for sensible periods of time. Although massively improved she can still startle at sudden noises, so would prefer a calmer home to feel more settled. She will need a least one dog companion but although she is a very petite girl she doesn't mind bigger dogs as long as they are kind to her. Haze is now getting out and about with more confidence and as her lead walking has come on brilliantly so she now enjoys visits to the park and beach. Haze loves other dogs so much that she work tirelessly as a maid for our dogs. She busies herself cleaning their faces, chins and ears and when she has done all that work, she then offers herself as a pillow or blanket to any dog feeling like a snooze, but if she manages to get any time off work, she does enjoy a spot of sunbathing! Please give some thought to Haze as she has come so far and now needs to find her forever home where she can really blossom.

KAY
BEING FOSTERED IN BERKENHEAD, MERSEYSIDE
10-05-12 Kay is a 5 year old long haired Dacs. She is an ex breeding bitch but she is also a little madam! I think she must have at some time been someone's much loved pet as she is not used to kennel life and strongly feels she should be in someone's arms 24/7!! She takes no comfort from the other dogs and at present is crying for yet more attention out in the kennels. Though so confident she does not walk on a lead and will need help. We have no idea if she is house trained either. She is a really beautiful friendly girl and we would consider homing her as an only dog although her new owners would have to understand she needs help to learn about lead walking and possibly house training.

Kay only arrived two days ago and is a different dog to when she was in kennels. She has been such a lovely dog to welcome into our family and is now looking very glamorous with a lovely shiny coat. She is undemanding, happy to potter around the house on her own and although loves to be near her people is very happy to watch life going on from her bed. Kay and Haze my yorkie foster have been glued together since she arrived. Kay is now enjoying sleeping snuggled up with my dogs and is very happy to share beds, affection, treats etc with them all. So at this stage we would now want her to have a little doggie friend for companionship. She loves exploring the garden but will need an extremely secure garden as being a dachshund she can squeeze herself through the smallest space and snip through chicken wire, but only through inquisitiveness! She clearly does seem to understand home life and we have had no accidents and she is generally unperturbed by the noises of family life. However being a quiet girl and very petite for a dachshund a home with older children would be better for her. As yet she hasn't mastered lead walking but I am sure it wont take her long as she does love to follow her people around and in the next few days we will help her to learn the joys of the outside world.
 26-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Kay is continuing to settle into home life and showing more of her playful personality with each day. Kay will walk nicely on a lead for short distances and plays happily with another of our little fosters. Like most dachshunds she likes to chat to you and give her opinion on things, especially on food and being picked up. She is clean and sleeps in a crate at night with no problems. Although she would like to be with you at all times, with doggy company she can be left for short periods of time. Sounds perfect? Kay is a very loving and easy dog to have around apart from one issue, she is a little explorer! Although completely settled into our house just to keep herself amused she likes to climb, jump, dig and squash herself into all sorts of places. She doesn't really wish to escape, as she loves being with her people but she is very small even for a min dachs and very curious so can manage to get herself into trouble. For this reason please only consider Kay if you have a garden that is very secure particularly at a low level.

He will need good fencing, or a home that never lets their dogs out un attended, as has a wonderful jumping ability, though seems to only do this to be with his person.

SABLE
 
 25-06-12Sable is back after 2 weeks in her new home. She is the most beautiful 2 year old collie cross who originally came to Many Tears as the result of a cruelty case. She has had a very hard life but despite everything she is very forgiving. Sable shared her kennel very happily with other dogs at Many Tears and shares her foster home with 5 other dogs with no problems whatsoever. However, her new owners said she was guardy over a bone and their dog and Sadie did not get along. Here in her foster home she will lie in the garden chewing a bone with the other dogs around her and even lying down together chewing. Sable is very scared of men, new noises and sudden movements. She bonds well with the women. She is great with other dogs, loves to play and is quite excited by small dogs. Sable has a huge coat. This needs daily care, not only to keep her clean and her coat healthy but brushing is a very important part of bonding and showing leadership. Like all dogs, Sable needs gentle but firm leading with boundaries put in place from the start. Sable needs a home without small children as she is easily scared and quite a large dog who will flee if she is scared. She is a truly lovely dog with a big personality. She takes time to relax but when she does she is funny, bouncy, active and clever. Do not apply for this dog if it is for her looks. Apply for this dog if you are committed to sharing her journey and prepared to give time and patience.

CHASE McCLOUD
04-05-12 Chase McCloud is a 3 year old Spitz and is a very happy boy. He was found as a stray and no one claimed him so he has come to Many Tears to find his forever home. He walks wonderfully on a lead and loves to be groomed and fussed over. His coat will need a lot of care so he needs a home who are prepared to groom him every day and make sure he coat is kept in good condition. He is very good with other dogs and we would home him with or without other dogs in the home.
20-06-12 UPDATE
Chase McCloud is a very friendly boy who is always happy to see us when we entered his kennel. He is well behaved, he knows how to sit for food and doesn't jump up. He’s always up for a good cuddle and just happy in general. Chase is also great with other dogs – his room mate Beatrix is very bouncy, but Chase doesn’t mind at all. He’s going to make a wonderful, fluffy, companion, and is a very convenient size for those with a shortage of space. Chase is bursting with love and can’t wait to find his forever home.
 25-06-12 UPDATE
 
 
 Well what can we say about this boy. Chase is a very happy chappy who adores people. He would gladly be an only dog as this means he could have all the attention. He hasn't always been the best behaved with other dogs but he does share his kennel with dogs, including some very bouncy ones. We wouldn't like to home him with anything smaller though. Chase was very worried when he first arrived about being touched around the neck, he has now learnt that he wont be hurt and he is happy to be handled. For this reason though, we wouldn't be looking for a home with little children as we think he must have been pulled and tugged at in the past. Chase is a really handsome and playful boy, he is so tolerant and was ever so happy for Vicky to hold him like a baby. All he wanted to do was to snuggle in for cuddles. Chase needs a home with lots of love, he will return it double.

TIGGER
 
05-05-12 Tigger is a 18 month old cross breed. He is very handsome boy who can be a little vocal and bouncy but he absolutely loves a fuss and a cuddle. He does require some training about how to walk on the lead but in the right home with owners who are prepared to put in a little work at training Tigger is going to turn into a wonderful and loving pet and companion.
28-05-12 UPDATE
Tigger really suits his name because he is such a bouncy and happy fella. Tigger needs a home where he can have lots of exercise as he never seems to stop fidgeting. This handsome boy is so gentle with people. If you think you need a Tigger on your life then this boy will certainly fit the bill.
10-06-12 UPDATE
My sister and I went to the play yard to play with Tigger and his friend Pepsi. At first Tigger was very bouncy but as soon as he got to know us he was much calmer and just wanted to play ball with us. Tigger is a very happy dog and he gave me lots of gentle cuddles. When we put him back in his kennel he barked - he didn't mean to sound as though he was being naughty, he just wanted to keep playing and was trying to get us to go back to him. Tigger is great fun and I hope he gets homed soon.

 Tigger is a wonderful fella. I have been starting clicker training with him, he is so intelligent and learns very quickly. Tigger is also very keen to learn although I'm not sure this is just an excuse to be around you! Vicky did a little more clicker training today and we progressed from the sit I taught him to include touch, paw and sit up, all in 10 minutes. Tigger is a real people person, he has been with a variety of dogs and he has been very tolerant. We can't understand why he has been here so long as he really is so lovely. He would love a home where he can continue training and maybe even go to classes as he really enjoys it. In return he will be your friend for life and will fill your home will warmth and energy.

KERMIT
 
05-06-12 Kermit is a 16week old terrier cross puppy. This little boy is a little bit shy but feels much brighter and braver after a lovely cuddle and some fuss. A sweet, sensitive little lad who can't wait to meet his new family. As with all our lovely pups, he will need to attend training classes and be neutered at 6 months. He will need a home full where he will be taken to training classes and get the exercise he will need as he grows. He will need to be neutered at 6 months old.
15-06-12 UPDATE
Kermit is an incredibly smart cookie! This little man could do whatever you ask of him BUT he will need thorough and consistent training. He is very bright and within a few minutes had learnt "sit" and "touch" and "paw" and he is now learning a "wait". He is a busy boy who needs to know the rules from the start but he is such a rewarding pup to train. He wants to please you and if put the effort in, so will he. He would love a job to do. He picked up clicker training in a flash, and I think he would love to try agility or a similar activity when he is older. He would love a home where someone has experience training a clever dog. He MUST attend puppy training classes and have daily mental stimulation and plenty of exercise when he is older.
 25-06-12 UPDATE
 Kermit is such a superstar! He is just so clever and responsive. He is now learning to walk on a lead and harness. Well, what can I say...2 minutes and he had it sussed! He is just so responsive. He keeps checking back with you, looking up to see if he is getting it right! He is so smart that in the wrong hands he could learn bad habits as fast as he learns the good ones so if you want a clever, affectionate, rewarding, delightful, cheeky and special little guy here he is!!

CORKY
20-06-12  Corky was rescued from the pound. He is a good natured dog friendly dog who is keen to please and very happy to be rescued! He is a confident 1 year old Collie who is a beginner on a lead and will need an experienced owner as he needs some training and direction. He is a very handsome boy who would do very well in an active home.
 25-06-12 UPDATE
  
 I took Corky for couple of walks today and yesterday. His instinct is to drag you to all the lovely smells, but simply by stopping, when he pulls and praising when he walks nicely he was walking sensibly in no time. He also walks to heel if you ask him to. I only did that for short bits, since he really likes to check out all the smells. He is not interested in cars at all. Initially he appeared very reserved, perfectly polite and cooperative, just a bit aloof. I went back to his kennel for some grooming, but stood on the squeaky toy by mistake. Corky reacted immediately to the squeak and loved it. He did not bring the toy to me, but was happy to sit for a treat, while I took the toy away and then wait until I released him, before getting the toy back. Today he was immediately more relaxed with me and when I came back the second time he actually wanted to have a cuddle first, even before he got the toy or went to the door to go for a walk. I don’t think he has been taught to bring the toy back, but if you ignore him, he will bounce at you with the toy, to get you back involved in the game. He looks all grown up, but plays like a puppy, once he lets his guard down. He can sit, so has had some training, but doesn’t seem to know fully, what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour. While it is easy to get him to walk nicely on the lead, he is initially unsure about having it put on. He will need calm and consistent handling, but training him will be a joy and very easy, since he is not only keen, he loves toys as well as treats.

DOUGHNUT
02-06-12 Doughnut is a 4 year old collie who was adopted from us as a puppy. He has very sadly had to be returned following a relationship break up. Doughnut is a beautiful dog, he is house trained and walks well on a lead. He gets on well with other dogs but cannot be homed with cats or any other small furries. He is great with people and good with children but would be best in a home where any children are older so 10 or above. Doughnut is looking for an ACTIVE home where he will get the exercise he needs. He is sad and a little confused to find himself in kennels so we are hoping his stay here will be short!
 25-06-12 UPDATE
 
 
  I took Doughnut out for a walk yesterday and quickly understood his name. He is just the sweetest dog. He walks perfectly on a loose lead and did not pull once. We did actually have a cat run towards us and while he was interested, he was easily distracted and never tried to pull towards it, so I don’t think he would be a problem with meeting cats on walks. Every time we had to move to the side and wait for a car to pass he used the opportunity to lean against my legs and get a cuddle. He really snuggles in and looks up with a big soppy grin. He had caught my eye earlier, while he was out in the sand-school playing with this kennelmates, because he seemed to enjoy himself so much. Don’t let the bouncing Collie he is in the kennel fool you: yes, he will need his walks, play time and some activities to keep his mind active, but he is not a manic or pushy Collie. Take him for a walk and see how calm he can be. If I was in a position to have another dog, I would have applied for him straight away.

SOPHIA
 
08-06-12 Sophia is a 1 year old Yorkie cross. She walks nicely on the lead, she is very inquisitive but would love further socialisation. She would happily be an only dog or homed with other as from what we have seen she has been very tolerant and non-reactive to other dogs.

 Hi I'm Sophia, known around here as Little Pocket Rocket. I'm a whizz in the sand school, racing around with my friend Harvey, chasing after tennis balls. I do occasionally let the 2 legged one have it back but only if they throw me another! I am a bit of a bossy boots and like to tell the dogs in the next kennel what I think about them on my way to the sand school, but I'm very nice with Harvey who shares with me. I'm full of character and would like an active home with people who have space for me to run around, and an endless supply of tennis balls of course.

MAX
BEING FOSTERED IN GUILDFORD, SURREY
13-05-12 Max is a 14 month old rotti and a very handsome chap. He is very nervous so he has come straight into foster so that work may start straight away on helping him deal with this. He has come from a home so he can do sit, stay, lay and he can walk nicely on a lead. Max is also house trained and is learning to live with cats as well. This is going well, he will chase but stops when told and then sniffs the cat - there is no nastiness towards the cats. As Max is so nervous he will need a rotti experienced home with fair but firm handling and plenty of patience while he settles in.
24-05-12 UPDATE
Max has been with me for nearly 2weeks and has taken everything in his stride, he has really come out of his self. He loves his walks and is off lead when we get into the woods his recall is a working progress but he will come back with my dog so that at least he can run and burn some energy. Max has been going to visit my vets twice a week as this is something that he worries about so we just take him there, get the nurses to feed him treats which after a minute he really enjoys. Max has been meeting lots of people and he will happily sniff but he is rather hand shy of new people until he gets to know them. He shows a lot less fear with children so I would like to see this big boy (and he is a big boy) with a family. Children over 10 would be better as little ones may get knocked over. Max is getting along nicely with the cats. He likes his bones and chew toys though they don't last long! I would really like to change this boys name to Rodney as he is such a Rodney, he is funny and has a very sweet nature please don't over look him just because he is a rotti, Max will be your best friend if you let him.
 25-06-12 UPDATE
      OMG what a dog! Max has been with us now for about 6 weeks.  Today we met a lady on a horse and she was kind enough to let the dogs sniff her horse.  Max did this nicely then backed away.  When we have met horses on walks he will stand still and wait for me to call him back then sniffs the air as the horse goes by so he shows no aggression toward them which is a plus - in fact he shows no aggression towards anything! He will even go past joggers and bikes with no worries.
      Max does like to play either with toys or other dogs and if the other dog tells him no he will leave it. He is nice and calm in the house and very good with other dogs and cats.  Bigger men do still worry him but if they feed him treats he soon forgets. The only other thing that makes Max worry is the vets,  so we are still going to the vets once a week just to try and help him overcome this and this would need to be carried on in his new home.
      Max is a star, he's been so easy to train and get into a new routine, he can be left for 3 to 4 hours he doesn't chew but I do have toys and bones left down.  He is clean in the house apart form the mess he makes with his toys! Max will need a home with another dog just because having a well balanced dog in the house has helped him make real progress with his confidence and I think that without this he wouldn't have settled and made the progress that he has. So if you think you are the right home for this lovely boy then please fill in his application.

ROSIE
BEING FOSTERED IN ROSS ON WYE, HEREFORSHIRE
18-05-12 Rosie is very sadly back with us. She is a stunning little working cocker. She went to a lovely home. At the home was an adult daughter and a mum who had sadly had a stroke. Rosie loved her people and was delighted with her new home. She was house trained and played ball and seemed so pleased with life. She still had big fears like the monster vacuum cleaner and would jump on her peoples laps for cuddles. Sadly when visitors came she became mistrustful worried and aggressive, showing teeth and snapping. She clearly felt her people needed caring for and the people were a threat to her new home and this also would happen when walking on the street, if someone approached and leant over her. This time now we know better and we see she needs an assertive kind home who are happy to work with a dog that clearly has some insecurities. This is a beautiful dog who here meets and greets all very well, but at her last home was not like this. Please don’t be put off even though she comes with baggage, for this is a lovely confused dog, time and love will be her healer. 
25-06-12 UPDATE
 Super smiley Rosie is a sweet low energy girl, possibly part Sussex spaniel (they can be quite dominant given the chance). She loves walking in the woods, especially paddling in puddles. She is not very bold with strangers and can be possessive of her mum, but has improved greatly. She likes playing with the other dogs and sunbathing/laying by the fire. Rosie would be best in a calm child-free home, with someone who will give her boundaries. Rosie will repay your kindness with more love and cuddles than you could wish for.

TANGO
BEING FOSTERED IN ROSS ON WYE, HERTFORDSHIRE
06-06-12 Tango is about a year old and is a JRT x Pug. He's well rounded and very happy. Has a slightly overshot jaw which gives him a lovely expression to his face. Tango is an extremely friendly boy who loves attention from people. He could easily develop separation anxiety if he was left alone for too long so we are looking for a home where his owners would be around for most of the day. 
25-06-12 UPDATE
 This is the funniest dog I have ever known. Part JRT, part Pug, part Monkey! He's not exactly handsome, but that just adds to his charm. Tango thinks he is a big dog and is totally fearless. He loves everybody and is a mad little bundle of energy. He is fine to be left for a couple of hours with the company of another dog, and only barks now when he is playing with big dogs! He has been clean in the house; pulls a little on the lead but responds well to correction; fine travelling in the car; loves his food. Let Tango put a smile on your face.

ALFIE
RESERVED
BEING FOSTERED IN ROSS ON WYE, HEREFORSHIRE
15-04-12 Alfie is a 1 year old collie cross. He is a charming boy who was given up by a family moving abroad. He was going to have to go to the pound unless someone would help. We were told he used to live with a cat, but with the cats here he seemed keen to chase so we would prefer to home him without cats. He is exceptionally mellow when other dogs jump all over him and he is a very sweet and a true gent. He loves to play and is quite puppyish.
22-05-12 UPDATE
I am cool dude 'IC Alfie' - the IC stands for Ice Cream coz I'm Sweet, Chilled Out and everybody loves me. I really like going for walks and my FoMo (foster mom) says I'm good as my gold eyebrows off the lead. I love chasing a ball or playing with my mates or just chilling in front of the TV. Now, you might not be able to tell from my gorgeous photo (heck I am one handsome hound!) but I'm no tiddler; I stand 22 inches at the shoulder, so if you is lookin' for one of those 'handbag doggies' you is gonna need one BIG handbag for me! And much as I love kids, I admit I would probably knock over little ones. I'm fine with doggies of all sizes coz I love playing, but I'd also be very happy having all the attention for myself, as an only dog. Now, SylVa (she's the Goddess of Many Tears) will tell you that all the doggies on this site deserve a home, and of course, she's right, but if you're looking for The Best, adopt ME. Go on, You're Worth It!
 25-06-12 UPDATE
 Alfie the Oaf is still looking for his Forever Home. Everyone who meets him loves Alfie! He is a sweetheart and lets little Tango (jrt x pug) jump all over him. Playing ball in the garden is his favourite pastime, with a good walk coming a close second. Alfie is very low maintenance, but far from dull!

She will however need to learn to walk on a lead, and need much time and patience helping her her learn about house training and she would learn the quickest with another resident dog.

CASHMERE
BEING FOSTERED IN COPTHORNE, WESTSUSSEX
 
 25-06-12 Cashmere, known as Cash to her friends, is a 3 year old low rider Collie/Springer Spaniel cross, and the most loving dog you could hope to meet. She was rescued by Many Tears about 18 months ago when she was called Jane and was placed with her current family. Unfortunately due to a relationship break up she is seeking a new home. They are very sad to lose her as she is such a wonderful pet with a lovely character. Cash is a very pretty girl with eyes that will melt your heart and she loves to be cuddled!
      She is slightly smaller than you would imagine from a mix of these breeds, as her legs are perhaps a little shorter than you’d expect. Her beautiful black colouring with white smudges add to her good looks. The Collie in her makes her very intelligent while the Springer, gives her, her energy. She gets on well with other dogs and loves to play, she currently lives with Charlie, a male terrier cross that she loves to boss around. She would love a doggy companion but could be an only dog if there is someone around most of the day. She is very good with young children and loves to play with 18 month old Ashton when he comes to visit.
      Cash is used to being at home during the day and is fine left for reasonable periods, as she and Charlie have access to the garden through their own doggy flap. Cash needs plenty of exercise as she loves to run. She is fully house trained and very obedient, her recall is perfect and she is learning to heel well off the lead. If you are looking for a lovely new companion, please apply for her below.

CARA
BEING FOSTERED IN GODALMING, SURREY
 
 25-06-12 Cara is the sweetest and most loving dog it is so sad that she has been returned, her new family loved her very much but there were some jealously issues with the resident dog that they just didn't feel able to address. Outside the dogs got on really well but inside they wanted the same toy or bed, or one wanted to play when the other wanted to sleep so they couldn't agree on anything. Cara is about 2years old, and has just been a fantastic mum to her 8 pups, she is now looking forward to a new home and desperately wants to be someone's special girl. I cannot stress how loving this dog is, she adores people and loves children she is very gentle and kind. Cara is house trained and walks nicely on the lead, she loves her walks and has excellent recall, she travels well in the car, she sleeps quietly all night and is happy to be left although she has always had my dogs for company. Cara has always been good with the other dogs here both in the home and out on walks but she is not brilliant with cats or rabbits and took a while to learn to leave them alone. I suspect she will have to re-learn this in a new environment. Collies prefer an active lifestyle, Cara is active but not manic and settles quietly between walks. She will be the most loyal companion anyone could wish for.

OMAR
BEING FOSTERED IN SOUTHAMPTON, HAMPSHIRE
09-06-12 Omar is a very handsome 2 year old collie cross. He was originally rescued from the pound and has unfortunately been retuned by his adopter but through no fault of his own. The lady was very saddened at having to return him, but it was what was best for Omar. Omar being an only dog in his new home was becoming stressed and not settling. He was also a lot bigger than the lady's previous dog and her home was quite small so he was more aware of every little noise. Omar has been back with me a day and has settled straight away. He is good with children and house trained. He walks on a lead but needs some training as he does pull. He is a friendly happy boy who needs a loving home where he will get the exercise he will need. Omar is a gorgeous boy so please if you think you can offer this dog a loving active home then please apply and come along and see for yourself.
25-06-12 UPDATE 
  
 
 Omar is still awaiting his forever home, and he certainly deserves one. This boy has so much to give and has a cracking personality, he is a real character. He walks lovely on the lead now and loves to play. He is a very affectionate dog and loves nothing more than a good cuddle. He is great in the car and travels well. People who meet Omar really adore him and can’t understand why he hasn’t been adopted. Omars recall is good when out in the parks, but if up in the woods he see’s a Deer or fox he will chase, so this is something that needs to be worked on. If you can offer this boy a nice active home, I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.
LOBELIA
BEING FOSTERED IN READING, BERKSHIRE
04-06-12 Lobelia is one of Duchess's pups and is 5 weeks old. She is a lurcher cross and will be ready to be homed at 7 weeks.

As with all our puppies she will need to go to training classes and will need to be spayed at 6 months old.

RICARDO
BEING FOSTERED IN READING, BERKSHIRE
25-04-12 Ricardo is a 6 year old male Westie. He is an ex stud dog who has never lived in a home before. He is quite timid and a learner on the lead. He will need another dog to live with to help teach him how to live in a home and to help with house training. He is looking for loving and gentle owners who understand that this is a whole new world for him and one he will need time to adjust to.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company. They usually get their confidence and learn faster with another dog to copy from. This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up. Please read our information on adopting ex breeding dogs before you apply.
25-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Ricardo (Ricky) has been with us for two weeks and he has settled very well. He loves a cuddle and being with you, and walks well, but slowly, on the lead. He is clean at night and nearly 100% during the day. He is a little bit wary of sudden movements and would be best homed without small children. He loves going in the car and will settle quietly if left on his own. He is still learning about living in a home and socialisation, and he would love a female dog in the house to encourage him to be more adventurous. If you feel you have the patience and time to help Ricky enjoy himself after years of neglect, please apply for him soon.

ZENA
BEING FOSTERED IN PORTARDAWE, SWANSEA
20-06-12 Zena is a tiny tiny 7month old JRT possibly crossed with a Dachshund. She belonged to a breeder who decided she was too small to breed from. She is a dear little dog who loves cuddles and is very friendly. She is a beginner on a lead and may not have lived in a home before so will need a kind and understanding owner to help her with this and a home with another dog would help her a lot.

 Zena has the tiniest legs you will ever see, she is such a sweetie and although her little legs do slow her down a little she still loves to run around and play. She is learning to walk on a lead and likes to go out with the smaller dogs. She is a real snuggle monster (although she needs a little help up and down off the sofa!!) and loves to cuddle up with our children.

KAYAK
BEING FOSTERED IN PONTARDAWE, SWANSEA
05-06-12 Kayak is a stunning little 16 week old terreir cross pup. He is a dainty but busy little boy who wants to know everything that is going on and loves to be explore. Kayak is a confident little fella who has no fear, just lots of excitement at the thought of having a home to call his own. He will need a home full where he will be taken to training classes and get the exercise he will need as he grows. He will need to be neutered at 6 months old.
25-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Kayak is a friendly and confident puppy. He is very clever and a very quick learner. He is great with other dogs and children. When out on a walk he is very playful, meets other dogs well and has really good recall. He loves to cuddle on the sofa after a walk and is a real sweetie in the house. He would make someone an excellent additional family member and we think he would do really well at agility training.

MERRY
BEING FOSTERED IN BURNLEY, LANCASHIRE
27-01-12 Merry is a 5 year old ex-breeding yorkie. She is very scared at the moment and isn't brave enough to walk on a lead. She hasn't got many teeth so her tongue hangs out but we think this just adds to her charm! This little dog really would love to learn about life as a pet. She will need another dog to help her learn about lead walking and house training and very kind and loving owners who can introduce her to life in a home and the outside world.

22-04-12 UPDATE
Merry has made huge progress in the time she has been with us. She is clean in the house if taken out at regular intervals, loves going for walkies, has excellent recall and loves all other dogs. She travels extremely well, lying quietly on the back seat all the time. She is a very well behaved, quiet and gentle soul. She is still very wary of humans and doesn’t like to be touched but she is learning to relax more and on occasions she will even sit on my knee for a gentle cuddle and some kisses for a few minutes. She now allows me to put on her harness without any fear and will tolerate, to a degree, being gently groomed. There are moments when she forgets her fear and becomes very playful, wiggling, laughing and making excited little noises, and will interact with you as long as you don’t try to touch her! Merry so wants to be loved, you see it in her eyes, she just finds it hard to trust human contact, but in time it will happen and she will one day love to cuddle up with you and accept your affection for her. Merry will definitely need another gentle doggy friend to live with for confidence and comfort, and a quiet, adult home only. If you can give Merry the time, patience and space that she needs to blossom, you will be rewarded with a truly wonderful little girl to love and cherish.
25-06-12 UPDATE 
 Merry has had a haircut and now you can see just what an adorable cutie she really is! Going to the groomers was a scary experience for her, she was so brave and coped much better than expected but only because the groomer we use is very experienced with frightened dogs & allows you to be present to comfort and reassure them. Merry is still very much a project and has a long way to go yet but she is slowly making progress and each step she takes forward is truly rewarding. She is still very wary about being touched and even after all this time I am the only person in the household that she trusts, and then not always. Although Merry has made a lot of progress since being with me she will find it quite traumatic when she goes to a new home and will no doubt take several steps backwards until she builds those bridges of trust again. She needs to be homed with someone who has experience of frightened dogs. Someone who fully understands the time, patience and space that Merry will need to blossom into the most wonderful little girl that I know she truly is.

PRAIRIE
BEING FOSTERED IN FULWOOD, SHEFFIELD
02-05-12 Prairie is a 4yr old ex-breeding Westie. She is nervous at the moment but with TLC she will come out of her shell. At the moment she doesn't know how to walk on a lead but this can be achieved in time. She will need to go to a home with another dog who can teach her how to enjoy being part of a family. She will need to be housetrained. She will sit on your lap and let you stroke and cuddle her. She is friendly and enjoys attention even though she is not used to it. She has a mammary tumour which the vet has looked at and will remove during Prairie's spay operation.

What a brave little girl Prairie is. We call her Pasha and she now comes to you to be loved, her new trick is to lay on her back for a tummy tickle. Prairie sleeps all night, is dry and clean each morning, we are toileting her regularly with just the odd mishap. Prairie is learning quickly that life is good and the big world has lots of exciting things to do, and that hugs and cuddles are enjoyable. Prairie has enjoyed short walks and loves the new smells, she has met other friendly dogs and is getting braver with strangers. The household noises do not faze her and she is my constant shadow helping with the dusting and putting things away (or getting them out again!!). Prairie has had a mammary strip and her wound has healed well, she now has a whole new life in front of her, she is just waiting for her new family to come and find her, this little girl is adorable but will need a family with another dog to continue to show her the ropes. Don't miss out on this chance to share you life this precious gem.
25-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Just to let everyone know I'm still waiting patiently for a lovely new home. My best friend went the other day and it made me feel very sad, she has a wonderful new Mum and a new life and I love my foster Mum but I really want to start my new life. My foster Mum says I am a brave little soldier, I'm not sure what a soldier is but it must be something very special because she says I am. If you are looking for a little girl who loves going for walks and loves sitting on your knee and loves giving kisses and sleeps all night and will let you have a lie in, then that's me, I still get frightened if there is a lot of noise and dogs that are very giddy and the big horse we passed the other day but I just hide behind my foster Mum, that's when I'm a brave little soldier. I go outside to the toilet, I'm not destructive I just have lots to learn and lots of new things to be introduced to. I will need another kind dog to be my best friend and a new family that I can call my own.

TRIXIE NEEDS A HOME WITH TOPS. WE WILL ACCEPT THE ADOPTION FEE FOR ONE & A DONATION FOR THE OTHER.
BEING FOSTERED IN BURNLEY, LANCASHIRE
07-06-12 Trixie is a 2yrold terrier who came in with Tops her brother. They were put into the pound as their owner has been sent to jail. This little lady is very sweet and loves to play with her brother, but when she is taken away from him she becomes very quiet and unsure so we are looking for a home for them together. To help this happen we will accept the full adoption fee for one and a donation for the other.
25-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Tops & Trixie are the most wonderful, ready made family that you could possibly wish for and if you like terrier's I guarantee that you will adore these two . They love each other very much, they play together, cuddle up together, even kiss each other and they are the most well behaved, gentle and loving terrier's that I have ever known. Indoors, they have been 100% clean since the moment they arrived, have excellent dinner manners, are very quiet and happily choose to sleep downstairs at night, cuddled together on the sofa. Outside, they have been great with every dog they have met, have fantastic recall, walk nicely on the lead and unlike most terrier's, have shown no signs of wanting to hunt small furies or chase livestock. They also travel brilliantly, laying on the back seat, good as gold. I honesty can not say anything negative about Tops or Trixie, they truly are wonderful little dogs. The ideal home for them would be fairly quiet and relaxed, where they are not left on their own for too long and with people who like to get outdoors and would give them mini adventures each day. Lots of hugs, love & snuggles on the sofa are a definite must have. Tennis balls & rawhide chews are optional but would be eagerly accepted & very much appreciated.

BEING FOSTERED IN BURNLEY, LANCASHIRE
07-06-12 Tops is a 2 year old gorgeous scruffy terrier type. He was rescued from the pound with his sister Trixie. They had been left to die at the pond as their owner had been sent to prison and there was no one to take care of them. He walks beautifully on the lead he just needs a little time to learn about the world. He would benefit from more socialisation with humans. He is fabulous with other dogs he has met. Tops is a fantastic dog who loves his sister dearly and for this reason we are looking for a home for them together. We will accept the full donation fee for one and a donation for the other in the hope this will help someone offfer them a home as a pair.

HETTY
BEING FOSTERED IN RADSTOCK, BATH
16-04-12 Hetty is a 4 year old female ex-breeding Westie. She is a sweet girl but doesn't know yet how to walk on a lead.

We noticed Hetty was having problems trying to wee - not surprising when you see the size of the stones our vet removed. Since she's had this done she is like a new dog and is much happier. All she needs now is that wonderful forever home.
02-06-12 UPDATE
Hetty is a gentle, nervous little girl. She has been with us for 3 weeks and will still scuttle away or drops to the floor when approached. She finds sudden movements and everyday noises scary. The TV made her vibrate with fear to begin with and a door closing noisily or even the sound of a biscuit tin being rattled can send her off like a rocket through the open back door into the garden where she has several hiding places. However, she has braver moments when she will come lick my hand and enjoy a fuss. In just the last few days I have seen a change in her as she has joined me and/or the other dogs on a sofa and last night for the first time by her own choice but after some pacing she came and settled with my husband, myself and the other dogs in the living room with the TV! Hetty gets on well with our dogs male and female, large and small, she is submissive with them and licks their faces, in the garden she will join in a game of chase with our little terrier. She has been very clean in the house with only a few accidents but our back door has been open a lot with the warm weather and she wanders in and out. Hetty tried a harness on last week, but found the lead a step too far so we will wait till her confidence grows a little more. Hetty needs a home where her new person/people will be sympathetic of her start in life and patient to help her overcome her fears and grow in confidence.
25-06-12 UPDATE
 
 
 Hetty has been doing really well the last few weeks and is now a lot more accepting of every day noises and always wants to be a part of whatever is going on here. She is very sweet and affectionate and the moment I sit down she's up on the sofa next to me wanting to be fussed and and cover me in kisses. My hubby has been away several days this week and she was very excited to see him when he returned. She's discovered toys, is very playful with our dogs and has learnt to walk on a lead, we've been going out to quiet places. Hetty has a sunny personality, but at the moment is still nervous and can be skittish and very humble, however with time and patience I think this little girl will blossom.

This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up.

POET
BEING FOSTERED IN GUILDFORD, SURREY
 
 
22-06-12 Poet is a 1 year old cross breed who is back on the site looking for a new home due to serious illness in her adopter's family. They are mortified at having to rehome her, she has done nothing wrong. Poet is about 2yrs old and is very active. She was quite content as an only dog yet has fitted into our pack very well. She could easily be an only dog again in the right hands. Poet is very active, needs plenty of exercise both physical and mental. She is quite independent on walks and has quite a high hunting drive. She would love to be a running buddy on foot or with a bike. Poet's family worked from home so she is used to having someone with her most of the time. We have left her but she has always got at least one other dog with her. She is not keen on being completely alone as she is not used to this and will bark. I think she would adapt as long as she was fulfilled in every other way, walks, brain work, etc. Poet has been around dog savvy cats but will chase if she gets the chance. Poet is better at meeting other dogs off lead than on lead, this is not unusual but needs to be noted. She can be quite a dominant bitch so a good strong dog would be a great companion for her, though we feel it would be best not to home her with another bitch of a similar age/size/temperament. Poet would be fine with children over 5, she is a bouncer so could easily knock smaller ones over.  Poet is a very affectionate girl and loves to snuggle up on the sofa. She is trainable and clever. Please come and meet our little red girly and give her the chance to settle back in with a new family of her own.

20-06-12 Cheekie is a 6 week old chihauhau pup. He was unwanted and has come to Many Tears to find a new home. Cheekie by name - cheeky by nature! He is a brave little boy who just wants to play and when he is finished he will snuggle into you and have a little nap. He has a sore patch on his neck at the moment which we are treating. He has gone into foster locally where he is living with other dogs, cats and children. Obviously Cheekie is TINY so we are looking for a gentle home where he won't get hurt by accident so a home where any children over 5 would probably be best. Cheekie will need to be neutered by the age of six months and would love to go to training classes.

BILLY WIZZ
RESERVED
12-12-11 It is with great sadness that Billy-Wiz has come back to Many Tears. His adopters loved him dearly and stressed that he is lovely in the home but he is an escape artist. He would be better homed where there is no live-stock or rabbits in the near vicinity as he has a strong prey drive and a real determination to chase. Although he was ok with the horses here, once he got his confidence in the adopters home he did chase them and didn't want to stop. He is high energy and would love a home where there is a very secure field or garden to run around in to his heart's content, with no other animals to distract him. Despite his owner's efforts once outside his recall was non existent. He has so much love to give but needs a lot of patience in the initial weeks/months. We are hopeful that after a few months in a home he will start to settle but he has spent so long in kennels he will have lots and lots of pent up energy. Billy has been living with other dogs but he was a bit of a bully with a smaller dog, especially where food was concerned. Billy would thrive if he had a female, playful, energetic companion of a similar size, or bigger than him! I know the right home is out there for this special boy, please, please apply if you think you've got what it takes to give this boy the life he's never had.

06-03-12 UPDATE
Billy Wizz has been in foster with my family for just over a week now. He has settled in fabulously and is enjoying his home comforts. He sleeps quietly all night and has been clean in the house with only 1 toilet accident. He is very good with other dogs but I think he would prefer to be an only dog. He is brilliant with my young children but he is a little boisterous and may knock them over whilst playing. He travels fine in the car although a bit excitable for the first few minutes and then likes to sit on a seat and look out of the window. His recall has actually been fairly good. He loves his ball and as long as I'm throwing it for him he never really wanders too far from me. He is quite obsessed with his ball and so far has shown that he will ignore anything else going on around him ranging from other people and dogs to a horse walking by. I've no doubt though, if he was to see a rabbit or a deer like most dogs would be off like a shot. All in all Billy Wizz is an absolute babe. He smothers me in sloppy kisses and often just gazes at me almost as if he is the most thankful dog in the whole world for being allowed to share our home and most importantly our big comfy sofa. Billy is loyal and affectionate and would love to be someone's special boy. He may not be the best looking dog in the world but to me and my family he is beautiful and will be our special boy until the right family come along.
16-04-12 UPDATE
Billy has been with me for about a month now. He is loving being part of my family and I truly believe that this boy counts his lucky stars every day, that we are here to love him. Billy has spent most of his short life either in a kennel or as a stray. He is desperate for someone to love him and OMG do we love him. However, Billy really needs a home of his own. He has made progress but still has a long way to go and would benefit from someone on one to one training. His recall has become very "selective" ranging from "I'm busy leave me alone" to "I'Il come back when I dam well please". Please don't be put off by this. He is just enjoying having freedom to run around and enjoy himself. He hasn't done a full blown runner but does tend to disappear out of sight for a few minutes. He isn't for the feint hearted but this gorgeous boy has so much to give. If you are up for a challenge then Billy is the boy for you.
20-06-12 UPDATE
Billy Wizz gives the best snuggles. There must be someone out there who wants to be his snuggle buddy.

GLEBE
BEING FOSTERED IN LLANELLI, CARMARTHENSHIRE
20-06-12  Glebe is a female 3 year old Bichon Frise. This little lovely is quite timid and does not yet know how to walk on a lead. She will need another calm and confident dog in her new home to help her to learn about things like housetraining and to boost her confidence. She is comfortable being handled but will need some time and TLC from her new owners to help her become more confident in her new home.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company.  They usually get their confidence and learn faster with another dog to copy from. This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up.  Please read our information on adopting ex breeding dogs before you apply.

RORY
 
20-06-12  This gorgeous little puppy is Rory. He is a 14 week old Cavipoo (Cavalier cross Poodle) who has come to us to find a home. This little cutie is quite worried at the moment and will need a home where any children are older and with owners who have lots of time and patience to help him be the brave, outgoing pup he would love to be. As with all our pups Rory would need to be neutered at six months of age and attend training classes.

HOPE

She has stunning blue eyes, she is sweet and affectionate. She loves people and is just a real sweetie pie. Hope would love to go to puppy training classes and have a lovely ACTIVE home.

GALA
 
20-06-12   Gala is a beautiful 2 year old ex-breeding Retriever with a wonderful curly coat. This lovely girl is confident and rather strong on the lead at the moment. She is a little unsure at the moment and will benefit from having another confident dog in the house to show her the way and raise her confidence. She would benefit from training and socialisation classes.

GHAY
BEING FOSTERED IN STRATFORD UPON AVON, WARWICKSHIRE
20-06-12   Ghay is an 18 month old ex-breeding retriever. This lovely girl is very unsure and timid at the moment, so will need a lot of time and patience from her new owner. She is sweet and does need to be socialised and shown the big wide world. She does not yet walk on a lead but we will help her with this. She will need a calm and confident dog in her new home to help her settle in and show her how to enjoy her new life.

POPPY

SANDIE
 
20-06-12  Sandie is a 2 year old labrador cross. This is one fantastic, friendly dog! She already knows her name and how to "sit" and "down". She has obviously been very loved once and really is an ideal family dog who could fit in easily in most family situations, although older children would be best as she can jump up and could knock small ones down. She is a total superstar and we hope she isn't waiting in kennels for long.  She shows a keen interest in cats and so  a cat free and one without small furries is needed. We believe Sandie is already spayed and we do not want to put her through an unnecssary operation so if this turns out not to be the case we will spay her free of charge as long as she comes back to Many Tears for this to be done.

JAMIE
 
20-06-12 Jamie is an 8 month old tan terrier cross. He is a very friendly, happy little chappy who is good with other dogs but not dependant on them so would happily be an only dog. He is eager to learn, desperate to please and cannot wait to have a home of his own.

BLACK JACK
20-06-12  Black Jack has never been lucky. He was given to a family where he was just a novelty for 5 minutes and then put outside and forgotten. Now it's time for his luck to change and he's hoping you will bet on him to be your new best friend! He is slightly worried about finding himself here in kennels but we think he will soon settle. He is good with other dogs, very friendly with people and would be happy to be an only dog. He could do with further socialisation and training but he will learn quickly as he is so keen to please.

BEING FOSTERED IN PORTARDAWE, SWANSEA
 
20-06-12 Zena is a tiny tiny 7month old JRT possibly crossed with a Dachshund. She belonged to a breeder who decided she was too small to breed from. She is a dear little dog who loves cuddles and is very friendly. She is a beginner on a lead and may not have lived in a home before so will need a kind and understanding owner to help her with this and a home with another dog would help her a lot.

LILT
10-05-12 Lilt is a 4 year old tri collie who has come to us from the pound. I guess this fella has probably done a bit of work on a farm as he is showing herding behaviour and is probably not suitable to go with younger children as he made try to herd them up! Lilt is underweight at the moment and needs a home where they will help him first gain weight and then be able to maintain it. He is a sweet and tolerant boy and he has had to have all his tail and back dematted as his coat was full of knots and throughout this he was a very good boy. Lilt does seem to be wary of men so he needs a home where he can learn to trust.
02-06-12 UPDATE
Hi, Lilt here
As you can see from my new pictures I'm very good at walking on the lead. I like to stay close to the person on the other end and not pull them along. I'm quite a timid boy but not overly so. I currently share a kennel with Amy and I let her be in charge - anything for a quiet life. I have lived in a kennel with other males and I was well behaved, but I did like to be boss, although not in a nasty way. The staff say I'm a beautiful boy, well it's not for me to say - what do you think? If you could give me a chance of a home please come and see me for yourself. I would be a very loving and devoted companion.
20-06-12 UPDATE
Lilt is a lovely, well behaved boy who is still looking for a home. As you can see he gets along fabulously with other dogs and loves a game of chase. He’s not very interested in toys, but I bet given time, he’ll discover what it means to fetch a ball. He’s really tolerant his room mate, who’s quite bouncy, so he’d make a great addition to a pack. However, being an only dog would give him a chance to come out of his shell a bit more. Lilt just wants someone to love and really just needs that wonderful forever home to come and find him.

LINX
BEING FOSTERED IN PORT TALBOT, WEST GLAMORGAN
12-04-12 Linx is a sweet 6 year old ex breeding shih tzu. She has never been away from the place she was born and this new world is a huge step for her . She is very quiet and worried but gentle and quiet. She does not know about walking on a lead, or about curling up on some kind person's lap but she will learn, with the help of another kind dog, to make you smile and feel pleased you could help her and have her in your life. She is a special girl who is looking for the extra special home who are prepared to help her adjust to this new life and who are prepared to give her all the time she will need.

31-05-12 UPDATE
Linx is still waiting for her forever family to find her. She is such a sweetie and loves her food but has no food issues whatsoever and takes treats gently. She is clean in the house, sleeps downstairs all night without a peep - in fact she hardly barks at all. She thoroughly enjoys her walks and doesn't pull on her harness and travels well in the car and tolerates being bathed and the hairdryer. Linx enjoys sitting next to you on the settee, is great with the cat and gets along with both male and female dogs inside and out of the home. This gorgeous girl is such a pleasure but, as yet, has received no applications! So what are you waiting for hurry or you'll miss out on this little treasure.
98-05-11 UPDATE
It's hard to believe Linx is still waiting for a home. This girl is a complete sweetie. Although she is still timid if you pick her up she will happily snuggle in for a night of TV. Linx is living with male and female dogs and gets along perfectly with all she meets. Without doubt she needs a friendly dog in her new home and she is living alongside a cat who she ignores. Linx is enjoying her walks of at least an hour a day where she enjoys all the smells and meeting new friends. Linx is very clean in the home and sleeps quietly all night, she'll need patient people who will help her along she is a joy to foster.
20-06-12 UPDATE 
 Linx continues to be a fantastic little girl she has been groomed and stood perfectly whilst being clipped and then bathed so she is all ready to meet her forever family.  Where are you?

LEAF
BEING FOSTERED IN PORT TALBOT, WEST GLAMORGAN
12-04-12 Leaf is a 5 year old ex breeding yorkies. Her breeder has been taken ill and has to stay in hospital and her relatives called for us to take her dogs. Leaf is very scared as she had never been away from where she was born and this new world is very foreign and frightening to her. She has had her coat cut very short but this will grow. She will need time and patience and another dog to teach and help her and give her confidence. If you are special and want to help a dear little lost soul please think of her.

01-05-12 UPDATE
Leaf is a beautiful but very scared little dog at the moment so she will need a quiet home with another kind dog to help her find her courage. She enjoys watching the other dogs and pups playing but is not yet ready to join in. She is very clean and sleeps all night in her bed without any noise (in fact I have yet to hear her make any noise at any time ) She likes the look of people but is unsure of what is expected of her. If you try to approach her she will lay down and wait in some trepidation for what is going to happen so at this time I would not like to see her homed with very young children but would be happy if they were older and understand that she will need to take some time to get to know them. She must have another kind and gentle dog to live with as she looks to my dogs for guidance (she is the yorkie in the front of the basket ). With lots of love and patience Leaf will learn to be the perfect pet and will give many years of love to anyone lucky enough to adopt her but at the moment she needs to be given time and understanding and a home with someone who understands scared dogs and will be patient yet not add to her fears by allowing her to "wallow" in them.
20-06-12 UPDATE
  
 Leaf is slowly starting to trust her 2 legged family she is nervous and will shy away but with gentle people she will take a treat and sit next to you on the settee. Leaf is enjoying her daily walks and loves all the dogs we meet.  She travels well in the car, sleeps all night, is very clean in the home and can be left for short periods of time. Leaf is perfect with my cat and my male and female dogs. Leaf will need another friend in her new home to help her with her confidence and people who are around for most of the day she is fine with my eleven year old daughter but small children would frighten her. Leaf needs very special people who are able to help this sweet, trusting little girl.

CANDY-CANE
 BEING FOSTERED IN CARDIGAN, CEREDIGION
 
 
 
 19-06-12 Candy-Cane is a 4 year old lab cross.  She has been returned because her owner has had an amputation and needs nurses to come to the house each day and Candy is not happy with them coming in the house although she is absolutely fine with people she knows.  She is happy to live with other dogs but needs some training when meeting strange dogs on a lead but is fine off lead and will play with others.  She has gone to a foster home and her fosterer has written her write up.
 
 I am Candy's foster mum and if you are looking for the perfect lab cross - she is it. Candy-Cane is loyal, happy and very clever which makes training very easy (tell her once and she gets it straight away).  She already knows sit/lay down, stay, come, leave it, heel, drop (the ball), fetch, back up and more. I have two Rottie's (1 and 7 yrs, male and female), black lab female 10 yrs and two cats and she gets on well with all of them. She has the perfect blend of play energy and calm. She will make an ideal pet for anyone and is the sort of dog you can take anywhere with you as she is good with people, traffic, other animals etc. Candy is a super star and there are no limits to her ability. A fly ball or agility winner in the making. All Candy-Cane wants is someone to love her and give her a forever home and believe me, you will not be disappointed with your choice. So if you have the love and choose this super girl she will be thrilled. Please make her day and choose her.

PEGGY
BEING FOSTERED IN LAMPETER, CEREDIGION
19-03-12 Peggy was rescued from the pound. She is a 3 year old Jack Russell. She was totally shell shocked with being there. She must have once been a loved pet and finding herself in that situation shut her down. She is starting to trust again but at the moment needs time love and patience to get over her experience and love again. Peggy needs an adult only home and would love to be the the centre of attention. She also needs a home with a family experienced with the terrier breed.
22-04-12 UPDATE
 
 
Sweet little Peggy has been here a couple of weeks, she is a true lap dog and just wants to be with you all the time. She gets on great with all the other dogs, but is a little worried when meeting big dogs, so if homed with another dog they do need to be small. She loves to play with the small dogs and has had great fun playing with an 8 week old rotti pup who was also here in foster. She is 95% clean in the house, but not to keen on goingout side on wet, windy days. She walks well on a lead but does try to chase lorries. She has meet cats and when face to face with them is scared of them but would chase them in the garden. She has been to see the vet, as she chases and bites what's left of her tail. If you clap your hands she stops, so we think it's a sociological problem, as she's not doing it so much now. Also when she first arrived at the centre, if you touched her on her right side, she would snap, since here she has only done this twice and we think she may of have had an old injury, as now we can touch it with out a problem. When you go out Peggy will sit in the window (or in a plant pot) watching for you to come home, she is so cute and just wants you to love her.
16-05-12 UPDATE
 
Little Peggy is just the friendliest girl you could wish to meet, she just loves everyone. She loves running around playing with the other dogs, her and George (big boxer X) will play chase round the garden all day if I let them, she is still a little nervous when first meeting really big dogs, but when she's got to know them is fine. She loves kids, but would be best homed with kids over 10, just because she gets very excited round people and is very lickie. She is very good off lead and is not like other terriers, she always stays close, as great recall. I really can't say a bad word about this little girl, and if I win the lotto then I would keep her.
19-06-12 UPDATE 
 
 Dear sweet little Peggy is such a sweetheart, and yet she is still waiting for a loving home. She is so good when out on walks, never running off, meets people and other dogs lovely. Her only down side is her need to chase tractors and lorries. But not every girl perfect.

COOPER
BEING FOSTERED IN GODALMING. SURREY
20-05-12 Copper is one of Cara's pups, he is 7wks old and ready for his own family. Copper has a striking chocolate and white coat and beautiful green eyes. He is a big boy and reminds me of a Clydesdale foal. Copper is one of the biggest and quietest of the litter, he always lets the others test new situations before he joins in. He is very playful, loves people and really snuggles into you when cuddled.
19-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Copper is now fully vaccinated and will be ready to go for walks by the weekend. He is just stunning to look at and looks like he will be quite a big lad once he is fully grown. Copper is very confident and easy going, he loves to play. He comes running when called and can 'sit' on command. He is 99.9% house trained and settles quietly when left. He loves to play and run and adores people, he is good with other dogs and cats and would love to have a family of his own.

SHEBA
 
 
11-05-12 Sheba is a beautiful 8 month old female Lab X who only has half a tail. She originally came to Many Tears when her previous owner could no longer look after her.  She was rehomed but has been returned as her owner has been made redundant. This playful girl loves all the attention and fuss anybody can give her and especially loves her hugs and kisses. She walks well on the lead, but does have a tendency to pull, so she will need a bit of lead training. Sheba comes from a home that also owned a cat and is good with other dogs and children, so she could make the perfect little addition to a loving family. Sheba does have a tendency to cry when she is left alone but her current fosterers say this is improving as she is settling in. If you think you can give Sheba the loving family she deserves please don't hesitate to apply.

BEING FOSTERED IN NEWPORT, GWENT
19-06-12 Hooch is a 20 week old Dog de Bordeaux (dad) cross Old Thyme Bulldog (mum). He is looking for a new home due to the resident dog picking on him. He has been living in his foster home for a week and is a lovely affectionate puppy with no faults to mention. He is good with children, other dogs and is cat safe. For his age he is extremely placid, doesn't chew, he just loves cuddling and sleeping in-between bouts of playing in the garden. His toilet training is coming along really well with only the on the odd accident during the day or overnight. He sleeps through the night without a sound. He LOVES food, will eat anything you offer him which will make training exceptionally easy! If you are looking for a fairly large, ungainly but loveable addition to your family Hooch is your boy!

He is a typical terrier puppy and can be so funny, loving, sweet and gentle when comfortable or with people he trusts (women generally), but he has a terrible fear of men and this sadly makes his behaviour unpredictable and difficult. When Carter arrived at Many Tears he had been completely unsocialised and over the last month or so, he has improved so much, in so many ways, but he is still totally fear driven in certain circumstances and he displays fear aggression towards men. He is house trained and sleeps well through the night, with company. He loves his toys, (especially his squeaky dog) and is keen to show off his tricks. He also loves going out for a walk, but needs careful introduction when meeting other unknown dogs, although once familiar he plays and interacts well with them. He will need a terrier savvy, adult only home and someone who is able to spend time working with his fear of men. He could be an only dog in the right circumstances and is already showing signs of being a very loyal and loving companion, as once he lets you into his heart, he is an absolute treasure.

WALTER
BEING FOSTERED IN CALLINGTON, CORNWALL
04-03-12 Walter is a sweet 4 year old Jack Russell. He has lived on a farm and not lived in a house before so will need help with house training and lead walking etc. He is good with other dogs and will need a home with another as he is very scared and this will help him to settle and learn about being a pet dog much faster. He will need plenty of TLC, time and patience from loving and gentle owners.
18-06-12 UPDATE
Walter or Wally, as he is known affectionately to his pals, is a super little representative of the Jack Russell terrier. He is brilliant with other dogs including male terriers, and is NOT at all a bad JRT boy but a proper little gent. He has learnt an enormous amount and is now looking to humans for attention and fun. He walks gently on the lead and is use to traffic. He is still a little nervous due to his former unkind treatment but is a brilliant and playful companion with his doggie pals. He is kind and loyal and use to male/females of differing size/variety/temperament. For those discerning people who want a calm, companionable, small, but not lap dog, who is now up for walks and fun, Wally is for you. He shows all the good traits of an honest little English terrier. Not snappy or yappy but sturdy and JRTs have an excellent record of longevity. Not experienced with children but he has shown interest in meeting them but can be a little nervous in new situations but is keen to learn and is gentle. Walter is now clean in the house and actively cuddles with his foster mum and is a loyal, tolerant companion. He travels well and is easy to bath, and although he will still jump occasionally this is now more a reflex. He will be an increasingly sensible, fun-loving terrier. He can be left for 1 or 2 hours with a doggy friend and his recall is improving. OK, his one fault is that he snores but even that is easing as he has lost the flab around his neck.
FROM WALLY:
Are you missing out on meeting me because you think it's a long way to find us? We are only an hour from Exeter and quite close to the main holiday routes. I play nicely with my younger foster buddies and respect old Porter, he wants to be boss, so I let him. I sleep in 'til about 7am now and I like a good walk, I can't be bothered to chase cats or birds as Juno does that for me, and I am ok about sheep and good around donkeys. Everyone down here knows what good all rounders we Jack Russells are, so I am trying to spread the word up country that we are healthy, compact and live to a really good age as well as being are up for anything that sounds like fun. If you are a convert and have a Jack already than I am what your other arm is for, the only thing better than one Jack is two.

GEORGE
BEING FOSTERED IN LAMPETER, CEREDIGION 
 
 
18-12-11 George is a sweet 22 month old boxer cross. Sadly he has had a very troubled past and this has left him with much baggage. We originally rescued him from a pound and though he was here for a while he seemed uncomplicated getting on well with all his kennel mates. He went to live with a lovely family on the edge of the cliffs, with wonderful walks all about. His new owners were unable to teach him a good recall so kept him on the lead. In their home he was insecure when meeting visitors both children and adult and growled. His owners sought help but were unable to get George to respond to them like the trainer could and thus retuned him. We walked him straight in with other dogs and have had no trouble but he is clearly a worried fellow and does not always get along with other dog. He will need a very special home. George will chase rabbits and cats and does need training. He is by donation only as he is a dog that will need time love and patience.
18-06-12 UPDATE
 George is the most super dog you could ever wish to meet.  Yes he will bark at you when he first meets you but with in a few minutes he will be laid at your feet. In all my years of fostering, he has been the most well mannered dog I've ever had in the house but sadly I can't say the same when he's out on a walk!  He is lovely to walk when there is nothing around, he has good recall and walks very well on the lead. But as soon as he sees someone or another animal he barks. We are working on this, but where I walk we don't see people. I have taken him down to the beach, where there are people and dogs, we use a spray bottle, clicker and treats, which he responds to very well, so you will need to carry on with this.  He also barks at people and dogs when in the car. George meet a lovely elderly couple at the beach, he was very good sat at their feet, while getting lots of cuddles from them.  I also stood talking to a lady who had a dog with her with one squirt, a firm NO, a click and a treat - George sat next to me while we chatted.   I only had to remind him once to sit still, so we know that he can be good when out, he just needs someone to give him that chance and be firm with him. Fingers crossed I win the lotto, then I can keep him as he is soooo lovely.

ORION
 
17-06-12 This is Orion a 6 month retriever cross. He loves cuddles and has a wonderful temperament but he will need time, love and help so he can blossom into a lovely dog. Orion is one of a litter of 7. They do not walk on the lead and are not house trained but will learn. They are very sweet and have outstanding temperaments but they underweight and will take time to get to the right body weight. They where all extremely patience stood while we bathed them. We don't think they have ever lived indoors and have never been an only dog so will need someone to teach them slowly and carefully to be left although homing them with another dog would help them no end. These are truly special pups who need your help.

DONNA
RESERVED
BEING FOSTERED IN WILTSHIRE
26-04-12 Donna is a very sweet 4 year old cross bred bitch. She is the size of a male collie. She is absolutely gorgeous in nature and very sadly was given up with her 8 puppies who she has cared for and raised with great patience. She would love a home that did not mind that she is just a common black and tan mutt with no amazing pedigree. Donna makes up for this by having a loving heart and kind nature - she is a really lovely dog who anyone would be very lucky to have as part of their family. Donna has has a histiocytoma (a benign skin tumor) removed from her left leg and we do not expect this to cause her any problems in the future.
06-05-12 UPDATE
Donna is a gentle girl with a beautiful, intelligent expression. A devoted mum, she has done a wonderful job in raising 8 happy, playful puppies. I'm sure she must have been a much loved pet once, as she quickly adapted to living in a home and is clean in the house, sleeps quietly through the night, will sit on command and is very gentle when taking treats. Donna loves people and is great with children as she is friendly but calm. She is underweight at the moment and so loves her food but she is an opportunist thief and will counter surf if food is left within reach, although she will stop if told “No!”. Initially too pre-occupied with her pups to want to go for walks, she now enjoys going out for lead walks. She did pull (with excitement) but she is very responsive to commands and she will walk nicely on a loose lead once she understands what is required. Donna is a sensitive girl, who is very eager to please. She thrives on praise and craves affection. She will make a wonderful pet and would love a home where someone is there most of the day. Donna will need plenty of exercise everyday, as she has a long rangy stride, that eats up the ground and she loves to be outside. She may suit someone with an active lifestyle, who wants their dog to accompany them whilst out running or cycling. She would happilly live as an only dog. Can you give this lovely girl the home she deserves? 
17-06-12 UPDATE 
Donna has been staying with me in Wiltshire for a couple of weeks whilst her lovely foster family have been on holiday. What an amazing and beautiful kind natured dog she is. I don't have a single bad word to say about her. She has the most pleading and soulful look to her face which just melts your heart when you spend time with her. She has great recall and loves to run around with my dog. She is calm quiet and very well mannered. She is probably the best behaved dog that I have ever had the pleasure of fostering. Donna doesn't want or need much from life. Someone to love her, snuggle with her, kind words, a warm bed and lots of lovely walks. Could be rehomed with or without other dogs as long as she is the centre of your world she doesn't care. Please don't leave her waiting too long. This girl is truly one in a million.

McGEE

23-05-12 McGee is a 12 week old collie cross terrier, who was rescued from a home with his siblings. They were an unwanted litter. Their father was a collie and their mother a terrier cross. McGee will need an ACTIVE home with someone who has the time to put into this boys training. 
17-06-12 UPDATE
McGee is the boldest of the pups and needs an experienced owner to keep him in check.  He is is very obedient and listens to correction, but I feel he isn't right for a first time dog owner. He is very bright and eager to please and enjoys nothing more than a good romp with his brother or sister!! He is very good on the lead and his recall off the lead is excellent.  He sleeps soundly cuddled up with his brother and sister. His housetraining is coming on fine and he is mastering some obedience. If you have the time to give this very special little dog then apply now!!

ATOM ANT
BEING FOSTERED IN CORSHAM, WILTSHIRE
08-06-12 Atom Ant is a small JR He is 4 years old. he was abandoned on a remote beach. This handsome fellow loves to be cuddled. He is a typical happy, busy terrier, non reactive to the other dogs he is kennelled with. A very special boy. 
17-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Atom Ant (Sweet Pea to us) - eight inches at the shoulder, eight pounds in weight, legs like chicken drumsticks and a very waggy stump of a tail, to call this dog pint-sized would be to exaggerate his stature (but don’t forget that he is still a terrier!). House training is excellent, he is great with small children, greets other dogs politely and is a seriously lovable cuddle monster who craves fuss. This lovely little dog deserves a forever home and a lap to call his own.

DAKARI
BEING FOSTERED IN HAVERFORDWEST, PEMBROKESHIRE
23-05-12 Dakari is a 6 year old ex breeding elkhound. She is very friendly and waggy and appears confident until she is on the lead. Then she goes into melt down mode and flattens. She will need love time and guidance to learn how walking on a lead can be great fun. Dakari would learn quickest watching another dog's actions and living with a confident well trained dog but if someone knew what they were doing with frightened dogs she may be able to live a happy life as an only dog so in the right circumstances we would consider applications for Dakari as an only dog.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company. They usually get their confidence and learn faster with another dog to copy from. This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up. Please read our information on adopting ex breeding dogs before you apply.

 Hello! Wait! Don't scroll past - just take a few moments to read about me please.   Are you looking for a dog that is kind? Gentle? Sweet and loving? Appreciates being stroked and fussed? Good with cats? Great with dogs of all sizes? Fantastic with children? Housetrained? Travels well? Walks beautifully on a lead? Could be an only dog? If you can answer yes to any of those then I hope you are glad that you stopped and read all about me because I tick EVERY one of those boxes! I may not be a pretty colour, I may not fit in a handbag, I might be missing half an ear - but I'm well behaved, I'm fluffy and I am waiting ever so patiently for my new family. If I have ticked all your boxes please fill out an application for me and I won't disappoint you.
 Love n licks
 Dakari
From Dakari's fosterer:
Dakari (Kari to her friends) really is all she says she is. She is practically perfect in every way and we feel very lucky to be fostering her! She isn't as large as she appears to be, she is smaller than a labrador, slightly larger than a spaniel. She is as gentle as can be, wonderful with children and all animals .... if I didn't own the number of dogs that I do then I wouldn't hesitate in keeping her forever.

07-05-12 Foggy is 5 month old weimarana. She was not sold and her breeder felt they would not keep her or her sister to breed as they could not sell the litter they had. She has not been very handled and will need work. Se shies away from your hands but dances to try to get you to take notice of her - coming up kissing you and then rushing away. She will come along fine in the right home but this home needs to be dog savvy and willing to put time and effort into ensuring she will turn out a loving soft obedient friend to all. We will insist she goes to a course of dog training also.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company. They usually get their confidence and learn faster with another dog to copy from. This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up. Please read our information on adopting ex breeding dogs before you apply.

Foggy has been with us for just 5 days but settled in very quickly. No accidents in the house! Not bad going for a young pup! She sleeps in the sitting room over night, with one of my dogs and we don't hear a peep - until the sun comes up, then they both come and stand at the stair gate waiting for me to drag myself out of bed (note to self - must get black out curtains!). From day 2 Foggy has been going out for walks with my dogs, she needs some luring to get the lead on but once on she's as excited as the others about going out. She does tend to prefer walking near the wall but has already been near some fairly heavy traffic with no bad reactions. She has been to the local park, where she's gooed over a lot! She would love to be off lead and running with my dogs but until she is happier to come back to the lead I won't be letting her off. Foggy is quite hand shy, sudden movements startle her. But if you allow her to come to you she will happily be stroked and gives little kisses, and some puppy mouthing. She loves my 11 yr old daughter so I think she will be fine with older, dog savvy children. She's still a bit bouncy for young children. Foggy is an adorable dog who needs sometime to gain confidence but will make a loving pet.
06-06-12 UPDATE
 I can't believe there is no interest in this beautiful girl. She's clean in the house, she is starting to respond to her name and has learnt to sit! Foggy loves to go to the park with her friends and runs off lead with them and now she knows her name she comes back, even on her own. She is still a bit shy with new dogs, but once she has been around them for a couple of minutes she will start to play. She is still a bit mouthy but she is a 'little' pup after all and responds well to "Ah!". If you've love Weimies and want a Little Miss Perfect then you'd better call quick to offer Foggy a home! 
15-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Foggy at home, or in the park with her doggy pals, is growing in confidence and full of the joys of spring. She bounces everywhere and loves to be loved and playing! I suggest you apply for her now before she grows out of the puppy stage - I guarantee she will put a smile on your face every day!

KIZZY
BEING FOSTERED IN STEYNING, WEST SUSSEX
 
 
20-04-12 Kizzy is a 7 month old Jack Russell who has come to from the pound to find a home. She does walk on the lead but is a little timid. She has been fantastic with all the dogs she has met here.
05-05-12 UPDATE
 
Kizzy is a little superstar! She is sociable, playful and has a wonderful loving temperament. Fully house trained and walks ever so nicely on her lead. She sleeps soundly all night and travels very well in the car. She has experienced a wide variety of normal daily sights, sounds and activities and has passed all challenges with flying colours. She has been great with our dogs along with others she has met whilst out and about, she also loves to sit on your lap and soaks up all the attention. Kizzy is an absolute pleasure to foster and she is now looking forward to meeting her new loving forever family.
15-06-12 UPDATE
Kizzy would love a doggie friend in her new home that she can play with and share toys. She will need an active home with lots of exercise and good size garden. Kizzy is still a puppy and would benefit from a terrier savvy owner. She probably never had the opportunity to go to a puppy class but would very much enjoy classes of some kind. She also enjoys physical activities such as running behind mountain bikes and soaks in the enjoyment. Kizzy's recall is good in non rabbit zones. She has not been with us long so until we know her better we will lead walk her in those areas but she is off the lead in the park. Kizzy continues to be a little star!

PHOEBE
14-06-12 Phoebe is a 5 year old scottie who has come to us from a breeder. We have been told that she is quite a dominant girl so may be better homed with larger dogs or a male. She is also said to be good to groom but not good with little furries.  She needs to learn about walking on a lead and this will be much easier with another dog to train her but we would consider homing her as an only dog in the right circumstances.

VALOUR
BEING FOSTERED IN SWINDON, WILTSHIRE
14-06-12 Valour is a 4 year old ex breeding yellow labrador. She is very timid and knows nothing about walking on a lead. She was exceptionally well behaved with the dogs we have put her in with and will need another resident dog to help her with her house training and lead walking. This girl just needs lots of love, patience and time.

CONEY
BEING FOSTERED IN HEDLEY, HAMPSHIRE
22-04-12 Coney is a 10 month old male terrier cross. He has come from a huge group of dogs kept by a hoarder in a shed and is one of the very scared dogs mentioned at the top of the page. He is nervous in new situations and will need another dog for support and companionship and to help him learn. He is by donation only as he is a project dog as has had absolutely no socializing in his short life, until he moved into a foster home. Please only apply if you have the experience and/or the time to give him everything he needs. Coney is not an easy project and although his toilet training is easily managed and he is getting much better at venturing into new places he will continue to need socializing and training. If you want to adopt him you have to be dedicated and vigilant to be able to help him continue with the huge change in his life.
14-06-12 UPDATE
 
 
The way to describe this little lad is happy! He has a real zest for life and now he's been with us for 3 weeks he is confident in his surroundings and he's starting to really enjoy life. He loves to be out and about with us and he now happily jumps up into the car and heads for his crate. He has made a strong bond with one of my own dogs and whatever he does, Coney is happy to follow. We have been taking him out and about on his own and he is slowly but surely improving, but he's much more confident when there's another dog to follow. Last night he met a rescued Rhodesian Ridgeback and they had a great time together. He is bright and intelligent and has already learnt to sit and hand touch and happily jumps up for a treat. He's still concerned about being touched, but no longer bites, or even threatens to bite; such a brave little lad to have come so far in such a short space of time. Coney needs someone with lots of time to spend with him who wants a bright happy and intelligent companion; he really is such a special dog, a big personality in a tiny package!

COOP
BEING FOSTERED IN NEWTON ABBOT, DEVON
20-03-12 Coop is a 5 month old female Crossbreed puppy. She is incredibly sweet and would love to go to training classes to learn more about the world and to meet lots of new dogs. This delightful girl is looking for the chance to find a happy home
14-06-12 UPDATE
 
 
 Hello, my name is Coop. I am a Beagle x Terrier and I am now 8 months old. This is my third day out with the Sensible Dogs pack and my new foster mums.  I have made a few friends already and so far I like Quirky the best.  He is calm, soft, warm and cute, but please don't tell him I said that. I have met a cat called Zig, who lives here to, I wag my tail at her, hoping she will give me some of her yummy food! My new foster mums are teaching me to return to them when they blow the whistle, I then get this yummy doggy sausage, I sooooo love them. I love my walks, I am out all day playing with my friends and meeting new people. I travel well in the van and I sometimes get to sit in the front with my seatbelt on, I feel so special. I love learning and have been told I am a fast learner, so far I have learnt recall in 3 days!!  I know the sit and paw command and I am almost toilet trained. Well, I'm off to bed now as it's been a busy day x.

DENT
BEING FOSTERED IN ABINGSON, OXFORDSHIRE
24-05-12 Dent is a 10 week old terrier cross who has come to us from a home with her two sisters. Unfortunately their mother ran out the house when she was in season and had an unexpected litter. They are all used to living with bigger dogs. Dent is a very cuddly puppy and loves people. She will need a home with someone who has time to give her the training she will need.
14-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Dent has been with us for just over a week. She is a bouncy, full of energy little girl. She gets on well with everyone she has met and is very good with my 4 resident dogs, but she does drive them nuts sometimes. She sleeps all night in her crate, she is beginning to ask to go out into the garden now, so there are very few accidents in the house. When she has been charging round she likes to go to sleep curled up next to me or one of the other dogs. She is very interested in the guinea pigs when they are in their run and has not met any cats yet. The forever home for Dent is an active one, maybe agility or flyball involvement, but definitely a home where she will be occupied a lot of the time and where terriers are understood and it would be nice if there was another dog, one who didn't mind being pulled round by this little girl. She is a lovely little dog and we will miss her when she goes to a forever home.

SYLVIE
BEING FOSTERED IN TEWKESBURY, GLOUCESTERSHIRE
07-06-12 Sylvie is a fabulous 2 year old teeny tiny terrier (probably a Chihuahua cross). She is a very busy girl, loves exploring and is constantly investigating her surroundings. She is very sweet and loves people. She appears to have a very "no fear" attitude. She needs to have her food soaked as she has a very sore throat at the moment.
14-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Sylvie is adorable. She is tiny weighing in at just 3kg's. Sylvie walks nicely on a lead, is 100% house trained and sleeps all night quietly in a crate. She travels well in the car. Sylvie can get a little jealous and growl at my dogs but responds when she is then put on the floor and told no. It is all for show as no fights have ensued. She loves her people and would adore being an only dog but would also be fine with a houseful. At the moment she does need a little TLC when it comes to feeding, which takes a little longer than most dogs, but she is well worth it. Please apply for her soon as otherwise I may never be able to let her go.

JILL
BEING FOSTERED IN FAREHAM, HAMPSHIRE
11-05-12 Jill is a 4 year old ex-breeding Lhasa. She is a dear sweet lady who has never lived in a home before and does not know how to walk on a lead but will learn with time. She will need a resident canine buddy in her new home to help her adjust to her new life and owners who understand that she will need time and patience to learn about lead walking and house training etc.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company.

22-05-12 UPDATE
Jill has come out of herself so much in the last week. She is fantastic with other dogs and plays out in the yard with about 10 other dogs. Jill has now started coming to the front of the kennel for a fuss and she loves her cuddles. I took her out on the harness today with her kennel mate Kaylee and she did really well. She loved sniffing everything and exploring the new world. Jill needs a home with another dog and a person she can shower with all her love.
13-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Jill has been with us for a couple of weeks now and is a real sweetie.  She has mastered toilet training already but does need a little encouragement to go out when it's raining. Jill walks beautifully on a lead, I would describe her as cautious as opposed to nervous when faced with something new but does need some reassurance in a car as she trembles at first but is getting more used to it. Jill is very cuddly and loves to be fussed and will roll on her back for a belly rub as soon as you speak to her but she is no pushover with the other dogs and will always be front of the queue at dinner time! Jill would like to live with another easy going dog who is friendly and not too bossy as Jill is still learning her manners with our dogs and will try and help herself to another dogs dinner if she can. She has a very pretty coat, a gorgeous little face and a lovely character.  She really deserves a very loving home.

LARK
BEING FOSTERED IN YORK, NORTH YORKSHIRE
12-04-12 Lark is a 5 year old ex breeding yorkie. Her breeder has been taken ill and has to stay in hospital and her relatives called for us to take her dogs. She is a sweet little girl, but has never had the chance to be a special little poppet for someone. She would love a new home where there is another dog to teach her and for her to copy. Adopting an ex breeding dog is very rewarding, but it takes time patience and a really dog savvy person to give up the time and love to turn these dear little dogs around. It is not something that happens overnight and you need to be dedicated and understanding.

10-05-12 UPDATE
 Lark has settled in well and is living happily with 5 other dogs both male and female. She walks on a harness and is enjoying her walks, we have let her off lead twice now and she just follows us with the rest of our dogs. Lark travels well in the car and has enjoyed recent trips to the coast. She sleeps quietly next to our bed and she is dry through the night, she is doing very well at house training but not quite 100% yet. Lark is happy to have cuddles and likes to be stroked however she does cower when you go to pick her up but she is gaining more confidence every day. Lark loves her food and has gained some much needed weight, she has bald/thin fur on her body at the moment but this has now started to grow. Lark likes to be with her owner and does cry when left at the moment so someone who is home most of the time would be perfect for her. She is a lovely yorkie and is happy to give you kisses.
13-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Lark's fur has now grown through and she has been clipped so it all blends nicely.  She was very good whilst being clipped and likes to be brushed. Lark is now up to a normal weight, she loves her food and gets excited at meal times. She loves going for a walk and is gaining enough confidence to go and have a sniff although she likes to keep you insight. This little girl grows in confidence daily and is happy to approach for cuddles she will even have a little play fight with me on the sofa. Lark is not yappy and I have only heard her bark a couple of times.

TARA S
 BEING FOSTERED IN CARMARTHENSHIRE
01-06-12 Tara S is an 9 year old staffy who was found on the road run over. She has had to have a severely multiply broken leg amputated and once the council did all this she then needed a place to come so she is now hear looking for a home. She is a sweet poor girl who is micro chipped but sadly her owners did not want her back. She has been fine with the dogs she meets and will need a quiet home - some place that she can just tootle around the garden, be a companion and be loved.
13-06-12 UPDATE 
  
Tara has been with us for just over a week and she is an absolute joy. She sleeps in a crate overnight and her bedding is always dry in the morning and she always lets us know when she wants to go out. Tara can't walk very far but manages a lap around the garden and then lies down in the grass -which she loves to do when the sun is out! She is eating well and getting on well with our male staffie-cross. She isn't interested in the toy we bought for her - all she wants is a lap to lie in and for someone to rub her stomach. She is a lovely girl and is no trouble at all. I think she would love a home where there is someone home all day to give her a bit of fuss and who has a big garden for her to wander around in.

REEF
BEING FOSTERED IN HOLYHEAD, ANGLESEY
16-04-12 Reef is an 8 week old spaniel cross terrier puppy who came to us with her mum Radish and her siblings. Reef has a problem with her back right leg and has been to see specialist who found she is unable to fully extend her stifles which makes her walk a little awkwardly but she is in absolutely no pain. The specialist feels things could improve as she grows and although she will always be bow-legges she is still gorgeous. She is a very special little girl that needs a home where she can be showered in love and learn to trust.
12-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Reef has settled in very well with my large pack.  She is happy to play with any size dog, from a small JR to large Deerhound cross. She has had another x-ray on her back leg, just to doubly make sure all is well and the vet has said it's very strong and should cause her no trouble. She races round like any other pup would and can play all day. Reef walks well on the lead, is clean in the house and sleeps all night. Sadly she is just another black pup, with a funny back leg, so will get over looked, which is a shame as she is soooooo full of love and cuddles.

SHILOH
16-05-12 Shiloh is a 3 year old female GSD. She is the daughter of Indie and Shadow and she very much relies on her mum. She can be parted but will need a home with an existing dog as clearly has never been an only dog. She has not been walked a lot and will a home where they will gradually build up her exercise levels and who are prepared to do some road walking with her as her tendons need tightening up and we hope road walking will help this. She is a sweet girl but she is a little less confident than her parents.
28-05-12 UPDATE
Shiloh is an absolute sweetie, she isn't as toy orientated as her mum. She is however very people orientated and loves to have cuddles. Shiloh has been a bit vocal with strangers so she will need someone to work her through this. She is extremely gentle and just wants to be loved.
10-06-12 UPDATE
 
Shiloh jumped up at me gently to say hello when I went into her kennel. She went straight down when I asked her to and did not jump up again which I thought was very clever of her. Shiloh is a large, very fluffy girl who needs lots of grooming. Shiloh liked playing fetch, but does not give the ball back to you yet. She did keep walking to the gate as though she was waiting for someone to come and take her home which made me a little sad for her - I would love to see her and her mum Shadow in a home together if possible as she would be so happy. She gave me lovely cuddles and is a lovely dog.

12-06-12 UPDATE
Shiloh is a great girl. She’s easily trainable, and walks surprisingly well on a lead. She’s got a load of love to give, just no one to give it to. Given the right training, she’d make a great family dog. She has a wonderful personality, and as said in previous updates, she’s extremely cuddly. It’s unbelievable that this girl hasn’t found a home yet.

SHADOW
16-05-12 Shadow is a 4 year old gentle over weight GSD. She came to us with her husband and daughter. She can be an only dog or homed with others. She is loving friendly and calm. She will need more exercise than she has had and someone who does not mind grooming this lovely dog.
28-05-12 UPDATE
Shadow is such a darling, she is very toy orientated. She will fetch you a toy and paw you gently until you start a game of tug with you. This gorgeous girl will be your best friend if you just give her half a chance.
10-06-12 UPDATE
Shadow is a big girl and SO fluffly! She played fetch and loved to run for the ball but didn't give the ball back. She is so gentle and sweet and absolutely beautiful. She is very sensitive I think and I think she will be a perfect dog when she is in a home.

What a stunnig dog Shadow is and yet we have not had one application for her.  She is very attached to her daughter Shiloh and we would love a home for them together although we are not insisting on this.  Please consider offering Shadow a home.  If you come and meet her we know you will want to adopt her as she is just lovely.

FROLIC
 BEING FOSTERED IN ISLEWORTH, MIDDLESEX
11-06-12 Frolic is a 7 year old ex breeding shih tzu. Frolic has very few teeth which means her tongue hangs out. She is very quiet at the moment and rather subdued. She has never walked on a lead and will need help with house training as she has never been in a home.  She will learn the best from copying another well trained, gentle and home savvy dog. She would so love to be a special dog, and you would be so rewarded watching her learn all about home living.

FENNEL

She is a dear little dog who loves the company of other dogs and will need a home with at least one other friendly and gentle dog already living in the home. She does not know how to walk on a lead and is not house trained as she has never been in a home so will need owners who understand that this will take her some time to learn.  She will make a sweet pet and friend as long as your happy to give her time and patience.

FUSCHIA
BEING FOSTERED IN FARNBOROUGH, HAMPSHIRE
11-06-12  Fuschia is a pretty 4 year old ex breeding bitch shih tzu. She is quite a nervous little girl, who is getting used to being here and will need time to settle in a home. She will need another gentle dog to help her to learn all about home life and walks. She will make a real friend but this takes time and patience so if you have those in abundance please apply for Fushcia.
PLEASE NOTE: We nearly always home ex-breeding dogs where there is ALREADY A RESIDENT DOG living in the house. They have usually never lived in a house before and are only used to canine company.  They usually get their confidence and learn faster with another dog to copy from. This also helps with house training and learning how to walk on a lead. They will make lovely pets but do need a lot of love, time and patience. If the ex breeding dog you are interested in can be an only dog it will say so in its write up.  Please read our information on adopting ex breeding dogs before you apply.

FLOWER

11-06-12 Flower is a 5 year old ex breeding cav. This dear little girl seems to like to be cuddled and talked to and loves other dogs. She has never lived in a home before or walked on a lead but she will soon learn if she gets the chance. She will need a gentle and kind existing dog of a similar size to copy and snuggle with.  Flower has a grade 2 heart murmur which is common in  cavaliers and although she is not on medication at the moment this is something that her new owners will need to keep an eye on.

FALLOW
 BEING FOSTERED IN NR. MELKSHAM, WILTSHIRE
11-06-12 Fallow is a 6 year old ex breeding cav. She is a dear sweet lady who loves the company of other dogs and will need a home with at least one other similar sized and gentle dog. She has never lived in a home or been walked on a lead and although she has been clean in her kennel she has not been house trained as she has never been in a home. She will copy other dogs and given time will blossom and make a wonderful friend.  At the moment Fallow has a skin infection which we are treating with antibiotics and it should clear up quite quickly.  She also has dry eye and will need drops for this for the rest of her life so this is something her adopter must consider before applying.

14-03-12 UPDATE
Ramble has been with me two weeks now and though timid at first she has really come out of her shell. She is friendly and loving and very gentle. She does not like aggression or raised voices and will cower when she encounters this. She is doing well with house training and is eating more slowly. She is a very intelligent girl who is very inquisitive about everything and is going through the stage of everything must be tasted even if it is not edible. She gets on fantastically with all sorts of dogs and loves playing with them. She is actively coming for cuddles and loves snuggling down with you. She is fab on the lead and trots by your side. Her recall is coming on and she is off lead exploring the New Forest. Her fitness levels are low but this will improve with time. She does need to go with other dog/s so that she can continue building her confidence around living in a home. She will add so much to a family and so deserves a family of her own. She is a total angel.
17-05-12 UPDATETE
Ramble aka Little Miss Sunbather, has been with me ten weeks now and is truly a fantastic, energetic, comical, loving girl. She is really living life to the full and loving being a family doggie. She walks brilliantly on the lead and her recall is A1. She bounds along on her walks, her tail wagging and a big grin on her face. She has fallen in love with swimming and is a first rate sunbather, taking out her cushions into the garden and basking in the sun. She will then move around the garden with the sun. Her fitness levels are still improving and she is now at her ideal weight. Ramble loves being part of a pack, playing and snuggling with them and gets on with all sorts of dogs. She is fine to be left for short periods of time. She is now fully housetrained. She is still a little wary of strangers but once you earn her trust she is just the most loving girl ever, she adores playing with you and coming for cuddles and snuggling down on your lap or next to you, giving you a lick. She is such an affectionate girl and has the most enormous soft ears which she loves you stroking. Ramble really deserves to find her forever home she has spent six years breeding and now is really living life to the full. Ramble needs a home with other playful dog/dogs. A relaxed and fairly quiet house, she does not like noisy chaotic environments. and someone who will shower her with love her and continue her training. Ramble is just an adorable girl who has opened her heart and oozes loves and affection.
11-06-12 UPDATE
  
Ramble is still waiting for her forever home.  She is such a lovely dog someone is really missing out on her.  She is excellent off lead and is just such a loving dog she will make a wonderful pet.

MICK
BEING FOSTERED IN SOUTHAMPTON, HAMPSHIRE
04-05-12 Mick is 10 year old collie cross. It is apparent that he not had the easiest of lives as he doesn't know how to walk on the lead and he is quite wary of the world. I would guess that this poor boy has maybe spent most of his life living in an outdoor building. Mick does however like people and he will happily have cuddles from you, if you stop he will poke you with his paw until you start again! He has been out on the harness today and he did really well. He is extremely tolerant of other dogs and doesn't even blink an eyelid when he is bounced all over by Benson. This sweet gentleman needs a quiet home with someone who can teach him all about exciting walks and shower him in love.
11-06-12 UPDATE 
Mick has been with me four weeks now and he is a very traumatised boy who has spent his life ill treated, neglected and unloved by the looks of it. Mick needs time not only to adjust to living in a home but a home that cares and loves him. Mick has found the doggie den in the kitchen where he feels safe and under the window seat in the lounge, occasionally he will come out and lay in the chair or on the carpet. He does like being stroked and he has got well into being massaged twice a day. This is to help him relax as he finds this hard. He gets on well with dogs and again Polo my Collie has taken him under her paws and has got him playing, charging around the garden, it is a fantastic sight, tongues hanging out and tails wagging. The biggest hurdle for Mick at the moment is that he is terrified of open spaces, the back garden is fine as there is a fence but any open space causes him to panic and shake and he wets himself and then he becomes like a statue and is rooted to the spot. So at the moment we are doing lots of sitting in the New Forest by a nice clump of bushes, and slowly he is relaxing and watching the other dogs playing and having fun and he is having the odd sniff. He then belly walks back to the van. Mick often wakes up barking, something has scared him while he is sleeping and he appears very distressed especially as he has wet himself. He needs lots of reassurance and unconditional love. Over the past four weeks Mick has had to deal with huge changes to his life and is slowly responding but it will not be a fast process and needs to be done at his pace. In my eyes Mick is a fantastic boy and in his own way is a loving boy who is experiencing the most magical thing in life to be loved unconditionally. The type of home Mick needs is a very calm and relaxed home.  No children or teenagers. Another dog for company and to help him grow in confidence which is at rock bottom. As time goes on more of his needs will come to light but his new adopters will need a lot of time and patience and understanding.

CAP
BEING FOSTERED IN FAVERSHAM, KENT
15-03-12 Cap is a 10 month old male Collie who has come to us from a farm as he will not work the sheep. He is too interested in chasing and not herding so we suggest a home away from livestock might be best. He is a little timid at the moment but walks well on the lead but will probably need help with house training.
14-04-12 UPDATE
Cap enjoyed some playtime in the sand school this morning and it was a joy to see him running around enthusiastically on rubbery legs just like a puppy. He's quite small and slight for a male collie but has a beautiful personality. He hasn't been heard to bark yet, even when all the other dogs around him get excited and join in, he is so laid back and easy going. Come and meet this lovely boy, he really is special.
07-05-12 UPDATE
Cap has been with us for 2 weeks and has settled into the routine really well. He is people friendly and gets on very well with our dogs, he is very submissive with them, if he over steps the mark they are quick to put him in his place which he accepts with good grace. He appears to have no food issues, sleeps in his crate at night and apart from the first couple of days has been clean. He is now walking really well on the lead. He does not appear to have any basic commands so will need to attend training classes, and he is still only a puppy. He really wants to please you ,so with time and patience he is going to make a fantastic family dog. He loves a fuss but he does not bounce all over you, in fact he does not jump up at you at all. He will need plenty of exercise and stimulation, but he is not a manic collie. He does have a high chase drive but we are working on this, all the time he is focused on the other dogs he is not interested in chasing, so it is a case of channelling those instincts into something positive. He really is a lovely boy.
11-06-12 UPDATE 
This lovely dog just gets better. I can now report that Cap can walk in amongst the chickens, geese and sheep and not bother with them. He still gets a little excited when I am leading the horses in from the field, his 'round up' mode kicks in, but hey, he is a collie and that is what he was bred to do, at least now it is done in a controlled manor. Cap is a soft and gentle soul who just wants to please you. I have been taking him along to agility classes, just to watch. He has been so well behaved, greeting adults, children and all the other dogs so politely. He just adores all other dogs and never causes any trouble. He watches all the activities with great interest and never makes a sound. I will be starting him on some of the equipment soon to see if he likes it. Cap is going to make a great family dog, he just needs a great family to adopt him.

JULIET
BEING FOSTERED IN LAMPETER, CEREDIGION
22-02-12 Juliet is a 4 year old, gentle and small staff. She appears to be dog friendly and obedient. She sits on command and gives her paw and gets on well with her kennel mate Romeo who she arrived with. She has been rescued from the pound at the last minute and very nearly lost her life today but instead is here with the chance of a new life. Can you offer that to her?
27-02-12 UPDATE
Julie is a sweetie. She gets one with dogs of all different sizes and adores humans. She could be homed as an only dog, or with Romeo or any other dogs. As we have no history of her at this time we are looking for a home where any children are over 10. There is absolutely no reason to think she would not be fine with children - far from it - so this may change once she's been here a while and if we can introduce her to younger children just to see if she's happy. She does need a cat free home. Don't judge her on her breed - she is a very special girl.
02-04-12 UPDATE
This is one of the hardest updates I've ever had to write, because I really don't want people to get the wrong idea of this fabulous girl. Juliet is loving, loyal, very obedient, she is great, she gets on great with the other dogs here, which is a very large pack of, big, small, male, female and puppies, she travels well in the car, sleeps all night in a crate, walks beautifully on a lead, clean in the house, knows sit & paw. She is a super dog, but now for the part that will make everyone stop reading. Juliet has food aggression towards other dogs, she also can't be let of lead, because she gets over excited and becomes aggressive to other dogs, she is more than happy to stay on the lead, is not bothered when the other dogs run round her, in fact when out walking she shows no interest in other dogs at all, doesn't even show interest in them if they run up to her. She does get very excited when meeting a new dog in the house, but by keeping things clam she soon settles. She is great with people and very responsive. PLEASE PLEASE don't be put off her because she is not perfect, I can't stress enough how lovely she is.
30-04-12 UPDATE
If poor Juliet wasn't a staffy she would have snapped up along time ago, as she in near on perfect. She is a low energy, fair weather girl who just wants people to love her. Juliet loves to go for a drive in the car and is really well behaved. Juliet is a dog that you can take anywhere, she can go round busy shops to gentle strolls in the country she really does walk perfectly on the lead. There must be someone out there who can this beautiful girl the loving home she deserves.
31-05-12 UPDATE
Juliet was lucky enough to go and see the Olympic torch, she was the best behaved dog around, sat lovely even when kids where waving flags close to her, everyone said how good she was. To end her lovely afternoon she shared our bag of chips on the harbour wall. This is one very special girl, who being any other breed would have been snapped up long ago.
11-06-12 UPDATE 
Juliet came with me at the weekend to help with a collection for Many Tears, she was a total star, she sat lovely letting kids stroke her, one being a toddler. Everyone said how well behaved she was, she got lots of good attention and showed people that staffies are a lovely dog. I'm so proud of her.

MILLIE
 BEING FOSTERED IN IPSWICH, SUFFOLK
 
10-06-12 Millie will be will be 2 years old on 9th July. She is a Lhasa Apso who has originally came in with her mum to find a new home as her owner is elderly and could no longer care for them. She has never been an only dog so we are looking for a home there is another dog. She is not good with cats, rabbits and small pets so she needs a home without these. She is quite a scared little lady who will need extra time and training. Sadly Mille has been returned as she showed fear aggression on the lead when meeting other dogs. Here she is in a kennel with 4 other dogs but is when on the lead that she is worried when she sees a dog she doesn't know. However if handled assertively but kindly she has shown no on lead aggression here at all but we know she did with her last adopter so she will need a kind but knowledgeable home. She is mistrustful of many situations but with the right owner and guidance we are sure she will be a wonderful pet.

PEPSI
 
05-05-12 Pepsi is a 5 year old female ex-breeding Labrador. She can walk on a lead and is very confident and sweet. She never stops wagging her gorgeous Labrador tail.

 My sister and I took Pepsi and Tigger to the play yard to spend a while playing with them. As soon as she saw me Pepsi got very excited and tail was wagging like mad! She loves to play ball. She really enjoyed running after the ball but kept coming back for fuss and cuddles galore. Pepsi is a kind and gentle dog, she is my favourite dog in the kennels today. By Ellie age 11.

BELLOW
BEING FOSTERED IN ROSS ON WYE, HERTFORDSHIRE
 
09-06-12 Bellow is a 2½ year old vey scared springer cross.  He has been left in a garden where he could escape and so did this with another dog. When people were suddenly in front of him confronting him he nipped them. It was not a down and out bite and did not break the skin. This is a very sensitive and scared boy who has completely lost his confidence since we last saw him. This is so not the description we gave then when he originally met and greeted us and seemed ideal for an agility home. We now see a scared boy cowering in the corner with fear. We think he must be missing his owner and are hoping that in a few days he will return to the happy fellow we once knew. He needs a special well fenced home, people who will work with his fears and help him through this very hard time. He will also need a home without cats.  He is by donation only but we are looking for a very special home.

Dade is a stunning beagle who is very gentle. At the moment she is timid and likes the security of her crate. With encouragement of treats she will come to you for a stroke. Dade has not had one accident in the house and one 'suprise' when she grabbed the water bowl and ran with it not realising it was full!! Dade has met all of our dogs and has got on well with them, she will allow us to remove her food bowl without a problem and is yet to show any possessiveness over anything (including her pups who she left my lab babysitting this morning!!).  Dade doesn't like having a lead on but loves running about the garden exploring. When Dade has gained our trust and realised we're not going to hurt her she will make a 'Beagle savvy someone' a perfect pet.
28-05-12 UPDATE
Dade is wonderful. in two days she had gained our trust and now walks beautifully on a lead. Dade is the softest dog we've had the pleasure of fostering. Dade gives up her food bowl and any toys without any possessiveness and allows us to fuss her all over while she is eating (we have limited time to test that!!). As with all Beagles she tries to give the sucked in cheeks 'I'm Starving' look but she isn't although she IS slightly under weight we are building this up slowly. Dade sleeps all through the night, is not destructive and is more than happy to be with our dogs or on her own. Dade is a perfect house mate for anyone looking for a dog, the more treats you carry in your pocket the more loyal she is and will follow you everywhere!! Dade is more than happy to sleep in a crate and is house trained. The pictures don't do her justice.
 09-06-12 UPDATE
 Dade has now weaned her pups and is ready to find a special home of her own. Dade is like a cat walk model on her lead, strutting along with her foster sisters, head held high savouring the oohs and ahs she gets from everyone. Dade is really a stunner. She is scared of men when she FIRST meets them, using biscuits and being quiet and allowing her to come you to this is overcome in roughly less than half an hour. Dade shows this fear by little rumbles but is in no way aggressive, she crawls towards you desperate to make contact and to be cuddled but then dashes backwards until she can get the courage to approach. Her heart, need for food and love soon helps her overcome this and she will allow you to touch and stroke her within a few minutes of meeting. We have a male friend who is in our house everyday and Dade thinks she is his lapdog!! Dade had her first walk along a river side (on a lead) yesterday and she spent as much time sniffing the flowers and taking in the sight of the running water and the feeling the grass beneath her feet as she did walking, it was that 'moment' with fostering when you think it has dawned on a dog that this really IS their new life and it IS freedom and they won't get hurt. Dade has a toy monkey which she loves to carry him every where although you can take if off her with no aggression problems. If she forgets to take him to bed the first thing she does in the morning is run straight to where she left it the night before. Dade is great with our cat and other dogs has shown no reaction towards children but because of fear with loud unexpected noises and movements.   I'm afraid I wouldn't consider rehoming her anywhere with children or teenagers as the slam of a door or unexpected scream could put her back and she currently needs nothing but love (and the odd sharp NO - which always works!!) and gentle calmness. Dade will make the perfect pet given love and a chance to learn to trust you.

Poor Whatsit really needs that special caring person to come and make her theirs.  She had already lost teeth and when we operated we had to remove more.  We have also removed 3 lumps near her mamory glands.  Her new owners will need to monitor this and for this reason Whatsit is by donation.

HARVEY
 
08-06-12  Harvey is a stunning 1 year old Collie x Terrier with a very distinctive half white, half black. He was given up as the owners grandchildren had moved in and as he was not used to living with children, they were worried he might be jealous so gave him up. He is a very busy boy and needs an active home. He would benefit from training classes and would love clicker training or similar as he is a really clever cookie. He can be a little full on with other dogs, he just needs to learn some doggy manners. After he has had an opportunity to burn off some of his energy he will settle for a cuddle.

PAINT
08-06-12 Paint is a 2 year old Shih Tzu who has come to us from a breeder. Paint sadly has problems with her backlegs which we will have x-rayed to see if anything can be done. She gets around well but would prefer a home with no slippery floors, so flooring like laminate would not be ideal. She has wall-eye (a lazy eye) but her sight appears fine and although we were told she may have ulcers the vet has checked both eyes and found none. She is underweight at the moment but she burrows into your arm for security. She does not know how to walk on a lead and has not lived in a house before she will need another dog in the home to teach her about the world and hew environment. She will need lots of TLC but she is a truly special girl.

31-03-12 UPDATE
Poor Realm is one of the most scared little dogs I have ever seen. When she first arrived she would rear up in fear and would snap in fright. This has very slowly improved a little, but she is still absolutely terrified about being touched. Picking her up really frightens her and she would bite if not handled properly – but this is not because she is aggressive, it is just that she is just so scared bless her. She has been clean in the house since day one, she is happy to run in and out on her own as long as I stand well back! She is fantastic with the other dogs and enjoys a good game of chase in the garden with them, and pays no attention at all to the cat. As she is so scared I obviously haven’t tried to walk her yet, but she comfortably wears her harness in preparation for her big day! It is going to be slow progress with Realm, I will not rush her and will let her settle in her own time.
05-05-12 UPDATE
Well I am very pleased to say, Realm has finally decided life is not as bad as she first thought, and is gradually beginning to come out of her shell. She is still very nervous, but will now allow me to go up to her much of the time and gently stroke her and if I am very gentle with her she will allow me to pick her up without the snaps & panics she used to have. She has just started to come up to me and will give little kisses, and will now take treats from my hand. She is trying so hard to be brave bless her. When she is out on her walks (only in private, enclosed paddocks) she has to wear a long line as without this I would not be able to catch her again as she runs away from me – although she will follow behind me like a little sheep. She is totally clean in the house, fantastic with the other dogs and ignores the cat. Realm is looking for a quiet home with at least one other confident dog to be her friend. She would not cope with children either living in the home or regularly visiting. She will still need a lot of time and patience helping her to learn to be a brave girl, she is still very much a work in progress – experience of very nervous dogs would be beneficial.
 08-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Just thought everybody would like to see just how beautiful I am under all that fur! I was a very good girl with the groomer – I was very scared but she was very gentle with me and we did just fine! I am being so brave – I will go up to strangers to say hello, not keen on them stroking me but I am happy to give them a little lick. I love playing with the other dogs, and have no interest in the ginger thing they call the cat. I am good in the home, sleep quietly in my pen at night, only bark at dinner or exciting walkie times – I am just a very good girl. I am still a real scardy girl, but I am trying my hardest to be brave and need an owner who will be patient with me while I am learning and love me just the way I am. Lots of licks & wags, Realm xxx

MELT
BEING FOSTERED IN MILFORD AVON, PEMBROKESHIRE
04-05-12 Melt is a ten month old female terrier cross. She is a lovely excitable girl who enjoys cuddles and kisses. She walks well on the lead, loves having her belly tickled and is very playful. She is altogether a beautiful girl and deserves to find a loving ACTIVE home with people who can give her the exercise she needs together with lots of attention and who be around for her most of the time. 
08-06-12 UPDATE
 
 Well this lovely little girl could melt even the coldest heart. Melt is a fab little dog with not a nasty bone in her body. She gets on well with other dogs in fact she would play all day. We have children 8 and 10 and she really loves them . Melt is your typical terrier mad hatter, with a fab character. She can be nippy when excited but not in a nasty way  so I would not recommend her with very young children, unless they are very dog savvy. Please look at this lovely little girl, you will not be disappointed.

Shelly sniffed a cat nose to nose and turned away, thought she may well chase a cat if it ran.

WILSON
BEING FOSTERED IN BEXLEYHEATH, KENT
27-08-11 Wilson is a poor scared fellow. He is only about 6 months old and probably a collie cross. Having been rescued from the pound he has been in a foster home with dogs cats and kids around until we could collect him. Everything is a worry to him here but he is slowly easing down. He must have had a horribly start in life so he needs a lot of TLC and a very kind, gentle and understanding owner. If you met him you would want to give him just that. He is a sad and lonely boy longing for someone to love. Please have a look at him and if you want to offer a home to a dog in need and who really needs a home Wilson is definitely one of those. He will need a home without cats and owners who are patience, kind and understanding to his needs.
26-09-11 UPDATE
At the moment Wilson is a real project, he arrived petrified of everything from wind rustling through trees to being held by a person – which was really pitiful to see. As you can see from the video clips, after 3 weeks of trust building, love & patience Wilson is making huge progress!! He is starting to learn to trust his handler’s judgement out on walks but is still easily overwhelmed and needs gentle patience & encouragement to avoid shutting down. He is beginning to play with toys, show genuine happiness & excitement and proving to be a real cuddler which truly warms your heart. He will definitely need a home with a confident & friendly pal and is best suited to one without small children. What a superb boy!
Wilson's first day home
02-11-11 UPDATE
Wilson is progressing beautifully! After 6 weeks of gentle training & confidence building, Wilson is finally visibly comfortable & happy to be around us. He is clean in the house (although won’t ask to go out so does need regular accompanied visits outside). He is crate trained during the night and sleeps soundly until the morning. He is growing to enjoy his walks in our local park & has made an incredibly amount of friends of the 2 legged kind as well as 4. He’s a gentle, well-mannered chap who ideally needs a Collie experienced home. He is nowhere near coming off a training line as he is still extremely jumpy and easily spooked (especially of sudden or load noises). He’s such a joy to have around and is waiting for his special home.
13-02-12 UPDATE
What a clever lad...Wilson has come such a long way but being the project that he is, he has so much more to give - he just needs the right home. When he trusts his handler, he thoroughly enjoys his walks & will jump in and out of the car, however, he is still very weary outside and often picks up on the faintest of sounds before you even realise what he is reacting to. He is incredibly relaxed & settled within the home but it has taken several weeks of trust building. He is hesitant meeting new people but with the correct direction he is slowly overcoming this. He still hits a wall of panic with sudden loud noises/gun shots/children screaming & shouting and even raised voices.
