Does it matter whether you get a diagnosis of disability for your child or not?
Not having a diagnosis may matter very much to you as a parent and it may matter to your child as they get older, so they can understand why they can't walk or see or have an impairment. However, for many practical purposes, it doesn't make any difference whether you have a diagnosis or not. This is because:
Treatment, therapy or teaching should be tailored to your child's needs, not to the name of their condition.
You're entitled to have a social services assessment of your child's needs and of your needs as a parent or carer, whether your child has a named diagnosis or not.
You're entitled to receive benefits such as Disability Living Allowance on the basis of the difficulties that your child has and the support they need. Entitlement does not dependon being able to name the disorder your child has.
Your child is entitled to have an extra or different support to help them at school, if they need it. This does not depend on knowing the cause of their learning difficulties.

Where can I get support if I don't know why my child needs help?
Many areas in the UK have a local parents' support group where families' of children with all kinds of disabilities come together for mutual support and contact. It might be helpful to find out if there's one near you. Even if you had a diagnosis, it's unlikely that another child in the group would have the same condition. However, a lot of issues you face on a day-to-day basis will be familiar to other parents and they often have practical advice to share. Local groups have the advantage of meeting regularly and locally, which can be important in providing a support network, if you need one. Another advantage is that other members can pass on information about support and services that are available in your area and that they have already used.

Why Is It So Hard to Get a Diagnosis for Disabilities?
There are many things that can cause disability in a child. Difficulties during pregnancy, prematurity, genetic conditions or trauma during birth itself can all be relevant. In some cases it's impossible to single out a specific cause - especially where children have a range of health problems that do not fit easily into any known syndrome. A syndrome is a characteristic pattern, or group of symptoms, which often appear in combination with one another.
Some children have a rare disorder, which may only affect a handful of other children across the country or perhaps none at all. It's harder for doctors to diagnose a condition they've never seen before, and where there are very few studies which would make it possible to compare the features of your child's difficulties with other cases. Many conditions have quite similar features and symptoms, which can also make it hard to be specific about your child's particular condition.
Soem features may not appear until your child id older, when it will become more obvious that they are affected by a particular syndrome or disorder. More and more syndromes are being discovered each year, so it may be that a diagnosis will be achieved for your child in the future, even if it does not seem to be possible now.
If you feel strongly that all avenues to getting a diagnosis have not been explored, you should certainly discuss this with your child's doctor and request a second opinion. But sometimes everything that can be done has been done and you are still left with no diagnosis.

How can I get a tax credit decision changed?
The revenue can revise a decision if there is a change of circumstances, if they have made a mistake or if they think your award is wrong. If you disagree with their decision you can appeal. The time limit for appealing is 30 days from the date of the decision. An appeal must be in writing and must say why you are appealing. Appeals can be made on form TC623, found at the leaflet ATC/AP available from the Revenue. Unless you are reporting a change of circumstances it is usually better to ask for an appeal rather than a revision. This is because the appeal deadline of 30 days is not extended if you ask for a revision and it is turned down. Late appeals are sometimes possible up to one year and 30 days after a decision. But a late appeal is only granted in 'special circumstances', so you should always try and make sure that you meet the normal appeal deadline.
For more information please telephone 0845 300 3900 (Textphone 0845 300 3909) Lines are open from 8am-8pm seven days a week.
Why should I talk to my son/daughter about sex?
Young people are starting to have sex younger and younger. Don't assume that this won't happen to your teenager. By the time you see the warning signs it may be too late to give them the help they need. Make sure they learn about sex early on.

My child has been skipping school, how do I know he/she is at school?
Notice what times your child is around, if they should be in school and check up if they say school has allowed them out. You may not even know until you are told by the school or Police.
Find out why your child is missing school and talk about any problems such as bullying or fear of failure. Discuss what your child wants for their future and how to reach short-term goals. If you take an active interest in their education they are more likely to talk to you when problems arise.

How can I get my teenager to talk to me more?
The teenage years are tough for your child, so try to understand what they are going through. Accept that friendships, music, their own opinions and most other things are more important that you right now! Despite this, knowing that you are there for them, gives your teenager the confidence to try new things.
