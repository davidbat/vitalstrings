Adoption Travel
Some of the common and most popular international adoption programs are China, Guatemala, Russia and Korea, but that changes as laws, policies and requirements change, both here in the U.S. and also in the country of origin. Some upcoming changes, which will impact international adoption, is the United States' ratification of The Hague Treaty on Inter-Country Adoptions. This treaty, once ratified, hopes to ensure ethical adoption practices, which means that adopting parents can be sure that the rights of everyone involved are being considered.
In order to adopt internationally, you must meet certain minimum standards, as defined by the U.S. Government. Check out the Restrictions & Requirements section for more information.
International adoption is a wonderful and exciting journey towards parenthood. Good luck on your journey!
