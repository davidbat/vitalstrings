The Vatican City already uses Euros as its currency and has done for a few years by special agreement with the EU. I'm sure it could apply to join the EU as a member state, but they would never do that given their special religious nature; by joining they would be agreeing to be bound by European Union law as agreed in the European Parliament and administered by the European Court of Justice and its various branches, and agreeing that these laws supersede their own laws, ie. those laid down by the Pope, God's representative on earth... I can't see them agreeing to that! It would be granting the legislators in Brussels the power to override God, at least that is how the Vatican administration would view it!
So, yes in theory, but pigs will fly before it is even considered as a possibility!
