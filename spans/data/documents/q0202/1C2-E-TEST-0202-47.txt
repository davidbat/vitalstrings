The Greek financial turmoil could postpone admission of emerging European countries into the eurozone, according to a poll by Reuters among 44 leading analysts.
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Poland could adopt the single currency in 2015, with Estonia standing the best chances, expected to lead the pack in 2011.
In autumn 2009, analysts predicted the Baltic country would adopt the euro in 2012.
European policymakers will measure euro aspirants against the Maastricht adoption criteria with a new intensity, according to the poll.
"The euro zone countries will want to be absolutely sure that they are not bringing a new 'Greece' to the club," said Diego Iscaro, economist with Ihs Global Insight.
Other analysts say it is not a matter of who will join the club but who will pack up and leave.
The poll showed that only Estonia will stick to its guns to join the eurozone after finance minister Jurgen Ligi last week announced he expects the country will adopt the euro in 2011.
The analysts singled out keeping budget deficit beneath the three per cent cap as the toughest challenge facing aspirants.
Poland, the region’s best performer, run up a shortfall of 7.2 per cent of GDP, jeopardising the government’s ERM-II target of 2012.
The most daunting challenge facing Bulgaria and Romania is reining in inflation.
