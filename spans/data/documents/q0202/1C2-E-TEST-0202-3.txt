For the simple reason that when Gordon Brown was Chancellor, he decided that we did not fulfill his "strict fiscal rules" and it`s the only thing he did right in all his terms of office as that and P.M.
NB. When the €uro was first proposed, there were "Strict Rules" governing the ability of a country, to join the "Common European Currency" National Debt Vs GDP %age etc. and at that time, only 3 (three) countries conformed to those rules, they were; Germany, United Kingdom and Norway. All the others "cooked the books", moved a decimal point or two to make it appear that their economies were thriving..
Take a look at them now  Italy, virtually bankrupt, Spain ditto, Portugal same story, Ireland (The EU forced Eire to have a second referendum to join the €uro) same old story, ~Greece even worse.
Even a blind man could see that trying to get all those different, disparate economies, using the same currency, without the same fiscal policy on taxes, would fail
