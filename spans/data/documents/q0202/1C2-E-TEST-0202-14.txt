Why does the UK not use the euro?
In: Personal Finance [ Edit categories ]
Answer:
The Conservative government under John Major decided to not participate in the first group of countries that joined the Euro.
The Labour party when it came to power in 1997 promised to have a referendum and participate when the economic conditions were met. The Euro has now slipped off of the political agenda in the UK, it is believed that the current Prime Minister, Gordon Brown is opposed to the UK joining the Euro.
The UK has not joined the Euro because a number of economic conditions were not in synch with the rest of the Eurozone. In order words, the British economy is 'out of synch' with that of the Eurozone.
Moreover, there is a lot of hostility in the UK to the European Union.
