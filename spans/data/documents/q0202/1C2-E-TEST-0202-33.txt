Its the currency that we have used for hundreds of years. The Euro is a new currency and most people in the UK are against it being used here. Its part of our national identity.
The UK will have no control of setting interest rates. Currently, the Bank of England has control of setting interest rates. So it will be set based on what is good for the country. If the UK adopted the Euro, the European Central Bank will have the control of setting interest rates. This can benefit some countries that use the Euro and be bad for others.
And why change if the pound is working well? Its not like we are having a hyper inflation crisis. And even if we was, I would still be against the Euro because we would have no control of setting interest rates.
If one country in the Eurozone is collapsing (Greece) then others who have a stable economy may also collapse. That’s why Germany pumped in billions to stop Greece from collapsing. It would’ve affect them and the rest of the Eurozone. I think France pumped in some, but Germnay pumped in the most.
The Euro is one big failure. The pound has never failed us, lets keep it.

Because we’re fiercely independent! Plus the pound is worth more than the euro so why would we want to get the euro? We’re part of the european union but we kind of do our own thing cos we’re arrogant like that…
If they tried to get us to swap to the euro there’d be a massive protest
