General
What is it?
A.
The euro is the name given to the single currency of the European Union. The euro was established as a currency in 1999 and          gradually moved into general use, with the introduction of coins and notes in 2002. For more         information see the Euro Web site run by the European Commission.
Should the word 'euro' be capitalized? Is the plural form 'euro' or 'euros'?
A.
The form varies depending on the language. In English, 'euro' and 'cent' should not         be capitalized, and the plural forms should not include an 's' in official documents.
What does the symbol look like, and how was it chosen?
A.
According to the information posted on the euro Web site, about thirty draft         designs were drawn up internally by the European Commission. The general public         assessed ten designs, narrowing the shortlist to two. Jacques Santer, president         of the European Commission, and Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European         commissioner in charge of the euro, chose the final design.

Why do the symbols shown above look different from the one posted on the official euro site?
A.
We have chosen to make instances of the euro symbol font- and style-specific. The         design of the symbol takes on the characteristics of the font in which it resides.
Traditionally, numerals and currency symbols are the same width for any given         font. This helps values line up properly in tabular applications like         spreadsheets. To make the euro symbol the correct width for Arial and Times New         Roman, it had to be condensed.
