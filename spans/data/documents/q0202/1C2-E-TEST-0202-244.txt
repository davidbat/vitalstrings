EuroMillions
Euro Millions is a European lottery that takes place twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday evenings. Whereas national lotteries are generally limited to the residents of one particular country, the Euro Millions lottery pools the stakes of the participating European countries. This obviously makes the prizes a great deal larger than in national lotteries even in normal circumstances. But because the main prize pool is “rolled over” to the next draw if there is no jackpot winner, prizes can - after a few weeks without a winner - be as high as 190 million Euros.

The history of Euro Millions began in 1994. Originally, the idea had been to launch this new Euro Lottery at around the same time as a single European currency, but as often happens, bureaucracy, politics and other miscellaneous factors meant that the plan was   delayed a number of times before coming to fruition some ten years later.
The first Euro Millions   lottery draw took place on Friday 13th February, 2004. It was originally presented by   three major lottery organisers: Camelot in the United Kingdom who run the UK National Lottery , Francaise des   Jeux in France and the Loterias y Apuestas des Estad in Spain. The first jackpot   was worth 15 million Euros. The largest euromillions winners are listed here.
