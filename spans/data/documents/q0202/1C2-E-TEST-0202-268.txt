 
 
For many of you who have contacted me about their dogs fighting, you will know that I send out a piece called ‘fighting dogs' which recommends the use of a CO2 fire extinguisher as a training aid. It stops fighting immediately and ultimately becomes a deterrent to aggression starting again. So often I have thought that what we really need is a pocket size extinguisher for out walking etc…and then I discovered
‘THE PET CORRECTOR'.
This amazing, easy to use and reliable aid to training your dog, can now be purchased directly from Shar Pei Rescue and Welfare UK.
50ml £6.75 plus £1.99 p&p or the larger 200ml £10.99 p&p £2.99.
(at present we only have the larger size)
Please send postal order or cheque made out to: SPRW UK to Five Levels Cottage, Burrow wall, Burrowbridge, Somerset, TA70JQ
 
PLEASE remember, we can not return calls to mobiles !
 
Most rescue dogs have problems of some sort...
Is YOUR heart big and patient enough to take one of these dogs on ?
===============================================
THINK BEFORE YOU BUY...
In recent months more and more dogs are coming in to us with varying hereditary problems. ALL of these dogs come with Kennel club registrations and none would be accepted back by the breeder.
The average price paid for these dogs was £800.00.
It is important that the buyer realise that having a kennel club registration is no guarantee of the health or temperament of a dog.
The Kennel Club is a business. It is NOT a welfare organisation. Breeders are NOT checked. NO BODY visits to see what conditions the dogs are kept in. ANYBODY can register a litter with the Kennel Club if they are prepared to pay to do so. The Kennel Club have no powers to prevent irresponsible breeding. Registration only means that you can show your dog in the show ring; it is NOT a guarantee as to the well being of a pup.
The recent case in the media of over 200 starving, dehydrated Yorkshire Terriers kept in a windowless shed in the most appalling conditions, only found when the 'breeder' died, is testament to this, as was a similar situation with a Labrador breeder last year.
Both Breeders were KC registered!
If you want to buy a puppy, there are certain things you should ask and see before you even consider parting with your cash.
Ask to see BOTH parents. If a dog was brought in for stud ask for the name of the stud dog and make contact with the owner. If the dog shows aggression to you, do NOT buy the pup.
Ask to see the full litter with its mum. Check that the bitch is looking healthy and is comfortable with you visiting her young and that the litter looks healthy.
You have the right to choose your puppy. Make sure the pup you choose is bright, sociable, interested in its surroundings and playful.
Do not take a pup that has mucky eyes, a snotty nose or is listless.
Ask about hereditary conditions such as Amyloidosis, Shar Pei fever, swollen hock syndrome and Demodectic mange. If necessary get the breeder to put in writing that, to the best of their knowledge that neither the Dam nor the Sire carries any of these conditions.
Ask if, in the event of a serious health or temperament problem, they will take the puppy back?
Ask if you can contact owners of puppies previously bred by the breeder, to attest to the temperaments and health of the dogs that have been bred.
Take your new puppy to your vet within the first few days and have it checked.
 
By following these simple steps, you will help to reduce the number of dogs that are given up to rescues
 
A good breeder will vet you thoroughly; you have the right to do the same.
==================================================
We are hearing more and more often of dogs being stolen. It is a cruel and heartbreaking trend.
To help protect your dog, get it microchipped and Neutered.
A neutered animal CAN NOT be stolen for puppy farming and helps protect your pet.
If you ALWAYS have a collar on your dogs with a tag stating that they are neutered, they are less likely to be stolen.
============================
Please do not ask us to return calls to a mobile.
We rely solely on donation and can not afford huge telephone bills.
THANK YOU
Please register for adoption or fostering.
You will find the forms to download on our ' please help' page.
Please Do it today
=======================================
Our Organisation asks for a ten pound registration fee before people go on the   list to adopt a dog.
WHY?
Well, a lot of our dogs  come to us with various health problems and many need operations. It would be  unfair of us to knowingly allow someone to adopt a dog, aware that it should  undergo surgery.
The registration fee means there is always some money available.
The other monies we rely upon is Donation, but sadly we have discovered that some people, once receiving a rescue dog from us, just don't  want to cough up!
It is very strange that these same people, when  asked why a donation isn't forthcoming, nearly always become abusive and  nasty???
They don't care that without the donations, we  would eventually be unable to rescue any more dogs.
It's a case of 'I've got my dog, who cares about  the rest?'
WELL  WE DO !
Please, when you apply to adopt you must not only  take into consideration the yearly jabs, dog food, insurance etc; but also that  you WILL be expected to give a reasonable donation. Most other 'rescue' organisations CHARGE you for an animal.
We  Don't..So don't let us down...Please.
 
Please contact Roma if you can help. See our " Please Help " section for   details and forms.
=========================================
How can you help?
Well there are several ways. You can help by letting us know when a dog is in need. You can help us transport animals. You can help us raise funds. You can help us by giving your time and expertise about the breed.
There are so many ways you can help and we too can help you. We will find good loving homes, We will take responsibility for veterinary care for fostered dogs, (where funds are available) We will make the phone calls, co-ordinate the rescue, find understanding foster homes for behavioural problems so they can be re-trained and we will make sure these wonderful sensitive dogs get homed with people who will love them for the rest of their lives.
We have no committees. No axes to grind. No politics. We just CARE. Please feel free to contact us with any enquiries. We look forward to hearing from anyone interested in helping us.
