The cost of adoption will vary by the type of adoption being considered and the fees attached. Adoption costs vary due to, for example, agency and lawyer fees, travel costs, and birth family needs.  Adoption costs range from zero with state adoptions to over $30,000 with domestic private or independent adoptions.
