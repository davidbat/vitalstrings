Down’s syndrome
Down’s syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder, affecting one person in every 1000, and it is one of the most common causes of learning difficulties. The severity with which a person will be affected varies, but there will usually be some health problems, developmental delay and distinctive facial features. Down’s syndrome occurs across all ethnic groups and in both genders. With suitable treatment and support, average life expectancy is about 60 years.

Drug withdrawal symptoms / treatment for drug withdrawal
Most drugs that are taken during pregnancy will pass through the placenta (afterbirth) and enter a baby’s blood supply. A newborn whose mother used drugs during pregnancy may therefore need to remain in hospital for a short while – usually five to ten days – to be monitored for drug withdrawal symptoms, which can occur hours or days after birth.
The nature and severity of the symptoms really do depend on a whole host of factors, such as the type of substance used and the frequency, as well as the child’s level of dependency. However, symptoms often include difficulties with feeding, irritability, tremors, diarrhoea and vomiting. The baby may also have been born prematurely as a result of the drug use, and have corresponding low birth weight and growth.
If a baby experiences drug withdrawal symptoms, the hospital will administer suitable treatment, which involves ‘weaning’ the baby off the drug: for example, giving them small amounts of a safe form of the drug until they no longer need it.
Once discharged from hospital, there may still be lingering symptoms. The baby may also seem generally fraught and require a lot of patience and tender care. However, symptoms do improve with time.
In the long term, there may remain some uncertainty about the baby’s future development . As a result, babies who have experienced drug withdrawal symptoms should be monitored by health and social care professionals as they grow.

Dyslexia
Dyslexia is a condition that mainly affects reading, writing and spelling.
Although considered a learning difficulty, people at every level of intellectual development can have dyslexia. It is believed to be hereditary and to be caused by irregularities in the area of the brain that deals with language.
The symptoms of dyslexia will be a little different for every person, and usually become apparent early on. Toddlers may have speech and language delay and perhaps show difficulty with keeping rhythm or dressing themselves. However, dyslexia is usually diagnosed later in childhood, once the child is at school, through screening tests and a dyslexia assessment.
Once dyslexia is confirmed, the child will usually require some specialist teaching, irrespective of whether they are in mainstream or special school. Their carers can also help them by encouraging their reading and writing in a patient, positive way, and acknowledging their strengths in other areas, such as verbal, social or lateral skills.

Dysmorphic features
A dysmorphic feature is any bodily feature considered by medical professionals to be abnormally formed. To be deemed ‘dysmorphic’, the irregularity of the feature will usually be fairly pronounced, even if it may not always be noticeable or observed.
A dysmorphic feature can be a stand-alone birth defect, but it sometimes suggests an underlying disorder or syndrome. An example of this is the identifiable facial features of a child with Down’s syndrome , such as a flat facial profile and almond-shaped eyes.

Dyspraxia
Dyspraxia is a condition mainly marked by difficulties with movement, though also associated with difficulties with language, perception and thought. Somebody with dyspraxia may have poor balance, co-ordination and handwriting, trouble remembering and following instructions, and under-developed social skills.
Up to ten per cent of the population show symptoms of dyspraxia, with around two per cent being severely affected. Men are four times more likely to be affected than women. Little is known about what causes dyspraxia. The possibility of it running in families has been put forward, though not confirmed. Other theories propose irregularities in, or impairment of, neurone and cell development. However, research continues.
Dyspraxia is managed with therapeutic input from a wide range of professionals, most commonly speech and occupational therapists.

Early Years Action / Early Years Action Plus
If a child is not progressing as they should be at nursery or pre-school, they may need extra support to help them succeed to the best of their ability. This is called Early Years Action. School Action is the equivalent programme for children of school age.
An Early Years Action plan will carefully address a child’s special educational needs, and probably include an Individual Education Plan (IEP) . The child’s progress will be regularly monitored and fed back to their carers. A child who makes little or no progress may graduate to Early Years Action Plus, which includes support from outside specialists.

Eczema
Eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin, which can occur anywhere on the body. It is marked by itchy, dry and red skin, and ranges from mild irritation to severe scaling. The most common types in children are atopic eczema, which affects around twenty per cent of children and is often associated with asthma and hay fever, and infantile seborrhoeic eczema (or ‘cradle cap’), which affects babies under one year old, and usually spreads from the scalp or nappy area. Unless the inflammation is very severe, treatment usually consists of emollients (moisturisers) and medicated creams. Many children will find that the condition lessens with age, or disappears altogether, especially if an allergic cause is found and avoided.

Educational psychologist
An educational psychologist provides support to children having difficulties within an educational setting. These difficulties often centre around learning, but may also involve behavioural issues or disorders. It is usually educational psychologists who make recommendations in relation to special educational needs. They also develop policy and advise teachers, governors, social workers and others on issues such as bullying.
Educational psychologists must be qualified teachers with significant experience, as well as academic training in psychology. Most are employed by their local authority, but some are independent. Every school should, in theory, have a named educational psychologist.
A child is referred to an educational psychologist by their school. If somebody else feels that this referral may be necessary, they will need to approach the school to discuss their concerns.
Educational psychologists work with each child differently. This may include observing them in the classroom and playground, having discussion with carers, teachers or the child one-on-one, and carrying out psychological or educational tests.

Epilepsy
Epilepsy is common, and can develop at any age. It is characterised by recurrent seizures, which occur when there is abnormal electrical activity in the brain. ‘Generalised’ seizures involve both sides of the brain and consciousness is lost; ‘partial’ seizures involve a specific part of the brain and consciousness is not lost, or impaired only slightly. About two thirds of childhood seizures are partial seizures. Epilepsy may result from a disability, an accident or illness involving brain trauma, a genetic predisposition, or it may have no known cause. It is managed or treated with anti-convulsant medication. About a third of children ‘grow out’ of their epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. Many will still need medication on a long-term basis.
You can find more about epilepsy from Contact a Family (you can look up five terms a month before you will be required to pay for this service).

Emergency foster care
Emergency foster care is fostering at very short notice, such as in the middle of the night if a child’s birth parent is taken into hospital. It is usually a temporary placement until another is found.
< Back
Enhanced fostering allowance
All foster carers receive an allowance for caring for their foster child or children to reimburse them for the costs of maintaining a child. Some receive an enhanced allowance on top of this, usually because they have extra skills, experience and training that make them able to care for children with special needs. This can include children with serious health conditions or disabilities, children with challenging behaviour, or children who have frequent contact with their birth family, eg several times a week.

Failure to thrive (FTT)
Failure to thrive is fairly common and is sometimes called faltering growth. It refers to children who are not growing or gaining weight at the expected rate for their age and sex. It is usually noticed in the first few years of life.
A failure to thrive is diagnosed by looking at factors including the child's height, head circumference, weight, and weight gain against a chart of what should be expected. If a baby was premature or has birth parents who are smaller than normal, this is taken into account.
There are a number of possible causes of failing to thrive, such as problems with feeding and/or nutrition, illness or a specific health condition. It can also be linked to problems during pregnancy, including illness and a birth mother's use of drugs or alcohol, and problems at home, specifically lack of care (or neglect) both practically and emotionally. For this reason, many adopted and permanently fostered children may be identified as failing to thrive when they first come into the care system.
There may be an increased chance that a child who failed to thrive goes on to experience some level of developmental delay.
< Back
Febrile convulsion/seizure
Two to 5 per cent of babies and young children will have a seizure during a fever. The seizure is ‘febrile’ as it is directly caused by the fever, usually triggered by an infection or inflammation.
This type of convulsion does not usually indicate epilepsy , which produces seizures without fever or illness. Studies also show that, with no other factors, such as family history, only 1 to 2 per cent of children who have febrile convulsions will go on to develop epilepsy.
A child who has had a febrile convulsion should always see a doctor for a check-up and to report the seizure. The convulsions seldom cause lasting effects like learning difficulties or brain damage, but this is slightly more likely if the duration of the seizure was abnormally long, or there were several seizures in a row. In these circumstances, an ambulance should be called immediately.

Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD)
Foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is used to describe a wide range of disorders affecting children whose birth mother misused alcohol during pregnancy. They are also known as foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or foetal alcohol effects (FAE). It is not clear what level of alcohol use – including volume, frequency and duration – can trigger structural damage to the brain in unborn babies.
Characteristics of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) often include abnormalities of growth, a weakened immune system, and certain facial characteristics. Children with some, but not all, of these characteristics are said to have foetal alcohol effects (FAE). Most babies with FASD will seem irritable, have trouble eating and sleeping, and be sensitive to sensory stimulation. They may also have some level of developmental delay and learning difficulties at a later stage. FASD cannot be cured, but with consistency, support and loving care, children can be helped to understand and live with their condition.

Freeing order
Under a freeing order, all parental responsibility is transferred from the birth parents to the local authority and the child is ‘freed’ for adoption. Freeing orders were often granted when the birth parents are considered to be unreasonably withholding their consent to their child being adopted. They were replaced by placement orders (England and Wales) in December 2005, and by permanence orders with authority for adoption (Scotland) as part of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007. However, there are still some children under freeing orders who are waiting for a new family.

Gastrostomy
A gastrostomy is a tube inserted into the stomach through a hole in the abdomen. It is either a permanent or temporary way of feeding children, who cannot eat or are not getting enough nutrients, with a special liquid. For example, a child may have a health condition or disability that causes digestive problems or makes it difficult for them to chew or swallow. A gastrostomy may be needed for a long or short length of time. Unless there are other health conditions or disabilities, most children with a gastrostomy are able to lead a normal, active life, and can take baths and showers and go swimming. A nurse will advise on how the gastrostomy works and how to look after it, and many families find it surprisingly easy to manage with practice. Usually children with a gastrostomy will need regular monitoring at either their GP surgery or hospital.
There are different types of gastrostomy devices. A standard gastrostomy is about 30cm long. Sometimes it is necessary to use a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, which reaches the stomach through the mouth, and is often used when there is doubt that a child will tolerate their feeds. Once they are able to do so, the PEG tube may be replaced with a smaller gastrostomy tube, around 5cm long, known as a ‘button’. The main brand of these is a MIC-KEY button. Only a small part of the button shows outside the stomach, and is covered by a valve. Some children may have a malecot tube, a flexible rubber catheter, inserted through the abdomen. There is no right or wrong device, and the decision depends on factors such as the child’s age and condition. Families can also change the type of gastrostomy at any point, if it no longer suits them or the child.

Glue ear
Glue ear, also known as otitis media, is a very common childhood condition that can cause temporary hearing impairment. Children under five are mainly affected, with around 90 per cent having glue ear at least once. If the hearing loss continues for a prolonged period of time, it can delay the speech and language development of the child.
Glue ear is caused when fluid builds up in the middle ear and causes inflammation, often after colds or flu. This can lead to dulled hearing and, sometimes, ear pain.
Glue ear usually gets better by itself with no need for treatment.  However, if hearing loss lasts longer than three months, it is usually treated with a minor operation to drain the fluid from the middle ear and insert grommets (tiny plastic tubes) to stop the build up of further fluid. Some may also need their adenoids (small lumps at the back of the throat that are part of the immune system) removed.
You can find more about glue ear from NHS Direct (free service).
< Back
Grommets
Grommets are used to treat glue ear (fluid build-up that causes hearing problems) in children. They are small, plastic drainage tubes inserted into the eardrum during a short operation. First the fluid in the ear is drained out, and then the grommets are inserted. Grommets usually fall out naturally after six to nine months. If the child still has glue ear after this time, they may need to have another set of grommets fitted.
Hay fever
Hay fever is a very common condition, caused by an allergy to pollen, and is usually genetic.
The symptoms include a runny nose, itchy throat, watery eyes and sneezing, which occur at a particular time of year, depending on the type of pollen the child is allergic to (e.g. Spring, trees; May to July, grass and flowers; winter, weeds or mould spores).
A child with hay fever cannot avoid pollen altogether, but their carer can try to lessen their exposure to it. Some examples include: keeping the child indoors when the ‘pollen count’ (number of pollen grains in the air) is high; keeping windows closed; drying clothes inside; and bathing the child after they have been outdoors.
If a child is really suffering with hay fever, there is also a wide range of effective antihistamine and steroid tablets, sprays and drops, all available over the counter. Many are now non-sedating, and should be safe for children in low doses, but this does depend on the child’s age, and should be checked with a doctor or pharmacist.
The good news is that people become less sensitive to pollen as they get older: many find their allergy ‘peaks’ in their twenties.
You can find more about hay fever from NHS Direct (free service).

Hearing impairment
People who have a hearing impairment lack hearing, either wholly or partially, and this is either present from birth or a result of disease, disorder or injury, later in life. The term covers all levels and types of deafness, including temporary deafness, such as glue ear .
Having impaired hearing is common. Around 20,000 babies and children, up to 15 years of age, have moderate to severe levels of hearing impairment, and approximately 12,000 of these children (and around 840 babies) are born with hearing loss every year.
Treatment depends on the type and severity of hearing impairment. Some children will be fitted with a hearing aid, a device that amplifies sound. Children with hearing impairments will also receive wide and varied support.

Heart murmur
In a healthy heart, blood pumps smoothly through the chambers and the valves open and close, making a series of recognisable sounds, audible to a doctor through a stethoscope. A heart murmur is an unusual heart sound, heard though the stethoscope, and sometimes described as a ‘whooshing’ noise. Heart murmurs are very common in babies and children.
Most heart murmurs are ‘innocent’ (harmless) and often result from the fast rate that children’s hearts naturally beat, or an increase in the speed at which the heart pumps – when excited or feverish, for example. Innocent murmurs do not need treatment and these children can lead an active, normal life.
A heart murmur that is not ‘innocent’ can be a sign of a heart condition, and may be accompanied by symptoms such as a blue tinge to the child’s skin, shortness of breath and dizziness. The child’s paediatric cardiologist will do a variety of tests to determine the cause of the murmur, which could include abnormal development of the heart tissues or a hole in the heart. Treatment depends on the cause and may involve cardiac surgery. A child with a severe heart defect usually has a good chance of leading a normal life.

Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a virus that is transmitted through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids. Infected mothers can transmit the virus to their baby during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
Symptoms of the virus usually develop within one to six months. It is estimated that one-third of infections produce no symptoms, another third have mild symptoms similar to those of flu, and a final third experience severe illness, which can include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and jaundice.
Many people will clear the hepatitis B virus and become immune, but those who retain the infection for longer than six months are said to have developed a chronic reaction. This is more common in babies and children.
If a baby is diagnosed as having the hepatitis B virus they will be immunised and given a course of immunoglobulin injections. Their progress will also need continual monitoring and regular check-ups. However, the majority of people with hepatitis B will not need medical treatment.

Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C is a virus that is transmitted primarily through contact with infected blood. Infected mothers can transmit the virus to their baby during pregnancy and possibly childbirth.
Hepatitis C predominately affects the liver. Around 20 per cent of people fight the infection and clear it naturally from their bodies within two to six months. For the rest, some will remain well and never develop liver damage or have any long-term effects. Others may develop mild to moderate liver damage (with or without symptoms). Around 20 per cent will progress to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) over many years. Symptoms can include chronic fatigue, aches and pains, and nausea.
There is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C, but treatment can clear the infection in around 50 per cent of people who have contracted it.

Hole in the heart / septal defect
A 'hole in the heart' refers to a defect in the wall between the heart's chambers. This occurs in the womb and is therefore present from birth. Sometimes a hole in the heart is genetic, but there is usually no obvious cause.
The three main ‘types’ are: an atrial septal defect (ASD); ventricular septal defect (VSD); and atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD).
An ASD means that there is a hole between the atria (the two upper filling chambers). An AVSD is less common, and refers to a hole in the middle of the heart, between the atria and ventricles. AVSD mostly affects people with Down’s syndrome . Both types can cause more blood to flow to the lungs, with the potential to damage them. A VSD is the most common type, where there is a hole between the ventricles (the two lower pumping chambers). This can enlarge the heart and make it work harder than it should.
A hole in the heart is usually found in the first few months of life, during a routine check-up, but sometimes it is not noticed until much later, perhaps even adulthood. This may be through chance or because possible symptoms have been spotted, such as appearing inappropriately tired, or out of breath after exercise, or simply because the child is ‘failing to thrive’ . Other indicators may be a heart murmur or frequent chest infections.
Often, a hole in the heart will produce no symptoms at all. This is especially true of an ASD or VSD. If so, and/or the hole is very small, it is best left alone, as a hole can never get any bigger. For many children, the hole will actually get smaller or even close by itself.
If the hole needs closing, this can be done through an operation or, if appropriate, a less invasive procedure, called a catheter intervention, where a tube is passed through a vein into the heart.
All children with a hole in their hearts will be at increased risk of infective endocarditis, an infection of the inner surface of the heart. They will therefore need antibiotics before operations or certain dental treatments. However, this risk disappears once the hole has been closed.
You can find out more about a hole in the heart from the British Heart Foundation .

Hydrocephalus
Hydrocephalus is a condition that occurs when there is too much fluid in the brain, because it does not drain away as it should. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid.
To treat hydrocephalus, many people benefit from having a thin tube, or ‘shunt’, inserted into the brain. This drains the fluid to another part of the body, as normally happens with people who do not have hydrocephalus. As the shunt is usually permanent, it is important to have regular medical appointments to monitor progress and prevent infection.
The cause of hydrocephalus is not known, but it is thought to be due to damage to the brain or the blood supply to the brain, an infection, or another condition such as spina bifida. It may be present at birth (congenital) or may develop later. Babies with hydrocephalus may have an enlarged head and symptoms such as vomiting, poor feeding and irritability. Children with hydrocephalus may have developmental delay and behavioural and learning difficulties.

Inappropriate behaviours
This applies to a wide range of behaviours that are seen to present difficulties, and may be socially unacceptable. Such behaviour is often intimidatory or invasive, such as outbursts of aggression, both verbal and physical, or sexualised behaviour. It may mean a person is simply behaving unsuitably in certain social situations; for example, it is appropriate that a child is friendly among friends and family, but such behaviour becomes inappropriate when a child is indiscriminately friendly to strangers.

Independent fostering agency
Local authorities and voluntary organisations, such as Action for Children (formerly NCH) and Barnardos, have provided foster care for decades.

Individual Education Plan (IEP)
Some children may need, or may receive as part of their school’s policy, an Individual Education Plan (IEP). This legal document sets out the strategies used to meet the identified needs of an individual child who may have learning difficulties or disabilities, or perhaps be excelling academically. Plans are set, with expected outcomes, and everything is written down so that the child is constantly monitored. The IEP may include the Special Educational Need (SEN) Code of Practice.

Interim care order
An interim (or temporary) care order may be granted while waiting for a final care order court hearing. This will give the local authority and others involved more time to gather information about the child’s welfare to help the court make its decision.

Lazy eye (amblyopia)]
Lazy eye, or amblyopia, is an early childhood condition that affects around one in 25 children. It is a problem with the development of vision by the child's brain, and usually occurs in one eye, but can occur in both.
If the visual image from one eye is very different to the other (for example, as a result of a squint , cataract, astigmatism , etc), the brain starts to ignore this image and instead uses the image from the good eye. The eye that is ignored is called a ‘lazy eye’.
Vision develops from birth until around eight years. It is therefore very important that treatment for lazy eye takes place in this age bracket. If left untreated, the vision will be permanently damaged.
The usual treatment is to wear a patch over the good eye for several hours a day for a number of months. The patch obscures vision in the good eye, encouraging the weaker eye to work harder. Other treatment includes eye drops, vision therapy and wearing special glasses or contact lenses.
You can find more about lazy eye from NHS Direct (free service).

Learning difficulties / disabilities
People with a significant impairment in their ability to learn are described as having learning difficulties/disabilities. ‘Difficulties’ and ‘disabilities’ are often interchangeable terms but ‘disabilities’ sometimes implies a lifelong condition, and/or a symptom of a diagnosed disorder. Learning difficulties/disabilities are often described as ‘mild’, ‘moderate’ or ’severe’.

Life threatening / life-limiting condition
A condition is life threatening when there is treatment that may cure it, but also the risk that the treatment could fail, such as with cancer. Children in long-term remission or following successful curative treatment are not included in this category.
A condition is life limiting when there is no reasonable hope of a cure. This may involve progressive deterioration, e.g. muscular dystrophy, or the inevitability of premature death, e.g. cystic fibrosis . Although a life-limiting condition cannot be cured, there may be plenty of treatment and support that can ease its severity and hopefully prolong the person’s life expectancy.

'Looked after'
A looked after child is ‘in the care of’ or ‘accommodated by’ their local authority, often within a foster family, because their birth parents are temporarily unable to care for them. Most children return to their birth families within a short time but other alternative options, such as adoption or permanent fostering, may be considered to be in their best interests.

Makaton
Makaton is a trademarked communication system based on a combination of speech, sign language and graphic symbols. It is used internationally, in slightly adapted forms.
Makaton is primarily used by children and adults who, for various reasons, such as being on the autistic spectrum or having learning disabilities, have difficulties with speech or reading. Those using Makaton will speak using visual signs, or read by looking at pictorial signs. The eventual aim is for the signs to no longer be a necessary prop.
Makaton is a system that the child will have to learn and build upon, with input from their carer. In the UK, there is a national network of qualified Makaton tutors who provide training workshops for carers. Others may prefer to purchase distance training packs. If Makaton has been recommended for a child by a professional, such as a speech therapist, they may share their own training resources with the carer.

Malnutrition
A balanced diet includes a combination of food groups, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, dairy products, vitamins and minerals. Anyone can become malnourished if, over a prolonged period of time, they lack all or some of these food groups.
Children under five are particularly vulnerable, especially if premature or they had a low birth weight. Certain medical conditions could also affect a child’s ability to feed by mouth or absorb nutrients. Looked after children may be at particular risk due to early neglect , which is likely to have included a poor diet.
There are different types of malnutrition, depending on the nutrients that are lacking, and these produce slightly different side effects. However, most malnourished children will appear more lethargic, anxious or irritable than ‘normal’. They will also take longer to recover from illness or infection. If malnutrition is severe and untreated, it can eventually lead to death.
A person of any weight can be malnourished if they do not eat enough of the ‘right’ foods, but most children with the condition will be underweight and small. They may fail to grow to their full genetic potential, both developmentally and physically ( failure to thrive ). This is especially true of children who experience malnutrition in the first two years of life, when the effects are often long-lasting.
By the time you adopt or permanently foster a child, any malnutrition should have been medically treated. However, if you suspect a child in your care is malnourished, it is important to work with healthcare professionals to supplement nutritional intake; for example, by introducing special formula milk or fortified food, by mouth or into the blood or stomach (with a nasogastric tube ).
As well as continuing to encourage your child to maintain a healthy diet, and showing them how, you may also need to support them in approaching food more positively, especially if they show signs of hoarding, overeating or being very picky.

Mental ill-health
One in four people in the UK experience mental ill-health at some point in their lives. Different people are affected in different ways and often there is no clear or specific cause.
There are many different types of mental health issues including schizophrenia, depression, and eating disorders. Some types have a genetic element, which means they tend to run in families, while for others, there is no clear cause.
Various types of treatment are available for mental health problems. Some people benefit from regular medication, a course of counselling, or other types of therapy.

Microcephaly
Children have microcephaly when the circumference of their head is smaller than is age appropriate, either because the brain has not developed properly, or it has stopped growing. It is more usual for the brain to be normally formed, despite its smaller size.
Microcephaly is often evident at birth, and its cause can either be genetic or non-genetic. Where it is genetic, it is often a symptom of conditions such as Down’s syndrome. Non-genetic reasons include maternal misuse of drugs or alcohol during pregnancy.
Children with microcephaly have various neurological impairments, from mild learning difficulties to cerebral palsy, but not all will have developmental delay. It really does depend on the child and any accompanying conditions they may have.
A child with microcephaly will always have a smaller head than is age appropriate. Their development will be monitored throughout childhood, and additional support, therapeutic or medicated, will be offered, as needed.
You can find more about microcephaly from Contact a Family (you can look up five terms a month before you will be required to pay for this service).
It is really important that you find out how this medical condition specifically impacts on this particular child, as it may vary widely. We are recommending that agencies ask their medical adviser to provide information on this, which will be included in the child's profile when available.

Mother and baby care
Sometimes a birth mother under the age of 18 will move into a carer’s home with their baby, so that the carer can provide support and teach them how to care for their child. This is called a ‘mother and baby’ placement.

Motor skills
Learning motor skills is part of the complicated process of child development. Motor skills are what you use when you move the muscles in your body. Gross motor skills use large parts of the body to produce movements such as crawling, walking, and throwing. Fine motor skills are more refined, and use smaller parts of the body to produce movements such as grasping a toy, holding a pencil, or sticking out your tongue. Children with motor skills difficulties may benefit from support such as physiotherapy.

Nasogastric tube
A nasogastric (NG) tube enters through the nostrils, down the back of the throat, and into the stomach, to enable a child to be fed instead of, or as well as, feeding via the mouth. It is normally a temporary way of feeding children who cannot eat or who are not getting enough nutrients with a special liquid. For example, a child may have a health condition or disability that causes digestive problems or makes it difficult for them to chew or swallow, or they may have a blockage at the back of their throat or oesophagus (food tube).
There are two main types of specially designed nasogastric tubes: a short-term tube, made of PVC plastic, that needs to be changed every five to seven days, and a long-term tube, made from very soft plastic, which can be used for four to six weeks. The tube stays in place until it needs replacing, is no longer required, or an alternative method of feeding, such as a gastrostomy , is used instead.
Inserting the tube is a safe, though not very pleasant, procedure, and can be completed very quickly. Adhesive tape is used to secure the end of the tube to the child’s nose. Some carers may be given the option to learn how to do this themselves (with training), though for other children, the procedure will always be done by a nurse. Usually, children with a nasogastric tube will need regular monitoring at either their GP surgery or hospital.
A nasogastric tube can also be used to remove the contents of the stomach, including air, if needed.

Neonatal unit
A neonatal unit is a unit of a hospital specialising in the care of neonates. A neonate is a newborn baby in the first 28 days of life. Babies who are either premature or full-term with neonatal problems can be looked after here.
Within a neonatal unit there can be separate specialised units:
• Special care baby unit/ special baby unit:
A special care baby unit is a unit specialising in the care and monitoring of ill or premature babies. The unit can help with feeding and keeping the baby warm. If a baby is born with drug withdrawal symptoms , they can be monitored and treated there.
• Neonatal intensive care unit:
A neonatal intensive care unit, often shortened to NICU, provides higher intensity care for sicker babies, and has a higher nurse to baby ratio. Very premature babies are often cared for here, or babies who need help with breathing, or who need an operation.

Neurofibromatosis
Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder causing tumours, usually benign (posing no danger to a person’s health), on nerve tissue. Although genetic, neurofibromatosis can occur spontaneously in a family, and from there on be inherited. It is already present in a person at birth, though typically diagnosed later in childhood.
Some people with neurofibromatosis are almost entirely unaffected by it, while others are disabled by the disorder. The disorder has two types – NF1 and NF2 – and symptoms between the two can vary slightly. For example, people with NF2 generally develop tumours on the nerves in both ears, causing hearing loss, possible deafness, and problems with balance.
Indications that a person has neurofibromatosis include 'café au lait' spots, nodules, lumps, and unusual freckling on the skin. More occasional features are short stature and large head size.
Other complications, although uncommon, can occur. These include abnormalities of the skeleton, cancerous growths and seizures.
There is currently no cure for neurofibromatosis. The disorder is instead treated by surgically removing tumours. Additional therapeutic support, such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, can also be helpful, depending on the individual's symptoms.
You can find more about neurofibromatosis from Contact a Family (you can look up five terms a month before you will be required to pay for this service).

Nurture group
A nurture group is a small supportive class, usually within a mainstream primary school, that provides a safe, secure and predictable environment. It aims to respond to the different developmental needs of each pupil, as well as provide support with academic work.
Children who attend nurture groups are often from stressful or disrupted backgrounds, and need to catch up socially and emotionally before they can progress in formal education. The groups usually have an emphasis on communication and language development through interaction, social learning, co-operation and play. The children are also encouraged to trust in adults by fostering a good relationship with the teacher who runs the group.
Children remain a member of their mainstream class while attending nurture group sessions every week for around two to four terms. They eventually return full-time to their regular class.
You can find out more from the Nurture Group Network .

Occupational therapy
Occupational therapy assesses and treats people with physical, psychological or learning disabilities that affect their quality of life. The aim of the therapy is to help them achieve more independence.
Occupational therapists work with people of all ages, and also offer support to the carers of children with special needs. A child’s main ‘occupation’ is to learn and play, and occupational therapy may be recommended for children who have difficulties with their cognitive, physical and motor skills, such as those with developmental delays, spina bifida or cerebral palsy.
Occupational therapists work in various community settings, but will usually visit patients at home. Assessment can then include suggesting how they might adapt to their surroundings, e.g. by installing wheelchair ramps in the home, as well as helping them learn new ways of doing things.
