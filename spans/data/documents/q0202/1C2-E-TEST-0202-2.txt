The UK did not meet the monetary conditions to join the Euro in the early 90s (remember John Major and mini recession).  Also, from working in UK banks in the late 90s I got the impression they didn't want to take a risk, and adopted a wait and see attitude,  I would have meant a loosening of control by the Bank of England.
So since then its more of a media campaign against it, seen as unpatriotic etc, rather than an educated debate, which is unfortunate.  To say a country looses its identity because of the money in its pocket is ludicrous, I have yet to wake up and think I was living in a different country - and when in Greece, Spain, Belgium etc, I still manage to remember where I am.  As I'm sure a British person would too.
As for a failing currency - just go to any country outside Europe and see what currency the offer you transactions in?  Even when I was in the States I was asked if I wanted my credit card charged in Euro or USD, I chose USD because it would be cheaper.  But the USD will recover, it has to.
