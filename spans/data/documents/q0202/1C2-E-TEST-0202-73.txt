Sir,
I wrote the                letter below to the Telegraph today - but I doubt if it will be                printed. I'm forwarding it to you just out of curiosity if you have                a thought or two on the thesis presented therein. It is much the                same as a theme presented centuries ago by Blaise Pascal, in that                [paraphrasing] out of a striving for good, people often commit the                greatest evils.
Best Regards,

Subject: Monetary Union
Dear Sir,
It does not take a crystal ball to foretell the eventual outcome                of the drive to monetary union. The scenario is all too familiar                to those who might regard history as lessons for the future.
The scripting                  appears clear: following the monetary union of Europe, including                  all eastern European countries up to the Russian border, the North                  American trading block initiates similar convergence on the US                  Dollar [apologies to the Canadians, but their government has had                  fairly weak monetary controls for some time], uniting the US,                  Mexico, and Canada. Following this, the South and Central American                  countries begin to converge their weaker currencies in order to                  stave off loan repayment pressures and build sufficient economic                  strength to make it too expensive for the US banks to threaten                  them much further. Much of this is driven by local protectionist                  measures designed to appease internal political blocks - but by                  definition these issues create severe economic conflicts with                  political blocks in other trading groups. The question arises                  as to whether the core trading blocks seek partners in other parts                  of the world - or won't those other areas be driven to creating                  their own trading associations?
With these                  three large and protectionist trading groups, the question is                  whether the ancient enemies Japan, China, and the [then] merged                  Koreas can pass beyond their centuries long antipathies to form                  the Asian trading block. Should that appear successful, then where                  will Russia fall? It would be easier for the newly westward facing                  Russian governments to throw in their lot with Europe. This will                  be sought by the Europeans for Russia's store of natural resources                  if nothing else.
And then                  what of the Middle East? India? The Muslim countries? Africa?                  In short order, reading the forces of economic isolationism, they                  will also band together in some more or less stable associations                  if only to protect what they see as their economic survival, though                  not necessarily in the same group. India might well develop an                  association with all the Pacific and Southeast Asian countries                  that are wary of the Chinese and Japanese. The predominantly Muslim                  countries will band together to combat "the Great Satan".                  Africa will take the longest to converge because the competing                  tribal interests will continue to plague even the overwhelming                  economic survival issues. Israel? Well, as strange as it might                  sound, it is still a Semitic country and Jews and Muslims lived                  peaceably together for centuries until the Europeans got involved                  in that part of the world. The Europeans are now [in this scenario]                  more concerned with protecting their interests than a potential                  problem country in the middle of hostile Arabic nations.
So, in driving                  economic forces into larger blocks for the protectionist and political                  interests of the "leaders", we could well create a six                  or seven division world... whose protectionist and self-interested                  policies make conflict almost inevitable. Thus by converging economic                  policies which were designed to forestall local conflicts do we                  make the probability of global conflict more possible, and probably                  inevitable.
However,                  this is all simple forecasting - but the trends are obvious. Never                  forget Newton: for every action, there is an equal and opposite                  reaction. And sometimes in political realities, the "equal" is a matter of local interpretation.

Many thanks!
You are                somewhat pessimistic perhaps. People often insist that their governments                pursue enlightened policies that could generate growth...
But then                again not always by any means! Vested interests can enjoy an extraordinary                lease of life; just look at the big three of the euro-zone,
yours sincerely,

Dr. Minford,
Yes, it is                a bit pessimistic and if the scenario plays out, it will take decades                to develop, I suspect. However, it was just such economic hegemony                [and Bismarckian mismanagement] which is enabled by the development                of self-interested currency zones that helped set the stage for                the rise of German nationalism after WW I. I don't recall that anyone                has ever lost a wager betting on the side of vested self-interests                of politicians when the alternative is an advantage for the "greater                global good", if you'll excuse that term.
I'm not really the pessimist, but more a cynic. In my youth there were times when                one world-ism was a relatively attractive concept. And, should there                be some monetarist enlightenment among global leaders along with                free trade provisions, I still have a strong feeling that it would                provide for a remarkable economic renaissance among the LDC's. However,                as long as politicians are greedy, self-serving, power-hungary,                and controllist bureaucrats it is unlikely to happen. Given that                I see no realistic chance of changing the spots of the political                leopard, the result is more likely to be combative than constructive.
That is awfully                negative - even I rail at the pessimism inherent in that last paragraph,                but the further down the road we go with the current UK government                in a supposedly enlightened country, the further they reveal themselves                in just that light. What hope, then, do people in LDC's have when                the level of corruption in their governments is even more apparent                and burdensome? It is not a pretty sight, forecasting the political                future based on the behaviour of politicians.
And if you                wonder from where this gross level of cynicism arises, take one                of last week's news stories where a farmer was arrested for pulling                the plug on a "rave" held by trespassers in one of his                barns. The police would not evict the trespassers, as they also                refused to do in a prior week when the same thing happened. Since                we can no longer control and protect our own property, and woe unto                the man that defends his house from burglars seeking to steal those                things for which he has worked, what liberty and protections of                liberty remain for us, the peasants of this land?
Best Regards,
Douglas Schulek-Miller
Thanks. There                are indeed plenty of things to be pessimistic about. When it comes                to the sort of global protectionism you are talking about however                the forces of trade are pretty strong today fortunately. People                have discovered after the disastrous protectionism pursued by most                ldcs in the 1950s and 1960s that it doesn't work compared with 'openness'.                It is the latter that gave the emerging countries their massive                growth. Hence today China wants to be in WTO more than anything                and now is, and will do whatever it takes to stay in...
yours sincerely,
