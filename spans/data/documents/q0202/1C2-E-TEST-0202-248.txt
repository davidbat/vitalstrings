Hey people,
I'm being a bit lazy here, as there might be a thread about this elsewhere on here. But I can't be bothered to look.
I was wondering if anyone might have an answer to my subject question? Why is it, that the UK PSN has only a small library of PSOne Classics? Most of which are absolute balls.
Don't Sony think that we won't be willing to pay for games a second time?
I love being able to play FF7, FF8, and Metal Gear Solid on my PS3 and PSP. I'd love even more to be able to play Resident Evil 2 and other games that I spent hideous amounts of time playing in my youth.
I know it's possible to create a US account, and find some strange 'PAYPAL' like account to pay for these games..
But why should I have to do all that? Why should I have to switch accounts on my PS3 to play these different region games? I know it's not that much effort, but why should I have to skip around restrictions just to play content that has been available on the US and HK PSN for ages?
Soooooo, um.. yeah..
Why not make the games available?
Cheers

I gave up on PS1 "classics" on PSN yonks ago. (My god did you see the "classics" they put up last week???)
A C/F PSP and Ebay will give far more real PS1 classics. Plus you get those lovely old little game boxes to!
Sony and publishers are just not that bothered with PS1 over here from what I can see.

I did see them.. What is the point? I wonder if ANYONE would buy them.
If they are going to update the catalog, why not put the more popular and more highly priced games up? Surely they get more money from them.
I do have a PSOne collection in an attic somewhere in west Wales...
But it's pretty far away, and I'm not even sure if it would work anymore as it's a chipped console and might have either burnt out, or will soon.
I do have a lot of US versions of games, which are good.. But again, too far away, and I do like having the games to play on my PSP.
So, Im either lazy, or have more money than sense... But i am willing to pay for these games again.

Because Sony Europe are a bunch of lazy incompetant C***S.
Just look at the PSN store, I mean how hard would it be to add a tab labelled "Demos" to the menu like the US store?
How long have we been waiting for a euro release of GOW collection or Demons Souls?
Nothing to see here!

The Classics I understand, it is due to licensing issues and rights.  (Not an excuse, Sony can easily resolve these but they do not appear to want to.)  However the lack of a Demo section is absolutely incomprehensible to me.
