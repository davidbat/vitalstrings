 
GIZA  THE             ADOPTION THEORY
It                   must be emphasised that the age of the Giza monuments is a complex                   question, and not a subject on which anyone can speak with absolute                   certainty. Anyone who pretends to have a definite answer to this                   question, based on the evidence available as at 2003, is, in                   my opinion, deluding himself. Rather, it is a case of looking                   at all the evidence, making judgements about ‘facts’ which                   seem to contradict one another, and drawing an overall ‘most                   likely’ conclusion based               on the balance of evidence.
GIZA  THE                   ADOPTION THEORY
In                 my book ‘The Phoenix Solution’ (1998), I noted that                 virtually all of the supposed evidence for 4th dynasty construction                 of the Giza Pyramids and Sphinx was, in fact, consistent with                 an adoption scenario. In other words, it seemed entirely plausible                 that the Egyptian kings Khufu and Khafre had adopted pre-existing                 structures in the form of the Great Pyramid, the Second Pyramid                 and the Sphinx, and merely added the causeways which ran between                 the mortuary and valley temples. It should be noted that the                 construction of each of these causeways was an absolutely stupendous                 task in its own right, and would more than justify the 4th dynasty                 workers’ villages which have recently been found at Giza.                 (As for the Third Pyramid, the much smaller pyramid of Menkaure,                 I did not include this in my adoption hypothesis).
Only                 one piece of evidence speaks unambiguously for 4th dynasty provenance                 of the Giza monuments, namely the ‘workmen’s graffiti’ inside                 the Great Pyramid which contain the names of king Khufu. This                 graffiti, discovered by the English explorer Colonel Howard Vyse                 in 1837, was located inside sealed chambers (the so-called ‘relieving                 chambers’ above the King’s Chamber) and thus, on                 the face of it, seemed to prove that the Great Pyramid was built                 by the 4th dynasty king Khufu.
If                 this were so, it would be virtually certain that all of                 the structures at Giza, including the Sphinx, had a 4th dynasty                 provenance (as I note in ‘The Phoenix Solution’,                 all of the Giza structures are closely linked stylistically,                 topographically and geometrically; one reliable dating of any                 single monument has the potential to date all of                 the structures, as Egyptologists are fond of pointing out).
However,                 against the evidence of the workmen’s graffiti, I discovered                 quite a lot of evidence – including some peculiar anomalies                 which had previously gone unrecognised – which argued for                 a much older construction of the Great Pyramid, the Second Pyramid,                 the Sphinx, and their associated megalithic temples. This evidence,                 which I will summarise in a moment, clearly produces a tension                 with the evidence of the workmen’s graffiti.
How                 to resolve the apparent conflict between the workmen’s                 graffiti in the Great Pyramid, which incorporate the names of                 the 4th dynasty king Khufu, and all the other evidence which                 seems to point to an earlier, pre-4th dynasty provenance?
The                 solution, I argued, was that the workmen’s graffiti in                 the ‘relieving chambers’ of the Great Pyramid had                 been faked by their ‘discover’ Colonel Howard Vyse,                 who had copied inscriptions which he had already found outside the                 Great Pyramid in the temples and the quarries (the presence of                 these inscriptions being fully consistent with the 4th dynasty ‘adoption’ scenario                 mentioned earlier). His motive, I suggested, was a desire for                 fame and money. For the full details of my argument, which differs                 in certain crucial respects from other writers’ forgery                 theories, see chapter three of ‘The Phoenix Solution’.
Now,                 it must be emphasised that I do not claim with any degree of                 certainty that the workmen’s graffiti was forged by Howard                 Vyse. It is purely a theory, as indeed are most assertions within                 the field of Egyptology. In the absence of a radiocarbon dating                 of the ‘red ochre’ paint which was used, and without                 access to Howard Vyse’s original diaries, proof of the                 forgery theory lies beyond our grasp. In the meantime, we can                 only speculate about the authenticity of the workmen’s                 graffiti, based on what we know about them and, more importantly,                 on what we know about the context in which they are found. And                 it is this context, in my opinion, which points to a pre-4th                 dynasty provenance of the Great Pyramid and most of the other                 structures on the Giza plateau.
Consider                 the following evidence which I cite in my book.
1                   The Sphinx
From a detailed study of the highly-weathered limestone rock of the                 Sphinx and the enclosure in which it sits, Robert Schoch, a geologist                 from Boston University, has concluded that the monument was exposed                 to prolonged heavy rainfall, and he has therefore dated its construction                 to around 7000–5000 BC. I will not regurgitate the whole                 argument here, but in my opinion Egyptologists have not satisfactorily                 rebutted Schoch’s premise. Moreover, as noted earlier,                 a redating of the Sphinx threatens to redate most of the other                 structures on the Giza plateau.
In                 addition, it should be noted that the Inventory Stele (26th dynasty)                 informs us that Khufu repaired the headdress of the Sphinx after                 it had been damaged by lightning. If this is true (and there                 is no particular reason to doubt it), this would negate the theory                 that Khufu’s son Khafre built the Sphinx, and it would                 throw up serious questions about the orthodox dating of the rest                 of the Giza site. Moreover, the Inventory Stele fails to make                 any claim that Khufu built the Sphinx or the Great Pyramid, and                 these surprising omissions offer considerable support to my adoption                 hypothesis.
In                 my view, the evidence from geology and the Inventory Stele, together,                 make a compelling case for an older Sphinx.
2                   Radiocarbon Dating
Egyptologists                 date the 4th dynasty kings Khufu and Khafre to the period 2500-2400                 BC. However, the 1983-84 ‘Pyramids Carbon-dating Project’,                 commissioned and funded by the Edgar Cayce Foundation, and directed                 by the Egyptologists Mark Lehner and Robert Wenke, discovered                 some highly anomalous results.
For                 example, thirteen samples of mortar from the Great Pyramid produced                 dates in the range 3101-2853 BC, and an average date of 2977                 BC. Similarly, seven samples of mortar from the Second Pyramid                 produced an average date of 2988 BC. Equally intriguing, a sample                 of wood from ‘Khufu’s Boat’, buried alongside                 the Great Pyramid, produced a remarkable date of 3400 BC.
Such                 was the confusion caused by the 1983-84 ‘Pyramids Carbon-dating                 Project’ that a second, more thorough study was carried                 out in 1995. The results of this study were published (belatedly)                 in 2001 in the journal ‘Radiocarbon’, volume 43,                 number 3, pp. 1297-1320. I will comment upon this report in due                 course when I have had time to consider its contents. In the                 meantime, copies can be purchased here .
3                   Inscriptions
The                 Inventory Stele, mentioned earlier, was supposedly written by                 the priests of the cult of Khufu during the 26th dynasty to praise                 the deeds of the ancient king. However, it makes no claim whatsoever                 that Khufu built the Great Pyramid. A very strange omission indeed                 if Khufu really did build the Pyramid.
Moreover,                 4th dynasty inscriptions found at Giza confirm that Khufu was                 building the mastaba fields for his high officials to the west                 of the Great Pyramid in ‘year 5’ of his reign. Is                 it really likely that Khufu, having initiated the largest, most                 complex and innovative pyramid-building project in Egyptian history,                 would have allowed any work to be carried out in building mastabas?                 Can we seriously believe that Khufu would have put his great                 venture at risk by diverting resources to the building of such                 mastabas in the fifth year of his reign, bearing in mind that                 he did not know whether he would live long enough to see the                 completion of his pyramid? The idea is ludicrous. The inscriptions                 only make sense if the Great Pyramid was already built before                 the time of Khufu. (As far as I know, I am the first person to                 have highlighted this anomaly; my thanks to Mark Lehner for mentioning                 it in his book ‘The Complete Pyramids’.)
4                   The Alignment between Giza and Dahshur
In                 chapter two of ‘The Phoenix Solution’, I pointed                 out a relationship between the Giza and Dahshur pyramids that                 no-one had ever noticed before. In a nutshell, it involves an                 alignment between the twin pyramids built by Sneferu at Dahshur                 and the two giant pyramids at Giza. Amazingly, the alignment                 is such that Sneferu’s pyramids must have                 been oriented towards two pre-existing pyramids                 at Giza (this fact is apparent to any intelligent person who                 knows the topographical constraints of the Giza and Dahshur sites                 and who is able to study the alignment free from bias and preconceptions;                 interested parties are referred to figure 4 in the book).
Since Sneferu was the father of Khufu, this fact alone precludes any possibility   that Khufu built the Great Pyramid at Giza.
5                   Archaeological Context
As                 I argue at great length in ‘The Phoenix Solution’,                 the Great Pyramid does not fit in to the standard evolutionary                 model of pyramid-building. In particular, its builders used an                 innovative design and several revolutionary technologies which                 immediately thereafter disappeared from the archaeological record.                 When studied in its essential archaeological context, the Great                 Pyramid simply does not belong in the mooted sequence of 4th                 dynasty pyramids
6                   Refurbishment of Khafre’s Valley Temple at Giza
As                 has been pointed out by Robert Schoch and others, there is clear                 evidence that the granite casing blocks of Khafre’s Valley                 Temple were fitted to limestone blocks which were already severely                 weathered. Since the granite blocks are dated to the 4th dynasty,                 the inner limestone core, i.e. the original temple, must date                 to long before the 4th dynasty.
If                 the Valley Temple dates to long before the 4th dynasty, then                 it becomes a virtual certainty that the other megalithic temples                 at Giza, which are attributed to Khufu and Khafre, were also                 built long before the 4th dynasty (it may be significant that                 some of the limestone blocks were excavated from the Sphinx enclosure,                 making the temples contemporary with the carving of the Sphinx).                 Of course, no-one would build temples in front of non-existent                 pyramids. QED, the two giant pyramids, by the same token, must                 date to long before the 4th dynasty.
Summary
All                 things considered, I suggest that there were two phases to the                 pre-dynastic construction at Giza: firstly the Great Pyramid;                 and secondly the Second Pyramid, Sphinx, and megalithic temples.                 (This sequencing reflecting the superior build quality of the                 Great Pyramid.) These construction phases would probably date                 to the 6th-4th millennia BC.
Thereafter,                 it is possible that a major renovation of the Great Pyramid and                 Second Pyramid was undertaken by the 1st pharaonic dynasty, this                 accounting for the radiocarbon dates of c. 3000 BC.
Later,                 in the 4th dynasty, the two giant Pyramids at Giza were adopted                 by Khufu and Khafre, who added the huge causeways which ran between                 the mortuary and valley temples. Perhaps at this time the third,                 smaller pyramid of Giza was built by Menkaure to create a symbolic                 link to the three belt stars of Orion.
It                 is a corollary of my theory that the workmen’s graffiti                 inside the Great Pyramid cannot be what they seem, i.e. they                 cannot constitute proof that the 4th dynasty king Khufu built                 the Pyramid. A possible explanation for the workmen’s graffiti                 is that it was forged by Colonel Howard Vyse in 1837 (he certainly                 had the motive, opportunity and means to commit such an act).                 Another possibility, however, which might yet become the stronger                 contender, dependent on future discoveries, is that the divine                 names in the graffiti refer to pre-dynastic gods and an earlier,                 pre-dynastic king Khufu.
Postscript
It                 was not my aim in ‘The Phoenix Solution’ (1998) to                 offer conclusive proof of the provenance of the workmen’s                 graffiti. My main focus in that book was to research the meaning                 of the Egyptian religion; and that, by and large, has been my                 focus ever since. At the present time (2003), I am not actively engaged in debate over the age of the Great Pyramid, and I find                 the dogmatism and passion of my opponents rather nauseating.                 I do not share their enthusiasm for this subject; I have no axe                 to grind about the age of the Great Pyramid, and I have better                 things to do with my time than argue the toss about evidence                 which, for the most part, can be interpreted one way or another,                 depending on one’s preconceptions. Nevertheless, I do have                 a passing interest in seeing new evidence brought to light pertaining                 to the Great Pyramid’s age, and thus in respect of the                 workmen’s graffiti I urge open-minded Egyptologists to                 pursue two pertinent lines of enquiry:
1                   Find Howard Vyse’s Original Diaries
While                 I was writing ‘The Phoenix Solution’ in 1998, the                 British researcher Martin Stower informed me that the original                 journals of Howard Vyse’s 1835/37 expedition to Egypt could                 not be located. These journals, if they could be found, would                 shed light on the circumstances surrounding Howard Vyse’s ‘discoveries’ inside                 the Great Pyramid, including the all-important graffiti containing                 Khufu’s names. A little while later in 1998, Martin Stower,                 in a fit of pique, announced that the Howard Vyse journals had been                 found. Since then, however, nothing has been heard on this matter,                 and it would seem that Stower’s claim should be taken with                 a large pinch of salt. My challenge to Egyptologists is this.                 Find the Howard Vyse diaries and show them to me. If I cannot                 find at least three incriminating statements in those diaries,                 I will drop my argument that the workmen’s graffiti was                 forged.
2.                   Radiocarbon Date the Paint of the Khufu Inscription
In ‘The                 Phoenix Solution’, I noted that the red ochre paint which                 was used in ancient Egypt contained an organic binder, which                 would allow painted inscriptions to be radiocarbon dated. In                 chapter 14 of my book I wrote: ‘in the event that the painted                 marks ‘discovered’ by Howard Vyse above the King’s                 Chamber are ever radiocarbon dated, I confidently predict that                 their age will be nearer to the time of Howard Vyse than to the                 time of Khufu.’ My challenge to Egyptologists is this.                 Take a sample of red ochre paint scratchings from the various                 inscriptions in the Great Pyramid’s relieving chambers                 and from other 4th dynasty sites in Egypt and radiocarbon date                 those paint samples. If the paint used in Khufu’s names                 is contemporary with that used in other 4th dynasty sites, you                 win. If the paint is younger than that used in other 4th dynasty                 sites, I win. If, on the other hand, the paint is significantly                 older than that used in other 4th dynasty sites, then we jointly                 investigate the idea that the inscriptions commemorate an earlier                 king Khufu.
Dating               the Pyramids by Stellar Alignments
A number of studies have attempted to shed light on the Great Pyramids   date of construction by examining possible alignments to stars. Whilst I do   keep an open mind about such methods, I find myself entirely sceptical about   two such studies which have been published in recent years: firstly, Robert   Bauvals theory that the Great Pyramids shafts were aligned on certain   stars, e.g. Sirius and Al Nitak in Orion; and secondly, Kate Spences   theory that the Egyptians used the circumpolar stars Kochab and Mizar for the   alignment of all their pyramids to true north. Both of these theories,   it should be noted, support the orthodox theory that the Great Pyramid was   built by Khufu c. 2450 BC.
On Robert Bauvals Star-Shaft Datings
The Great Pyramid contains four tiny shafts, which lead upwards and outwards,   northwards and southwards respectively, from the Great Pyramids so-called   Kings and Queens Chambers. For many years it was assumed that these   shafts were for ventilation purposes, but there have always been Egyptologists   who have argued for a ritual or symbolic function. Two such scholars were Alexander   Badawy and Virginia Trimble, who put forward a theory in the 1960s that the   shafts were aligned to certain stars, with one of them being targeted towards   Orions Belt.
In 1993, Robert Bauval took Badawy and Trimbles theory a step further,   using new data for the shafts slopes, as measured by Rudolf Gantenbrinks   robot. His findings were as follows:
