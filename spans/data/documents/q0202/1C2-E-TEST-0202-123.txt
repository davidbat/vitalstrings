General questions
Q. Why was 1 January 2002 a significant date for UK          individuals and businesses?
A. On 1 January 2002, euro cash was introduced in the          twelve euro-area countries. By 28 February 2002, at the latest, their          respective national currencies were withdrawn from circulation and have          ceased to be legal tender.
Businesses in the UK that have links with the 12 euro-area countries,          must now expect to find all financial transactions being carried out in          euro.
Q. Can a UK Tax Return be completed in euros?
A. No. All the taxes that HMRC administers are sterling          taxes. Judges have ruled that these taxes can only be assessed and charged          in sterling. Therefore, all tax returns must be completed in sterling.          If you receive taxable income in euro, or any other foreign currency,          it must be converted into sterling. There are no plans for this to change.
For example:
1. If you receive income in euro in the form of monthly interest on your          personal euro bank account, then this should be translated at the spot          rate for the last day of each month. If you receive annual interest, then          this should be translated at the spot rate on the day the interest is          received.
2. If you invoice a business customer for 200 euro, then use the spot          rate for that day to convert to sterling for your accounts, and when you          receive payment of 200 euro, then use the spot rate for that day to convert.          Any difference in the two sterling amounts is an exchange rate loss or          gain that should be reflected in your accounts. Alternatively, providing          the exchange rate has not fluctuated too much, then the monthly average          figure can be used for each transaction instead of the daily spot rate.
You can find out what the exchange rate was for any particular day (ie          the daily spot rate) from the Bank          of England website
Accounts questions
Q. Can a UK business draw up its accounts in euro?
A. A company's accounts should accurately reflect the          state of its business and the transactions it has undertaken. In particular,          a company is legally obliged to prepare accounts that give a true and          fair view. It will depend on the nature of the enterprise and the extent          to which it carries on business in euro, and has assets and liabilities          denominated in euro, whether euro accounts will present such a true and          fair view. You should talk to your accountant before taking any steps          to keep financial records in a non-sterling currency, or to change the          currency in which you prepare your accounts.
You do not have to get clearance from HMRC to draw up accounts in euro,          but you may need to compute the company's taxable profits in sterling.
Q. Can a UK business draw up its tax computation and          other supporting calculations in euro?
A. Yes. A UK business can normally prepare and submit          most of its tax computation in euro, but it would have to convert the          final figures into sterling to complete its tax return.
However, the detailed answer depends on the accounting period that you          are referring to, because the Finance Act 2000 simplified the way that          Company Tax is computed by companies who keep their accounts in euro (or          in any other foreign currency):
For periods beginning after 31 December 1999
Any company that draws up their accounts in euro can compute their profits          in euro and translate the result into sterling.
For periods beginning on or before 31 December 1999
If your company had made a 'local currency election', and drew up its          accounts in euro, you could compute your company's profits in euro and          translate the result into sterling.
If your company had not made a 'local currency election', you would have          had to take your euro accounts and work out what exchange gains and losses          would have arisen had the accounts been in sterling, then include any          taxable gains and losses in your company's tax computation.
The exception is the capital gains tax computation that must be calculated          in sterling, as dictated by current legislation.
Q. What exchange rate should I use to convert euro          accounts and computations into sterling to complete the tax return?
A. If your company's accounts are completed in euro,          you can compute the company's corporation tax (CT) profit in euro and          translate the result into sterling for the self-assessment form.
The rules about which exchange rate you should use to do this have been          simplified by Finance Act 2002.
For company accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2002:
You should use the euro/sterling exchange rate that would be used if          the company's accounts were translated into sterling in accordance with          generally accepted accounting principles. This might be the exchange rate          for the last day of the company's accounting period, or an average exchange          rate for the period. Your company's accountants or auditors should be          able to advise which is the more appropriate in your company's particular          case. Whichever you choose, you should use a consistent approach in successive          accounting periods.
For accounting periods beginning before 1 October 2002:
You should use the euro/sterling exchange rate for the last day of the          accounting period. You can use an average exchange rate, but only if the          company makes a written election to its tax inspector to do so. The election          has to be made during the accounting period for which it is to apply.
Q. Can I use average exchange rates if my company's          financial year does not coincide with the end of the tax year?
A. No. The HMRC website (see ' Rates          and tables ') gives average exchange rates between various foreign          currencies and sterling, including between euro and sterling, for years          ending 31 March and 31 December. Arithmetically, you will not get the          right answer if you try to apportion the average rates for two successive          calendar or tax years.
The average rates which you can find on the HMRC website are an average          of the daily exchange rates published daily in the Financial Times (the          London closing rate for each day). However, you are not obliged to use          these rates. Your company's accountant or bankers should be able to tell          you the average exchange rate for the company's accounting period.
Q. What exchange rate should I use to convert my euro          income and expenses into sterling to include in my sterling accounts?
A. The exchange rate to use to convert euro expenses or income into sterling          is really an accounting matter, and not an issue on which HMRC can advise.          A UK company must follow generally accepted accounting practices when          drawing up its accounts. However, as a general rule, items of income should          be translated at the rate prevailing when the income arose, and items          of expense should be translated at the rate prevailing when the expense          was incurred. Further details can be found in SSAP20 (Statement of Standard          Accounting Practice), which deals with foreign currency translations.
For example:
1) If you receive monthly interest on your euro bank account, then this        should be translated at the spot rate for the last day of each month, or        if you have annual interest, then this should be translated at the spot        rate on the day the interest is received.
2) If you invoice a customer for 200 euro, then use the spot rate for that        day to convert to sterling for your accounts, and when you receive payment        of 200 euro, then use the spot rate for that day to convert. Any difference        in the two sterling amounts is an exchange rate loss or gain that should        be reflected in your accounts. Alternatively, providing the exchange rate        has not fluctuated too much, then the monthly average figure can be used        for each transaction instead of the daily spot rate.
The Bank of England issues daily exchange rate figures, which can be          found on the Bank of England          website
The average exchange rate for year ended 31 March or 31 December can be          found on the HMRC website under ' Rates and          tables ' [Select the option 'Exchange Rates' and enter the country          as 'European Union'].
3) Any exchange gains or losses on monetary assets (such as bank deposits          in euro) or liabilities (such as loans in euro) must be accounted for.          To do this the value of the assets and liabilities must be translated          into sterling at the year-end exchange rate, and compared to the values          at the previous year-end. Any increase in value is an exchange profit,          and must be reflected in profit in its accounts, even though it has not          yet been realised.
In this respect, euro is no different to any other foreign currency.          Therefore if you are used to dealing, say in American dollars, then apply          the same rules but use the euro-sterling exchange rate rather than the          dollar-sterling exchange rate.
Q. Can I use the same exchange rate to calculate my          company's profit in sterling, and to calculate the tax payable in euro?
A. No. The exchange rate at payment is NOT linked to          the exchange rate you must use for your tax calculations. The exchange          rate used for tax calculations is a historical rate, but the exchange          rate used for a payment is the one in force at the time of that payment.          Once your tax liability has been calculated in sterling, it will remain          the same whether you chose to pay in sterling or in euro.
Q. Does HMRC have a daily exchange rate telephone helpline          for VAT?
A. Yes. HMRC does have a telephone helpline (01702 366349),          which could be used as one source of information to help you make an estimate          of the exchange rate on the day of payment. Other sources include:
