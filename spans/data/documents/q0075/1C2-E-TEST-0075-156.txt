Blue Star Media's Tony Bleill wrote a nice STORY on the Wisconsin Lakers-White National Team during their march to the championship of the USJN Mid-America Challenge in Champaign, Illinois.
The Lakers are in the national spotlight with victories over several top teams this season including Gym Rats, Mac Irvin Fire - Godfather, North Tartan Nike Elite, Illinois Elite, and CSS Bison Judd's.  In addition, every 2012 graduate on the Lakers-White 2011 team was placed either NCAA D1 or D2; the first time the Lakers placed an entire class of players in such fashion.
