Mike Brown spent three years as an assistant for San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich, watching and learning the game from the longtime Spurs coach. Nine years later, he still considers Popovich a mentor and will seek out his advice.
So it wasn’t a huge surprise to Brown that Popovich won his second Red Auerbach Trophy as the 2011-12 NBA Coach of the Year award Tuesday. Popovich, who previously won the honor in 2002-03, totaled 467 points, including 77 first-place votes, from a panel of 119 sportswriters and broadcasters. If it was up to Brown, Popovich would win the award every season.
“In my opinion, he should have a gazillion of them with what he’s done with that team,” Brown said. “… I couldn’t be happier for him.”
Brown said working for Popovich was “like going to school because you learn so much.” He credits Popovich with much of his success as a head coach in Cleveland and with the Lakers. But he didn’t just learn Xs and Os.
“Pop’s people skills are off the charts,” Brown said. “Whether it’s the people in the front office or the players 1-15, he’s great. You can try to copy it the best you can, but you can’t because he is the best at it.”
