Report: Mike Brown New Head Coach of LA Lakers 4 years 18 Million?

This is being reported by Matt Steinmetz of CSN.
According to the report Brown is no longer in the running for the Warriors job and is expected to sign a deal to become the next head coach of the LA Lakers.
Here are the details :
Brown, the former coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, is expected to be  named the new coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, according to two league  sources.
Brown was considered a frontrunner for the Warriors’ job, but  is expected to sign a four-year contract worth approximately $18 million  with the Lakers.
I broke down in detail why I thought Brown would be a good fit for the Lakers ( read why Mike Brown is the best coach for Lakers ).  If this report is accurate, we will see if I know what I am talking about or not.
We know Brown will bring a more intense defensive scheme to the Lakers (something they need), the question will be what will the offense look like?  What is the future of the triangle offense?
Also how will Kobe Bryant react to the hire when it was clear he wanted Brian Shaw to be the next head coach?
All interesting questions that will be answered in due time, if this report is true.
