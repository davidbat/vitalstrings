*We will have a chat at 4 p.m. Bring your questions!
-- ESPN Los Angeles' Andy and Brian Kamenetzky  talk to former Lakers assistant coach Brian Shaw, who shared that he found out through the media that the Lakers had hired Mike Brown as head coach, and that he was never given any direct feedback on how he could improve as a coach.
-- Ball Don't Lie's Eric Freeman isn't surprised Bryant's popularity has dropped. 
-- Silver Screen and Roll's Dexter Fishmore muses that LeBron James won't be able to light up the Lakers on Christmas Day this year.  
-- Lake Show Life's Chris Shellcroft criticizes Jim Buss' communication skills.
Tweet of the Day: "Told that due to soccer match fixing allegations, Besiktas' bank accounts are frozen, preventing Deron Williams' team from signing players." -- DraftExpress  (NBA Draft Express' Jonathan Givony
Rick Friedman Reader Comment of the Day: "The Lakers certainly have all the chips in place needed to run for another Championship. What makes it interesting though, is how the pieces will work together, will they have the chemistry needed when it is needed? Will they be cohesive as a unit in the later goings of the season?It is imperative that Coach Brown mobilize this team and its attributes as meticulously as possible to ensure the pieces fitting together and complementing executions."
"The Lakers have everything to gain by utilizing [their] veterans as fittingly as they can. Again Coach Brown has to be cognizant as to who runs the point and in what stage of the game he'll use people.The only unknown factor in the equation so far that's an unknown is egos. If guys can be made to be accountable as Coach has preached times before, then the Lakers [have] another winning season on their hands." -- Andrew Bliss Cain
