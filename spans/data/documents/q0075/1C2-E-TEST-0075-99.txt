Yes, that Mike Brown . The former head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers is seemingly next in line to coach the Los Angeles Lakers . Check out the report  HERE . 
Brown was the head coach of the Cavaliers from 2005-2010 and was fired following the loss to the Boston Celtics in the 2nd round of the 2010 playoffs. During his tenure with Cleveland, the defensive minded coach had a relatively impressive list of accomplishments. His Cavaliers teams reached the 2007 Finals and posted back-to-back 60+ win seasons in '09 and '10. He compiled an overall regular season record of 272-138 (.663) which ranks 5th all-time in win percentage. Brown was also honored with the 2009 NBA Coach of the Year Award. Only a year later, he was relieved of his duties and worked this past season as an analyst for ESPN. Fast forward one more year and Mike Brown is the replacement for the legendary Phil Jackson .
This is a surprising move for the Lakers organization as many assumed Brian Shaw would be simply be promoted from assistant to head coach. Cavs fans have had the most experience with Brown as a head coach so what say you?  Does this make you root for the Lakers more or less? Personally, I'd like to see Brown do well, so I am tempted to casually root for him. Is this a good choice for the Lakers? I honestly do not know. It is an interesting selection, but the Lakers must have really liked something about him to go away from Shaw. This doesn't directly impact the Cavaliers, but it is certainly interesting nonetheless.
