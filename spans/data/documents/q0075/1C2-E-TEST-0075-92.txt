When talking about his center Pau Gasol's style of play, Lakers head coach Phil Jackson couldn't help but attack Kevin Garnett.
The Los Angeles Times reports that while discussing his desire for Gasol to play more aggressively, he said that he accepts Gasol for who he is -- and he's grateful that Gasol doesn't play like Garnett .
"He is who he is," Jackson said. "We're not going to make him into Garnett. He's not going to go around punching guys [below the belt]."
Jackson's comments were referencing when Garnett hit Channing Frye below the belt during a game in which the Celtics lost 88-71 to the Phoenix Suns.
Jackson isn't the only coach critical of the C's power forward. According to Sportingnews.com, Suns head coach Alvin Gentry also had some choice words for KG.
"I used to be a big fan of [Garnett]," Gentry said on his radio show on KTAR-AM. "Some of the antics he's pulled lately, you don't need to do that as a star player. I've never seen Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant or even a Dwyane Wade do that. ... If you're asking me, yeah, I lost a little respect for him. I love his competitive nature but there is no place for what he was doing in our game."
