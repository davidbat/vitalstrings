Ramon Sessions has decided not to exercise his player option with the Lakers, instead becoming an unrestricted free agent.
Sessions had to make a decision by June 20, so this comes right on cue. Sessions leaves approximately $4.5 million on the table to hit the free agent market, and it will be interesting to see what type of deal he is in search of at this point in his career. Sessions was exposed in the postseason, but he averaged 12.7 points and 6.2 assists on 47.9 percent shooting in 23 games with the Lakers. Just 26 years old, Sessions will likely be looking for a multi-year deal. Jun 19 - 12:04 PM

Ramon Sessions, who has to decide on his player option for next season by June 20, will weigh his options prior to the deadline.
Sessions can opt out of his current deal or exercise the $4.55 million player option to return to the Lakers next season. "It's one of those things where I'm just going to sit down and look at everything," he said. Sessions has said multiple times previously that he hopes to remain with the Lakers. May 29 - 9:30 AM

Ramon Sessions, who owns a player-option for next season, said he not yet thought over all of his options, but he "definitely" hopes to stay with the Lakers.
Sessions is set to make just over $4.5 million if he opts-in next season.   Even though Sessions has said it was "100% clear that the team wanted him back" from his exit meeting on Tuesday, the Lakers loss to the Thunder exposed their need for a better point guard and it should be interesting to see if the team makes a move for a better floor general before Sessions makes his decision, which he has said will be around June 20.

The Lakers want Ramon Sessions to be more aggressive, as he has only taken 10 shots over the first two games of the Lakers-Thunder series, making two of them.
While it may sound as simple as taking more shots, Sessions knows he needs to feed the Laker big men - Andrew Bynum and Pau Gasol - not to mention keeping Kobe Bryant happy with the amount of shots he is accustomed to.  Sessions has a very delicate balancing act ahead of him as he looks to help get the Lakers into the win column in Friday night's Game 3. May 18 - 2:51 PM
