“This is a very  exciting day for the Phoenix Mercury and our fans,” said Phoenix Mercury  General Manager Seth Sulka. “Paul’s extensive experience in the professional  game, as well as being an excellent communicator and accomplished teacher, will  be a huge benefit to the Mercury organization as we strive to bring a championship  to the city.”
The 5th head coach in Mercury history, Westhead comes  to the Mercury after serving as an assistant coach for the NBA’s Orlando  Magic for two seasons (2003-2005). He served as head coach of the Lakers from  1979-82. Early in the 1979-80 season, Westhead was elevated from assistant to  head coach, and with a team led by center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and rookie guard  Earvin “Magic” Johnson, guided the Lakers to a 4-2 series win over Philadelphia  in the 1980 NBA Finals. He has the third highest winning percentage among all-time  Lakers coaches (112-50, .691).
“It is a tremendous opportunity for  me to coach in the WNBA and be a part of the Phoenix organization,” said  Westhead. “I am confident that I can help move the Mercury forward and get  into the mix of the playoffs and beyond. I love the game of basketball and have  dedicated the majority of my life to it. I want to share what I know about the  game with the players here and together help make the Mercury successful.”
Known for his teams that produced fast-breaking, high-scoring offenses, Westhead  has also been the head coach for the following NBA teams: Chicago (1982-83) and  Denver (1990-92), compiling a 184-224 (.451) record. He has also been the head  coach in the ABA (2000-01) and in the Japanese Pro League (2001-03).
Westhead is in high demand as a clinician as well. He is sought after all over  the world for his fast-breaking, high-scoring offensive techniques. He has spent  time helping with USA Basketball programs and was a guest clinician for the 2005  USA women’s youth development festival teams this summer in Colorado Springs,  CO.
Westhead also had tremendous success on the NCAA level. He has guided  collegiate programs at LaSalle, Loyola Marymount and George Mason, compiling a  record of 285-223 (.561) in 18 seasons. His most memorable stint was 1985-90,  when he led Loyola Marymount to a 105-48 record in five seasons, including three  consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and a berth in the Elite Eight in 1990.  Since 1980, Westhead is one of two coaches to have appeared in the NCAA Tournament  and won an NBA Championship, the other being New York Knicks Head Coach Larry  Brown.
During the past two summers (2004-05), Westhead assisted the NBA  in one of their key initiatives, Basketball without Borders program in Treviso,  Italy. This program serves as a basketball instructional camp in Europe for young  people designed to promote friendship, healthy living and education through sport.
A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Westhead graduated from St. Joseph’s  (PA) in 1961. He and his wife, Cassie, have four children: Monica, Patrice, Paul  Jr. and Julie.
