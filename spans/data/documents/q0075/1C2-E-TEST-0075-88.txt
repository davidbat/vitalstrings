The Los Angeles Lakers have made it clear that Mike Brown is not their new head coach quite yet, but that hasn't stopped those in the media to speculate on his potential coaching staff in Los Angeles.
Among those currently being mentioned by  Yahoo! Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski  and  Fox Sports' Sam Amico   include current Lakers assistant Chuck Person (currently up for a couple of head coaching jobs himself), the excellent Tim Grgurich (spent this season in the Dallas Mavericks organization), Mike Malone and John Kuester . 
Kuester (currently on the hot seat as the Detroit Pistons head coach) and Malone(who spent this season with the New Orleans Hornets ) were Brown's assistant coaches with the Cleveland Cavaliers .
Those names are all highly respected in the basketball industry, and would be great to have on Brown's staff, but there's one small problem being bantered about: Money. Wojnarowski says Brown still doesn't have budget for hiring assistants and,  with the Lakers cutting costs , it remains a question who's affordable for staff.
