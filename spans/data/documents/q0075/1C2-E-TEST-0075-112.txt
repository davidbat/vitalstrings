According to Jerry Zgoda of the Star Tribune, former Utah Jazz head coach Jerry Sloan may not be done coaching.
Said Zgoda:
Sloan would listen if another team approached him, according to a source who has spoken to Sloan recently, and would seriously consider the right situation. But he won’t actively seek another job or have anyone campaign for him. Almost alone among NBA coaches, Sloan, who turned 69 a week ago, doesn’t have an agent.
So who would come calling? A lot of teams, I’m sure. Sloan is an all-time great. The Kings, Bucks, and Pistons will all probably be looking for new head coaches, but perhaps the most intriguing head coaching vacancy next season will be that of the Los Angeles Lakers.
That’s where Sloan comes in. Would he come out of retirement to coach the Lakers? I can’t see why not. Kobe Bryant says Phil Jackson is serious about retiring at the end of the season, so who better to replace a Hall-of-Famer than another Hall-of-Famer?
More, Sloan has never won an NBA Championship, and the Lakers will most certainly contend for a championship next season. How many coaches would say no to coaching the Lakers? Not many. And I doubt Sloan would either.
Which coach would be the best fit for the Lakers next season?
Jerry Sloan
