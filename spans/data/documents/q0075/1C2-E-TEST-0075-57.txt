Just before tipoff against the Denver Nuggets on Friday night at the Staples Center, Lakers head coach Mike Brown left the building for personal reasons to presumably deal with a family matter. Brown’s absence became the number one topic during the game even though the Los Angeles Lakers were able to clinch a playoff spot with a win over the Denver Nuggets, 103-97.
According to Mike Bresnahan of the L.A. Times , this won’t be an extended absence for Mike Brown:
Brown went through his regular pregame briefing with reporters about 90 minutes before tipoff but headed home soon after that. He is expected to return for the Lakers' game Sunday against Dallas, according to a team official.

Along with Brown missing this game for personal reasons, the Lakers also had to deal with the absence of Kobe Bryant for the fourth consecutive game . Fortunately, the Lakers have played brilliantly as of late despite the absence of Kobe and Brown recently. Players like Andrew Bynum, Metta World Peace and Matt Barnes have stepped up their game considerably over the past few games and as a result the Lakers are now playoff bound once again.
Now that the Lakers have officially punched their ticket to the playoffs, the Lakers’ coaching staff will most likely attempt to rest their starters over the last six regular season games. Kobe’s playing status over these final six games is still up in the air, but he will almost certainly miss Sunday’s game against the Dallas Mavericks .
