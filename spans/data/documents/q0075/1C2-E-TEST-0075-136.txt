He also leads the NBA in playoff victories with 229 and playoff winning percentage (.688).
It is hard to believe, but he was named Coach of the Year just once, in the 1995-96 season when his Bulls set an NBA record with 72 wins..
As part of the "NBA at 50" celebration during the '96-97 season, Phil Jackson was selected one of the Top Ten Coaches in NBA History. While it was a list without ranking, one could easily asume that he is the best ever, despite what Auerbach's defenders could say.
In 2008 he was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach.
