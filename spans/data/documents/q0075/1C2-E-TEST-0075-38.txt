CHARLOTTE --              The Charlotte Bobcats have narrowed their coaching search to three candidates: Former Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, Indiana Pacers assistant Brian Shaw and Los Angeles Lakers assistant Quin Snyder, an NBA source confirmed Monday night.
ESPN.com first reported those three as the Bobcats’ finalists from an original list of 10 candidates.
The Bobcats are expected to hold a second round of interviews soon for Shaw and Snyder, so each can speak with team owner Michael Jordan. Jordan was present in Salt Lake City for the initial interview with Sloan.
The Bobcats are hiring a replacement for Paul Silas, after the team announced his contract would not be renewed following 1 1/2 seasons as coach.
Sloan, 70, is a Hall of Fame coach who twice got the Jazz to the NBA Finals.
He coached 19 Jazz teams to the playoffs. His regular-season record (he also coached the Bulls three seasons from 1979 to 1982) is 1,221-803.
1/2 seasons after resigning from the Jazz. He’s made a point of saying he’s not leery of taking over a Bobcats team that went 7-59 last season.
Neither Shaw nor Snyder has been a head coach in the NBA. However, Snyder coached Missouri previously and was a head coach in the NBA Development League.
Shaw also might be a candidate for the coaching opening with the Orlando Magic once that franchise hires a general manager. He has deep ties to the organization.
Snyder, a former Duke point guard, is a bit of a wild card in this process. He’s a high-intellect guy known to be an innovator offensively. The Bobcats were among the NBA’s worst teams this season in offense in scoring average and field-goal percentage.
The Bobcats hope to have a coach hired in time for the June 28 draft. However, team management said it felt no time pressure to make a hire.
