ProBasketballTalk:
Phil Jackson isn't going to talk about it. Kobe Bryant won't go near it. The Lakers aren't going to talk about it or wear their Los Lakers jerseys. While there was a small protest outside, inside Staples Center the Arizona Immigration law discussion was dead.
Except for Kobe Bryant's wife. Vanessa Bryant is part Hispanic and she wore a shirt that said, "Do I look illegal?" to the game.
The reference was clear.
She -- and often the couple's daughters -- are regulars at Lakers games. They tend to stay out of the limelight, as much as that is possible for a high-profile family. But she gets noticed, and used that to make a statement at Game 1 against Arizona.
Keep coming out for the Los Suns series and protesting. The MSM sports establishment is trying to stay away from this as much as possible. We can't let them.
Thank you, Vanessa!
