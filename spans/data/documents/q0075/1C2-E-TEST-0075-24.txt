Mike Brown reaches deal to become next Lakers head coach

Mike Brown has agreed in principle to become the Lakers' next head coach, according to an NBA official who was not permitted to speak publicly on the matter.
Brown is expected to sign a contract later Wednesday or Thursday. The deal is worth between $4 million and $4.5 million per season, NBA officials said. Brown's contract is thought to be for three years, with a team option on the fourth season that would give him partial pay if he is not retained.
Phil Jackson retired as the Lakers' head coach after the team was eliminated by Dallas in the second round of the playoffs.
Brown, 41, was head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers for five seasons until he was fired in 2010. He had a 272-138 record.
He was named the NBA's coach of the year in 2009, leading the Cavaliers to a 66-16 record.
Brown also led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals in 2007, but Cleveland was swept by the San Antonio Spurs.
[Updated at 3:55 p.m.] The Lakers issued a statement: "we’ve met with Mike [Brown] and are very impressed with him.  In addition, we have an outline for an agreement in place and hope to sign a contract within the next few days.”
