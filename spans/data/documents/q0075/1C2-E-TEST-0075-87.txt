The Lakers’ shift away from the Phil Jackson era continued Wednesday with the hiring of new strength and conditioning coach Tim DiFrancesco to replace longtime Jackson aide Chip Schaefer.
DiFrancesco was the head trainer for the NBA Development League’s Bakersfield Jam. He has his doctorate in physical therapy from University of Massachusetts Lowell.
In an announcement posted by the Jam, DiFrancesco said: “The Lakers epitomize what it is to be a champion, what it is to be successful. They take the time to go above and beyond in every single level of their organization and for me to be a part of something like that is truly what I always wanted. It is truly a dream come true.”
DiFrancesco was quoted in a Sports Illustrated article last month about the new direction of nutrition management for sports trainers, as was Lakers head trainer Gary Vitti.
Schaefer was with Jackson for all 11 of his NBA championships, including the five with the Lakers. He was the director of athletic performance and player development last season and with the Lakers for 12 years.
The Lakers have also rehired assistant trainer Marco Nunez, who enters his fourth Lakers season, and massage therapist Marko Yrjovuori, who enters his eighth. The Lakers will still add one more to their training staff in a similar position to the one previously held by noted athletic performance coordinator Alex McKechnie, who joined the Toronto Raptors .
Carlos Maples previously was hired to replace Rudy Garciduenas as the Lakers’ equipment manager.
