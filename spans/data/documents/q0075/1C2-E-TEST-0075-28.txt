Spring Lake
Spring Lake varsity golf coach George Bitner was recently selected as a finalist for National Coach of the Year in golf.
Bitner was nominated for the honor by the Michigan Golf Coaches Association.
As a finalist, Bitner has the option to travel to the National High School Athletic Coaches Association banquet on July 25 in Fargo, N.D., where he will be presented with a plaque. After finalists for each sport are introduced, one will be chosen for National Coach of the Year.
Bitner, 75, is nearing the conclusion of his 43rd season coaching golf at Spring Lake. He led the Lakers to a Lakes Eight Conference title this spring and they’re also expected to fare well at today’s Division 2 district tournament.
Bitner led Spring Lake to a sixth-place finish at last season’s Division 2 state finals.
Bitner has also coached Spring Lake’s girls program since its inception in 1980. Spring Lake advanced to the state finals this past October for the first time since 2003.
