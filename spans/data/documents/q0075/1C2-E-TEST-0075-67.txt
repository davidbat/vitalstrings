Lakers Coach Warned
You're Too Damn Fast!
L.A. Lakers head coach Mike Brown had a run in with the California Highway Patrol yesterday ... after officers witnessed the guy BLAZING down an Orange County freeway in a brand new badass ride.
TMZ has learned ... Brown was pulled over on the 91 Freeway for pushing his new Audi near the 85 MPH mark ... in a 65 MPH zone.
Law enforcement sources tell us ... Brown was "very cool" with the officer ... and was let off with a stern warning.
Somewhere, Andrew Bynum is jealous ...
