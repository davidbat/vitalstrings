Pat Garrison - Coach (Retired)
After              a number of years coaching with the Lakers, Coach Pat has decided to              retire. He has given so much to baseball over his many years as a              coach. He has been a great part of our recent success and he will be              missed.
Coach     Pat joined the Lakers staff during the 2007 season, but has been     around baseball his entire life. He has coached in a variety of     leagues in Rockaway and elsewhere.
