The Minnesota Timberwolves will play the Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center tonight (Dec. 11), which means that Lakers Coach Phil Jackson’s longtime assistant Kurt Rambis, now Head Coach to the Timberwolves, will be returning to his former home. Rambis will receive his championship ring in a pre-game ceremony as well. Jackson and Rambis won three NBA championships while working as a team, most recently when the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic is the championship last June. When asked what he plans on doing when his old pal comes to Staples Center, Jackson joked, “You try to bust them really hard. Give them no quarter.”
The Lakers have won 10 consecutive games and at 17-3 have the best record in the league, while the Timberwolves have lost eight of 10 and are 3-19. “His team is starting to play well and starting to be competitive and they got over the hump, so to speak. So I’m warning these [Lakers] guys not to take them lightly,” said Jackson. As for any advice for Rambis, Jackson told the Los Angeles Times, “Well he’s learned everything. He doesn’t have to have any advice. He saw all the mistakes I made over the years, I’m sure. But you just be yourself. That’s all you have to do, is just be totally true to yourself in situations and follow your instincts.”
