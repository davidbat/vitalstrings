 History of the GMC Great Lakers Motorhome Club, Inc.
Written by William Helmore, a Charter member
 
The initial organizational meeting of the Club was held at Ted's Restaurant in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan during a snowstorm in mid-January, 1976. The meeting was the result of a great deal of work and effort by the GMC Truck and Coach Division of General Motors, The FAMILY Motor Coach Association (FMCA) and a group of approximately fifteen (15) very devoted GMC motorhome owner families and GMC executives.
This new club was chartered on January 24, 1976 as the "GMC Michigan Wolverines" with a scope of the states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.  As it worked out, this would be the first GMC Motorhome chapter chartered under the auspices of the FMCA. At the Club's first rally in May, 1976, the Club's name was changed to "The GMC Great Lakers" and its scope changed to incorporate all states and provinces of Canada that touch the Great Lakes. The name change was made to calm the Buckeye and Spartan fans who were not happy with the name "Wolverines". The scope was changed to cover a larger geographical area and to encompass a larger group of prospective members.
In 1979 the Club dropped its affiliation with FMCA in favor of the "GMC-MOA" (GMC Motorhome Owners Association), also the name was changed to "The GMC Great Lakers Motorhome Club".  The Club was re-chartered with the FMCA on March 10, 1981.  In 1988, FMCA was petitioned and the original 1976 date of charter was reinstated.  In 1990 the Board felt that the Club should incorporate and the membership agreed, so on December 7, 1990 the Club became "The GMC Great Lakers Motorhome Club, Inc.".
The Great Lakers were a chapter of the National GMC Motorhome Owners Association as well as the FMCA during the years of 1976-1980.  This organization was sponsored by the GMC Truck and Coach Division and held rallies in May, July and October.  The name of the owner's organization was changed on July 23, 1977, to the "
GMC Motorhome Owners Association, Inc." (GMC-MOA).  At its (The GMC-MOA) peak there were some two-dozen GMC clubs around the country.
Over the years since January, 1976 the Club has had the good fortune to find and elect a long list of talented officers, the first of which were: Virgil Barbe, President; Bob Beyer, Vice President; Ann Schipper, Secretary; L. L. "Mac" McKenzie, Treasurer; and Mac McDonnel, National Director.
Twelve men have served as President of the organization: Virgil Barbe, 1976-78, 1980-82, 1987; Edward Kurtz, 1979; Tom Tryon, 1983-85; Alex Birch, 1986; Dan Ryan, 1987, (filled out Virgil's term after he resigned); Ivan Johnson, 1988-90; Bill Howard, 1991-93: Don Bolles, 1994-96; Dick Olmsted, 1997-99; and George McLeod, 2000-2002; John Harvey 2003-2005; and Franklin Griffin 2006-2008, William Helmore 2009 to the present.
As stated in volume 1, edition 1 of the "GMC Motor home Traveler" newsletter, which was published by the GMC Truck and Coach Division, "The club was formed to promote friendship among GMC motorhome owners and to provide them with a direct link with the GMC Truck and Coach management executives and, because the GMC club members are also members of the FMCA, they will share in the benefits of that organization as well." By the Club's second rally the infant motorhome club had grown to 65 member coach families. At the end of each ensuing year, the Club's membership has ranged from approximately 70 to nearly 275 members and at the end of the 2006 camping season the membership stood at about 207 members, which includes honorary as well as regular memberships.
 
The Club holds rallies each month, May through October, on the second full weekend of that month (Friday must fall in that month for the weekend to be counted in the month). A birthday party has been held in January at a hotel with a dinner and varied activities.  As of the end of 2006 the Club has had 196 rallies, 27 GLASS rallies, 26 special rallies, 29 GMC International rallies, 8 FMCA conventions and 20 birthday parties for a total of 306 rallies.  Some of the special rallies have been joint rallies with other GMC Clubs. The rallies have been held at locations all over Michigan, some in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Wisconsin and eight in Canada.  Branson, Missouri was the farthest away summer rally.  Several winter rallies have been held in Florida and Arizona for those wintering in the southland.
The Great Lakers are one of the largest regional product orientated GMC Clubs in the FMCA.  The club presently includes members from California, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee,  Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Canada.
  
In the spring of 1976 the GMC organization in Pontiac, Michigan began to publish a newsletter for and about the GMC Motorhome Clubs and the motorhome itself.  The "GMC Motorhome Traveler" as it was called, contained articles on club doings, service tips, a monthly calendar of club activities and other articles of interest to GMC motorhome owners.  It was published from February, 1976 through February, 1979 by the GMC Truck and Coach Division of General Motors at no charge to the GMC Motorhome owners.
Over the years, eight families have been involved with the Great Lakers Newsletter.  They are: Sally Barbe, 1976-1978; Ray Gamble, 1979; the Staubs, 1980 & 1987; The Davises, 1981-1986; the Skalskis, 1988-1992; William Helmore, 1991-1996; Dottie Harman, 1996-1999; and John Wright, 2000 to the present.  The Great Lakers Newsletter has featured tech tips, birthdays, anniversaries, news about members, as well as news about the monthly rallies.
