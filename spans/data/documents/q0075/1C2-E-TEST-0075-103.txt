The Plain DealerFormer Cleveland Cavaliers coach Mike Brown is one of the candidates to replace Phil Jackson as head of the Los Angeles Lakers, according to ESPN.com.
The Los Angeles Lakers are looking at former Cleveland Cavaliers coach Mike Brown as a possible successor to retired coach Phil Jackson, according to ESPN.com .
The Los Angeles Lakers are taking a deliberate approach to their search for a successor to Phil Jackson, but NBA coaching sources told ESPN.com the team has added Mike Brown to its list of candidates.
The former Cleveland Cavaliers coach, now working as an analyst for ESPN, is expected to interview "soon" with the Lakers, sources say.
Brown would become the fourth known candidate for the job, along with former Houston Rockets coach Rick Adelman, ex-Los Angeles Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy and Lakers assistant coach Brian Shaw, who is regarded as the only serious in-house contender to replace Jackson.
The site says that Brown is considered a leading candidate for the head coaching vacancy at Golden State. Indiana Pacers President Larry Bird said he's among those being considered for that job, as well.
Brown was dumped by the Cavaliers shortly after the team built around LeBron James fell to the Boston Celtics in the 2010 playoffs. James left the Cavs last summer in a televised special called "The Decision" and "took his talents to South Beach." James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh decided that together, they could win multiple NBA titles with the Miami Heat.
As of now, the Heat and Chicago Bulls are tied 1-1- in their playoff series.
