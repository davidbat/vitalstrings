This won’t be too bad if they keep Brian Shaw.
Jer dawg Posted: May.25 at 4:41 pm
I’m not convinced Brown is right coach for this job. I am convinced though he will be calm and cool during his time here. Lakers wanted to be cheap as far as I’m concerned. Whatever he coaches the Lakers to it’s going to be an unfair deal. What i mean is, if he overachieves, he not getting what he’s worth. If he underachieves Lakers will look stupid and overspend again on quality.
Not saying Dunleavy was right, but I though a proven veteran coach would be better.
Jukai Posted: May.25 at 4:44 pm
I don’t know what’s funnier, the actual news or the two or so people who are actually claiming Brown is a halfway decent coach.
Brad Long Posted: May.25 at 4:46 pm
WTF?
Brad Long Posted: May.25 at 4:48 pm
No seriously, WTF?
feez22 Posted: May.25 at 4:57 pm
the 2 teams i despise the most are out of the playoffs, westbrook is about to get traded after this yr and mike brown goes to LA to implement his lebroffense? The basketball gods have spoken. lakers, welcome to 4 yrs of irrelevance.

Wow, this will work out well for me.  I hate the Lakers, so down, down they go!
tomtom Posted: May.25 at 5:02 pm
Guess i cant cry about this forever. Atleast we will be playing some D in 2012.
Donttrust Sony Posted: May.25 at 5:10 pm
Wow.  People can make racist statements on here, but don’t call them out because the almighty and misguided moderators will alter your post as they see fit. At least man-up, and send an email explaining why you choose to post some of a reply and not all of it you cowards!
Donttrust Sony Posted: May.25 at 5:17 pm
bull22 makes statements based upon the color of someone’s skin.  You know what they call that?
Cool Dude Posted: May.25 at 5:19 pm
Oh ffs no.
ClydeSays Posted: May.25 at 5:23 pm
If Brown couldn’t handle LBJ, how is he going to coach Kobe?
Warrior Posted: May.25 at 5:43 pm
cant wait to see what kind of D Mike Brown will implement against his favorite player bronbron
Tae Posted: May.25 at 5:48 pm
Being a die hard Lakers fan, i have to accept it. But does this mean no more triangle??? Cus if Brown doesnt know it, its too complex to cram it in his head over tha summer and if they try to do that, theres a chance he could fail which means we fail. So does tha triangle stay or wat?
Tae Posted: May.25 at 5:51 pm
Where u at Black? I know u got tha news
Allenp Posted: May.25 at 6:10 pm
How does this happen?
baykusreyiz Posted: May.25 at 6:22 pm
lmao. la is done for good
nbk Posted: May.25 at 6:41 pm
Apparently it’s Jim Buss’ son, he made the decision and was “very impressed” with Mike Brown’s interview smh (how bout his BODY OF WORK!)
Royal Posted: May.25 at 6:55 pm
OK…..Hopefully he proves me and pretty much everyone wrong
Joel O's Posted: May.25 at 7:17 pm
Well. Mike Brown reached the Finals with Lebron and a bunch of nobodies. That’s not too bad. Give the guy a chance. It’s not like Doc Rivers had a FANTASTIC resume before he won that chip with Boston. Rivers’ greatest pre-championship achievement was guiding that scrappy Orlando team to the playoffs.
Waylonakolipse Posted: May.25 at 8:49 pm
Now the GSW can sign Brian Shaw.
LeBron de Con Posted: May.25 at 8:54 pm
Mike Brown rids himself of my jock strap around his nose so he can wear Kobe’s.
robb Posted: May.25 at 9:19 pm
It’s not gonna work.  Plain and simple.
hoodsnake Posted: May.25 at 9:34 pm
He will be fired before the allstar game (if there is an allstar game)
gregor Posted: May.25 at 9:36 pm
OH GOD NO D:
Holiday Posted: May.25 at 10:25 pm
The Lakers coaching position is a dead end right now and will be for a couple years, there old and on the decline plus the drama will ensue! The league won’t let there flagship team stay down long, and they won’t be terrible but Kobe won’t be around a whole lot longer and they’ve turned on Gasol, Fisher is at the end of the line. Odom is aging, Artest is past his prime… he (Mike Brown) should have lobbied for the Knicks job, ya know forced out D’Antoni!
Dacre Posted: May.25 at 10:55 pm
This will have repercussions similar to the Terry Porter hiring in Phoenix… Give it 1 month of ho-hum basketball in LA, where the Clippers will start the season with a better record than their older brother and Mike Brown will have to make sure he doesn’t let the door hit his shiny backside on th way out.
Dacre Posted: May.25 at 10:56 pm
Of course it makes sense. This is the kind of coach you hire when your not actually going to playing games [lockout].
Jukai Posted: May.25 at 11:19 pm
I’m totally willing to give him a shot. I’m just sure he’s going to fail.
O Posted: May.25 at 11:20 pm
I mean, he’s good on defense, and i’m sure part of the deal was to incorporate Jackson’s offensive schemes into this. If not, then it’s a wrap. I was kind of hoping the Knicks would hire him as a defensive coordinator.
Krishan Posted: May.26 at 12:24 am
One season, tops.
Harlem_World Posted: May.26 at 12:40 am
LMAO…Magic is going to slaughter this guy as soon as the losing kicks in.  Watch and see.

By the way, who gives one if he’s an african american coach. the only time it matters what race you are, is when you want to become president

Wayno Posted: May.26 at 1:17 am
WTF?!?! Dude, this is the first time I’ve checked any news (basketball related or other) since being on vacation and this is the first thing I see? What the hell is happening? My mind just exploded trying to think of legitimate explanations as to why this is a remoteley acceptable decision…
Yesse Posted: May.26 at 3:26 am
I hope Mike can prove me wrong, because i see nothing but negative things over this trade. I was expecting Brian Shaw.
Moose Posted: May.26 at 8:25 am
It’s hard for anyone to follow Jackson. Who would you have hired instead?
Riggs Posted: May.26 at 8:43 am
@yesse: what trade?
biged Posted: May.26 at 8:50 am
They better not loose any games next season or the fans in the crowd gonna start throwing stuff like they did in that game versus Cleveland… As a Lakers fan I understand the hate, But it wont be ALL that bad. Shaw can coach the offense and Brown can coach the defense. :/ We gotta think positive cause we can still win a ‘ship or two before Kobe retire. Lakers for Life
