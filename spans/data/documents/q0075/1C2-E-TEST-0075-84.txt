Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson , is a motorcycle riding, flip-flopping wearing, open-minded dude who once described his coaching philosophy as “having to do a lot with opening up your heart space and seeing people from where they’re at … having a lot of sympathetic ear to their plights as people.”
View full size Bill Haber, The Associated PressLos Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson doesn't seem to feel much at home amid the mildewed confines of New Orleans, where he is afraid to even drink the water.
But Jackson’s sympathies seldom seem to extend to New Orleans.
He has criticized the aroma of New Orleans, ridiculed the NBA’s effort to keep the Hornets here and attacked one of the team’s most prominent sponsors.
“I refuse to comment on the grounds that I might incriminate myself,” Jackson said of his feelings about New Orleans during a shootaround last Friday before Game 3. Before adding: “Just don’t drink the water.”
It’s not the first time Jackson has been so candid about his feelings, or lack thereof, for the Big Easy.
“Well, it smells better in Oklahoma,” Jackson dead-panned in 2006 when the New Orleans Hornets were cast to Oklahoma City in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . “I have to say I miss that mildew smell from New Orleans that permeates the air.”
But rest easy, New Orleanians. The Big Easy isn’t the only foil for Jackson’s musings. He once referred to Sacramento as “semi-civilized” and a “cow town.” He also cited San Antonio as a land of conventioneers and tourists. And he said Madison Square Garden, where he once toiled for the Knicks, reeked of “elephants.”
Jackson it seems, also thinks he’s in a win-win situation Thursday night even if his heavily-favored Lakers don’t win. He says every team in the league should claim a share of New Orleans’ success since, after all, the NBA owns the wayward franchise.
Chris Carlson, Associated Press'I have an unbiased and non-prejudicial view of New Orleans,' Jackson said post-Katrina. 'Iâve always had a wonderful time in the city. However, itâs tough for them to support NBA basketball.'
“If New Orleans happens to win a championship, does everybody get a trophy?” he quipped to the Los Angeles Times on Feb. 25.
But this isn’t Jackson’s usual jabs to “work a ref” for favorable calls, or to play psychological warfare with an opponent.
He seems unable to muster a kind word for New Orleans.
“I have an unbiased and non-prejudicial view of New Orleans,” Jackson said post-Katrina. “I’ve always had a wonderful time in the city. However, it’s tough for them to support NBA basketball.”
Heck, even the surroundings at the Arena tend to draw Jackson’s ire.
“We thought (the Harrah’s Casino placards) wasn’t a good message at all,” he said.
Then again, Jackson did give a tepid  nod of approval in the city’s first professional game after Katrina.
“Looks like the lights are on, electricity,” he told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. “The toilets are flushing great there in our locker room. Things are happening.”
