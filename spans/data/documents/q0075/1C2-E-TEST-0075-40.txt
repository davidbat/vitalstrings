LOS ANGELES (AP) — Lakers coach Mike Brown has left Staples Center shortly before tipoff for undisclosed personal reasons.
Assistant coach John Kuester coached the Lakers’ game against the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.
Brown is in his first season with the Lakers (37-22), who are in first place in the Pacific Division. He attended his regular pregame media gathering about 90 minutes before game time.
Kuester is a veteran NBA assistant who served as the Detroit Pistons’ head coach for two seasons from 2009-2011. He was fired by Detroit last June.
