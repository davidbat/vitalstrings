A Warm Welcome to Pat Schooley, our new Major Atom Coach for 2012-2013
Submitted By Karen Vollmer on Monday, March 26, 2012
Pat has been a lifelong resident of Stratford. He owns and operates his business in Stratford and resides there with his wife Erin and children, Jay, Ty, Kayden and Zach.
Over the past 30 years, Pat has 16 plus years of hockey coaching experience. In the past 10 years, he has coached from Novice to PeeWee in the Stratford Minor Hockey System. Other than his hockey coaching experience, Pat has also coached baseball at the Junior level, as well as Senior in a Semi-professional league for over 10 years.
With all of those experiences, as well as previously being involved with Hockey Skills Clinics, Hockey Schools, A Power Skating School and being a Spring Hockey Coach in recent years, Pat has numerous resources to draw from in order to make this 2012-13 season an enjoyable and successful season. Pat played hockey in Stratford from Minor Atom to Junior B and was fortunate to be coached by many who were not just hockey people, but, people who were willing to donate time, pass along knowledge and lead by example in order to better the children of the future.
Hockey is the vehicle that will be used to transport these children forward toward their future lives as strong, confident, disciplined and successful men and women.
EFFORT BREEDS SUCCESS!!!
