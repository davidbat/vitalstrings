If the Lakers are calling MWP their savior then they have some real problems. He canâ€™t play defense on the whole team.

Optimism, pessimism, F*CK THAT; we're gonna make it happen. As God as my bloody witness, I'm hell-bent on making it work.

MWP will give Gallo the hardest time, but this will also space out the others to make some shots
and cause a crowding with the lakers in the post. The Lakers size advantage is also their downfall, we know we cannot outmatch them with sheer strength so we rely on agility and athleticism. If we shoot higher than 47% we win on Saturday. MWP is a man defender, and gets in trouble when he helps.
