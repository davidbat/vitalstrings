     Head Coach Steve Coury
     Lake         Oswego Football is one of the elite high school football programs in the         state of Oregon and is  led by Head Coach Steve Coury.  Coach Coury's         extended football background and "family" philosophy is the         reason that Lake Owego has become one of the most successful programs         over the last 11 years. 
     Coach Coury attended Oregon State University from 1977 - 1980 after         graduating from Lakeridge High School.  At Oregon State, Steve         gained national recognition for being 2nd Team All-American and 2nd in         the Nation in receiving his Senior year. He was also 1st team all- Pac         10, all West Coast, played in the Shrine All-Start Game and the Blue         Gray all star game.  Steve then went on and played for in the         Canadian football league for Ottawa in 1980.
     Steve started his coaching career in 1981 at Crespi HS in Southern         Cal.  From their he went on to the USFL from 82-84, University of         Pittsburgh from 85-87 and became the Head Coach of Lake Oswego in         1992.  Since 1992, LO has a record of 85 wins and 32 losses, been         to the state playoffs 11 of 13 years, won or shared 4 Three Rivers League         Championships, and played in the State Championship game in 2002.  Coach Coury has also been the Three Rivers league coach of the year in         1999, 2000, and 2001 and has been the Head Coach of North All-Star team         in the Les Schwab Bowl two times.
     "Treat others as you would like to be treated," and "we         have to love each other like family,"  are what you will hear         from Steve Coury if you are part of the football program.  These         are more than just clichés but  the foundations of the program         philosophy and what the Coaches and players believe are part of the         success that they have.   It is through this philosophy that         the players and coaches have built the Laker program to what it is         today.   It is also the belief that it  will lead them to         a State title and more importantly to make them young men of integrity.
