How to Become a Lakers Cheerleader
Showtime Years
In 1979 , a young point guard nicknamed Magic Johnson was drafted by the Lakers out of Michigan State University . In his rookie season, the talented point guard with the support of Hall-of-Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would lead the team to the NBA Championship against Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers . The franchise would enjoy a second dynasty, with championships in 1980 , 1982 , 1985 , 1987 and in 1988 . With it's high octane, fast paced offense and the passing skills of the creative, 6'9" point guard, the media would refer to the wildly, popular spectacle and this period as Showtime.
Shaq, Kobe, and Phil
After the untimely retirement of Magic Johnson due to his acquisition of the HIV virus , the Lakers would endure an awkward transition process from championship contender to pretender. That would change in 1996 with the signing of NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal , and the acquisition of a little known high school superstar by the name of Kobe Bryant . For three years the team struggled to find it's form, displaying spurts of greatness but never putting it all together for a legitimate championship run. In 1999 , the Lakers signed Phil Jackson as Head Coach. The architect of six NBA Championships with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls , Jackson was considered the final piece to return the Lakers to championship form and he did not disappoint. During his tenure the team enjoyed a three year run as NBA Champions in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 .
