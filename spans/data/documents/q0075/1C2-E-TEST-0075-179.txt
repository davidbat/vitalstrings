MTO you are reaching yet again in order to fill space on your site. There is nothing in those pictures to indicate Doc Rivers was about to beat up Jack Nicholson. Get real!

Stop making [EXPLETIVE] up. They were laughing, but your still shots don't show that.
ShortThicknRed
No one gave a damn about the Celtics until now. Fake azz fans. SMH.
orchidjones
waiting for the fakers, i mean lakers to change their name to the QUAKERS after those gay a$$3ed pictures Kobe took... sit yo' ole a$$ down Ji-ji-ji- JACK!  its green all day!  Celtics... 2 more hands needed for 4 THUMBS UP JESUSE SHUTTLESWORTH!
chi-hop
i disagree with u shortthicknred. it"s not just about the celtics it"s the fact that folks like myself are tired of celebrity laker fans jumping on the court arguing calls and shyt and treating the games like an academy award show their arrogance is very annoying and as far as chicago peeps the celtics got 2 people from chicago the head coach doc rivers and michael finey and kevin garnett has very strong ties to chicago even graduated high school in chicago so i think u wrong.
iLuvMTO
lol jack nicholson ALWAYS there he go hard! he a real lakers fan unlike all these bandwagon bytches.
im rootin for the celts, allen and rondo were beasts last night!
iLuvMTO
