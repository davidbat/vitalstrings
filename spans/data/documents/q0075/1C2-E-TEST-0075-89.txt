Better listen to Kobe
Los Angeles Lakers head coach Mike Brown has been suspended one game without pay and fined $25,000 for making contact with a game official and failure to leave the court in a timely manner following his ejection, it was announced today by Stu Jackson, NBA Executive Vice President Basketball Operations.
The incident occurred with 8:41 remaining in the fourth quarter of the Lakersâ€™ 96-87 loss to the Utah Jazz at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City on Feb. 4.
Brown will serve his suspension Monday when the Lakers play the Philadelphia 76ers at Wells Fargo Center.
