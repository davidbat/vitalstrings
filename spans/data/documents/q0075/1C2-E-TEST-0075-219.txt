OHIO LAKER BASKETBALL
Welcome,
Let me take a chance to introduce myself and the Ohio Laker program. We have been involved in AAU/Travel Team basketball for over 10 years.  Since the beginning, we have been very successful in building a quality program that gives boys and girls grades 5-11, the opportunity to play competitive basketball during the months of April and May.  Our program has been beneficial for players at various skill levels. We don’t consider our program an all-star only program. We have seen players use the spring and the extra 20-30 games and practices to move up the depth chart and be a contributor. We have had players in our program go from freshman team to starting varsity as well as good JV players improve to leading their Varsity team the next season. Currently, there are over 100 young men and women that have combined great high school careers and their travel team experience with the Ohio Lakers to continue their careers at college level.  
We are excited  this year  will have a huge turnout at all levels and skills. Players are starting to play more AAU/Travel Team basketball to help improve their skills during the spring before the start of their summer programs. Our program consists basically of one/two practices a week and 5-6 weekend tournaments during the months of April and May. The last tournaments for both boys and girls are finished by Memorial Day weekend.
 
Teams               are comprised of 8-12 players. We budget everything for 10 players.
Teams               will play in 5-6 tournaments during April and May.
Teams               will practice 1-2 times a week.
The cost of the program is $300-350.  We are the cheapest program in the area.
Team                 practices will take place at various high schools in the Columbiana                 County area. Last year, we practiced at Leetonia, Lisbon, United, South Range and Sebring High Schools
The               tournaments are in the Akron/Canton/Cleveland/Pittsburgh areas. Some teams may               choose to go away to overnight tournaments.
Players from Ohio               are limited to two players per team/per school in grades 7-11, there is an exception that two 8th graders and two 9th graders from the same school can play on the same team.   The OHSAA considers 8th and under seperate from grades 9-12.  Grades 5 & 6 can have more than two from the same school. Players from Pennsylvania and West Virgina are not limited to the same rules.
