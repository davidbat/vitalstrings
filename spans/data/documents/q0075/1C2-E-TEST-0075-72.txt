Typical living in Orange County v. LA County debate.  Anyone south of South Coast Plaza finds LA County to be Boyz and the Hood.  Anyone who favors living in LA County doesn’t know that life exists south of the South Bay Area.  I live in between, and Mike Brown lives in a neighborhood not that far away.  He has multiple freeway options to get to Staples and the practice facility and none of them have to deal with the 405.

I’d agree with you except that I find the South Bay to be tragic. At least for me. And you’re right there are a number of freeway options but what freeway is going to get him to the El Segundo practice facility minus traffic?
Quality of life issues withstanding, the travel time in a new city known for traffic and him going into the heart of congestion for his work. Well it seems to add an extra level of stress. Again that’s simply my opinion.
