Shaquille O’Neal, in his recent published book, “Shaq Uncut: My Story,” suggests then-Cavaliers coach Mike Brown treated LeBron James differently than other players . During one film session, O’Neal says, Brown criticized Mo Williams for not getting back on defense just after a play in which James also showed a lack of hustle. O’Neal wondered whether Brown, as new coach of the Lakers, would deal with Kobe Bryant in a similar fashion.
“I’m not sure if Kobe is going to listen to Mike Brown,” Shaq says in the book. “LeBron never really did. Here’s what we do know: Kobe will definitely be in charge.”

But after a poor effort by the Lakers in their preseason game against Clippers on Monday, Brown called out Kobe specifically . “Defensively, Kobe was just as guilty as everybody else,” Brown said.
Kobe seems to understand the coach-player relationship, and says he does not expect to be treated differently because of his star status.
"That's his job,” Bryant told ESPNLosAngeles.com . “I'd be upset if he was just letting me skate through things. You make mistakes and the coach's responsibility is to point those out. If he can't point that out to me, he has no chance of pointing that out to anybody else."
Bryant added of Brown, "What I've heard about him (before this season) was he was a pushover, he doesn't say what he's thinking and all this other sorts of stuff. I haven't seen that at all. He's been the complete opposite."
"I look at it as coaching and that's what (Lakers owner) Dr. (Jerry) Buss pays me to do," Brown told ESPN. "He pays me to coach this team and if I was afraid to coach this team, I shouldn't be here. It's as simple as that."
