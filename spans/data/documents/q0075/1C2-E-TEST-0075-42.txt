According to Matt Steinmetz , who is an NBA reporter for CSN Bay Area, two NBA sources have confirmed that Mike Brown will be the Lakers Head Coach.
Here is what Steinmetz had to say in his report :
Brown, the former coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, is  expected to be named the new coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, according  to two league sources.
Brown was considered a frontrunner for the Warriors’ job, but is  expected to sign a four-year contract worth approximately $18 million  with the Lakers — succeeding Phil Jackson as coach.
An earlier Yahoo report noted that a close league friend told Yahoo! Sports that, “He really wants this [the Lakers job] to happen.”
Mike Brown had five successful seasons as the Cleveland Cavaliers  head coach, including a trip to the NBA Finals. Brown, was fired in 2010  after five seasons in Cleveland, where he went 272-138.
Brown also won the Coach of the Year award after the 2008-2009 season.
