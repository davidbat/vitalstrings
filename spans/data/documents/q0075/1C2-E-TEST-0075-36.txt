Before tipoff against the Denver Nuggets at Staples Center on Friday night, the Los Angeles Lakers learned that Coach Mike Brown had left the building for personal reasons. The team already knew that they’d be without superstar Kobe Bryant for a fourth consecutive game against the Nuggets, but Brown leaving just before game time was a surprise to say the least.
According to Mike Bresnahan of the L.A. Times , Mike Brown went through the motions before the game against the Nuggets and then left Staples Center:
Mike Brown is not coaching the Lakers tonight against Denver because of personal reasons, according to the team.
Brown went through his regular pregame briefing with media members about 90 minutes before tipoff but left after that.
He was somewhat late for the briefing, spoke for 10 minutes and left Staples Center for home soon after that.
Assistant John Kuester is coaching in Brown’s place. Kuester took Brown’s spot earlier this season in Philadelphia, a game the Lakers lost, 95-90.
So at this point in time, it is uncertain what has happen with Mike Brown. It would be safe to say that something has occurred within Brown’s family and it had to be attended to immediately.
In the meantime, assistant coach John Kuester will take over for Mike Brown on the Lakers’ coaching staff.
