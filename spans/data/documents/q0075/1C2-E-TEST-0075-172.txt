Gregg Popovich Rips Pau Gasol Trade
By Larry Brown February 10, 2008 - Posted in Basketball
It was only a matter of time before someone said what everyone was thinking — the Lakers ripped the Grizzlies off.  They acquired a premium player like Pau Gasol, who pretty much single-handedly got the Grizzlies into the playoffs a few times, for the likes of nearly nothing.  Kwame Brown, Javaris Critenton, Pau’s brother Marc , and a pair of first-round picks isn’t exactly a king’s ransom.  About the only thing there worth any value would be the draft picks, but you figure the Lakers are getting Pau so those picks will probably be late first-round, like 25th or so.  So when you think about it, what did the Lakers give up?  Not a whole lot.  And that’s what makes Spurs coach Gregg Popovich so peeved :
“What they did in Memphis is beyond comprehension,” said Popovich. “There should be a trade committee that can scratch all trades that make no sense. I just wish I had been on a trade committee that oversees NBA trades. I’d like to elect myself to that committee. I would have voted no to the L.A. trade.”
I wonder what he has to say about the Shaq trade huh?  Guess Pop feels a bit threatened — as well he should.  The Spurs might be the defending champions, but now the Lakers provide some serious competition.  I’ll still give the nod to San Antonio, but the gap has certainly closed.  The playoffs are going to be quite exciting, to say the least.
