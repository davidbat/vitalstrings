Bibliographies
NNDB has added thousands of bibliographies for people, organizations, schools, and general topics, listing more than 50,000 books and 120,000 other kinds of references. They may be accessed by the "Bibliography" tab at  the top of most pages, or via the "Related Topics" box in the sidebar. Please feel free to suggest books that might be critical omissions.
