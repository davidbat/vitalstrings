'Very spiritual, very intellectual' Jackson a heady head coach

SAN ANTONIO  Even at 62, Phil Jackson still appears built a bit like the tin man from the Wizard of Oz. With squared-off shoulders and a slightly disjointed, creaky looking gait, the Los Angeles Lakers coach ambles into his hotel lobby along the city's river walk using his favored prop these days: a hand-carved gentleman's walking cane, one of his few concessions.
The coach avoids eye contact as he walks onto an unoccupied balcony overlooking water. Jackson, who cherishes nature, looks not for an unspoiled view. He only wants what his personality gravitates toward — the solitary nature of his soul.
"I know that, sometimes, I'm not a friendly, outgoing, social (being)," Jackson says when asked if he intimidates by sheer size with his elongated 6-8 frame and Pterodactyl-like wingspan. "I'm more of an introspective person. I know that's standoffish. It's just shyness."
On this day, he is anything but cranky as he gregariously swaps stories. Tonight is Game 4 of the Western Conference finals vs. the San Antonio Spurs. His Lakers are within two wins of what would be Jackson's 11th trip to the NBA Finals in 17 seasons as a head coach.
With nine titles as a coach, tying him for most in league history with his late, great Boston Celtics gadfly Red Auerbach, Jackson engenders a rare reverence from players.
"His size (makes him daunting)," Lakers guard Derek Fisher says. "At times, it's the way he carries himself. There are some days when you walk into practice, maybe he's so ingrained in thought … guys don't know if he's approachable.
"Phil has the uncanny ability to let players be who they are and get the best out of them. He believes in the freedom to speak your mind.
"He kind of keeps us guessing, wondering by keeping that distance a head coach needs sometimes. There's a certain way that he pokes and prods … pushes but backs off … expects but accepts."
Jackson says: "It's like riding a horse. You can't manhandle it. You have to let him have his own way."
Jim Cleamons, a Lakers assistant coach, says his boss gives players respect and, in turn, they listen.
"When there is harmony, there is productivity, joy, contentment," Cleamons says. "Without being corny, there's a lot of Zen."
Jackson is more than mere armchair philosopher who practices a holistic approach to pro basketball. Never mind his meditation techniques — the towering counterculture figure has been a transcendental NBA coach for nearly two decades, winning 70% of all games.
"He is a very unique coach and person," forward Pau Gasol says. "He's very spiritual, very intellectual. You can learn a lot from him. He also has a great sense of humor."
At halftime of Sunday's 103-84 loss to the Spurs, Craig Sager, TNT's sartorially splashy reporter, asked Jackson what upset him. "You know what really bothers me? My tie matches your suit."
Gaining perspective
Jackson lost some jocularity after the franchise's last title in 2002. Some of it was caused by a painful and debilitating arthritic hip and back condition. He had a second hip-replacement surgery last June.
"He never complains — that's his old-school mentality," Lakers assistant coach Brian Shaw says.
However, the source of his greatest anguish could not be found on an MRI scan. There was internal team dissension, messy feuds with superstar guard Kobe Bryant . In 2004, he endured his first Finals defeat. His contract was not renewed.
Jackson turned globetrotter. "I was flying commercial and carrying my bags. You realize this (NBA) life has a lot of cushions, (but) the in-the-box living we do grates against my maverick nature. When I came back, I was appreciative. This year, I've been pain-free. So I'm in a better mood with my players, rather than being Mr. Grouchy."
He was rehired in 2005, but the young team was bounced from the playoffs in the first round two years in a row. This season, the Lakers won 57 games and a division title.
Still, most of his Lakers were in grade school when he won his first NBA crown in 1991. Once, he misidentified Denver Nuggets guard Allen Iverson to his team as "Tiny" Archibald. Nate Archibald played against Jackson in the '70s.
One day, he told the team he was concerned it was moving at only 33 rpms. Blank stares. His iPod-carrying players had no clue his analogy related to outdated vinyl records.
Generational turnovers aside, Jackson's strengths as a coach are his basketball IQ, patience and resolve, and management skills. Oh, he also has a piercing whistle.
Jackson has a knack for probing the opposition's mind-set and understanding what his team needs. He encourages non-starters to stay engaged, and he plays them.
"He has vision of so many things," assistant Kurt Rambis says.
Perhaps because of his historical stature, Jackson is a lanky bulls-eye for detractors — an opportunist who created his legend riding four great NBA stars: Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in Chicago and Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in L.A.
"A lot of people don't like to give him the credit," Fisher says. "I don't know everybody's perception, but I think he's polarizing. (Many) give him love and respect. Others feel he doesn't deserve it because Michael and Shaq and everyone else did all the work. To think it's an accident that he has coached all these championship teams is ridiculous."
Jackson chiefly attributes his rings to the "Triangle" offense and, yes, that fabulous quartet, none of whom had won an NBA championship pre-Phil. "I've had four guys who were spectacular players."
Jack Ramsay, the retired coach who works for ESPN Radio, says, "People think he's pompous and aloof. And he may be some of each of those. But I've never heard anyone say Phil Jackson cannot coach."
Unique timeout technique
On the bench, and in news conferences, he sits on an elevated chair, an allowance for weakened joints. More like a throne in terms of height, it gives him an exalted position, one Jackson has earned.
He is the only coach in NBA history to lead teams to three consecutive titles three times (Chicago twice and Los Angeles once).
The most important influences on Jackson's coaching philosophies were the late Red Holzman, his New York Knicks coach, and former Kansas State coach Tex Winter, 86. He taught Jackson the "Triangle."
"I used to say to him, 'Coach, you've got (only) 15 minutes for this meeting, and we're sittin' here meditating when I could be giving chalk-talks,' " Winter says. "He would say, 'No, this is important.' "
Sometimes, Jackson will burn a sage rope, waving it in the locker room, telling players that he is driving out bad thoughts, Shaw says.
"He wants everyone to get to a point like the frog on the lily pad," he says. "The frog's sitting perfectly still, relaxed but alert. A fly goes by and, without moving, the frog flicks his tongue and snatches it. Then he's right back in position. He's trying to get everybody to get there."
Yet, at a recent practice, some Lakers offered excuses about how a team was countering defensive schemes. Jackson piped up: "You know what Red Holzman used to say? 'We need this guy stopped. I don't care what you do.' "
Jackson uses timeouts even more judiciously than many miserly coaches, particularly when it comes to offensive breakdowns.
"There he sits, legs crossed (and arms folded)," Ramsay says. "Anybody else — me — would jump up and say, 'Timeout! Timeout!' He wants them to figure it out. I don't know any other coach ever who has used that technique."
Craig Hodges, who played for Jackson with the Bulls and is a Lakers special assistant coach, says the coach's philosophy is this: " 'You got yourself in this mess, now get yourself out.' Then there will be times when you think he's going to explode and (he's) docile. That's the beauty of Phil's psychology."
He even used it dealing with Auerbach, an irascible sort who thought Jackson was perched too high atop his horse. Jackson's fondest reminiscence of the Celtics great is from his CBA coaching days in Albany, N.Y. Jackson drove his family 150 miles to Boston for a game in 1986. "Red turns around and says, 'I see you still haven't shaved that damn beard.' "
With that, Jackson's eyes scrunch up and he laughs … last.
