After spending the last couple seasons wearing models from Nike's Brave series , it's expected that Tony Parker would return to the San Antonio Spurs this season lacing up Player Exclusive colorways of the brand new Lunar Hypergamer . The good news for Parker and Spurs fans is that two Parker PEs will be made available retail, including this silver-based "home" make-up arriving at select accounts now.
The shoe features a metallic silver Hyperfuse-constructed upper with s tonal camouflage print wrapped around the toebox and heel. Black handles Swoosh branding, the laces and mesh along the collar, while the interior is lined with a black and silver camo print. The Lunarlon-cushioned midsole is done in black and sits atop a grey rubber outsole to cap off the look.
Look for the Parker PE Hypergamers to hit retailers like Eastbay in the coming weeks or stop by eBay to pick up a pair from unitedsw00sh.
Color: Metallic Silver/Black
