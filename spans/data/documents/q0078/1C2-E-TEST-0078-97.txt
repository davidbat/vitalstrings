we cant say whether or not hes progressing this year yet because neither of us have seen him. however, howland has personally said that smith has come back much more motivated and hardworking. ï»¿ i myself am not a josh smith fan, but we cant condemn him before he steps on the court. the allegations were about a couple players that didnt take the game seriously, and obviously the program suffered. ucla is still the greatest basketball program of all time, and this will keep the recruits coming.
