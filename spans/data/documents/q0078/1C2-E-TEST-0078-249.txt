EVA LONGORIA DIVORCE Final, Love After Marriage, Who is Tony Parker Dating Now?
Eva Longoria’s divorce was finalized today. The Desperate Housewive , kicked her ex husband Tony Parker to the curb after he was caught cheating with Erin Barry, a NBA teammates wife.  The couple spent seven years together but unfortunately for Eva Longoria, her hubby Tony Parker had a wandering eye. Will Eva find love again?
The divorce was quick and painless, with the marital assets being divided equally. It was reported that Tony Parker begged his ex wife Eva Longoria to take him back but she said no. Why go a second time on emotional love rollercoaster. As they say, once a cheater always a cheater.
Today, Tony Parker released the following statement:  “It is with great sadness that after seven years together, Eva and I have decided to divorce,” Parker said in a statement at the time. “We love each other deeply and pray for each other’s happiness.”
Now that Eva Longoria a Pisces girl is on the market, who should she date next? Astrochicks recommends staying away from the athletes, you just can’t trust them. I think Halle Berry’s smokin hot baby daddy, Gabriel Aubry would make a good match. He’s born under the sign of Virgo, down to earth, smart and sexy. We think he would make a wonderful boyfriend and they would have beautiful babies.
Astrologically, we think that Eva Longoria will bounce back quickly. The stars are aligned for her next year and I think she will find a new love. Wishing her lots of love and happiness. Stay tuned.
