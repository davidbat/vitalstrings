TONY Parker has been “taking refuge in basketball” since splitting with Eva Longoria in November.
The 28-year-old sportsman is going through “difficult” times dealing with his marriage split from the actress — who he wed in July 2007 — but is doing his best to stay strong by throwing himself into his work as a member of the San Antonio Spurs basketball team.
“The most important thing is to stay strong mentally, even if these are very difficult times,” te told the Le Parisien newspaper.
“I’ve taken refuge in basketball because that’s what I’ve done best since my youth.”
Despite his personal struggles, Tony is trying to stay focused on his career and is particularly glad to have the support of his teammates, friends and family in making it easier to deal with the split.
“I am, first of all, a basketball player. I’ve done this for so very long,” he said.
‘For me, it’s been essential to be successful on the court. It feels good to have the support of my teammates, coaches and San Antonio, but the most important thing is my family. In moments like these, your whole family becomes closer to you.”
He added he has not been reading any media coverage of his divorce — filed in November and cited as being for “irreconcilable differences” in court papers — but friends insist he has been affected by the scrutiny.
“He has changed. He’s extremely guarded when he talks about it,” a source said.
