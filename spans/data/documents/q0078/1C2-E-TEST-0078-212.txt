Tony Parker: Cheating on Eva Longoria With Teammate's Wife?!

The Eva Longoria-Tony Parker divorce is shocking in itself. Reports of Tony cheating? Astounding. Reports that it was with a teammate's wife? Mind-blowing.
Eva has officially filed to divorce him, and even though she's the one who filed the legal documents, sources say the Desperate Housewife is "devastated."Â 
Seeking spousal support and citing "irreconcilable differences," Eva filed the papers in L.A. County Superior Court. Now here's where it really gets bad ...
Her friend Mario Lopez of Extra says Longoria told him she found hundreds of text messages to the NBA star's phone from the wife of one of his teammates.
The woman's identity has not been revealed at this time, nor was the name of the San Antonio Spurs teammate. But that does narrow it down considerably.
Longoria also says that Tony Parker cheated on her earlier in their marriage and that he kept in touch with the woman on Facebook, according to Lopez.
Who could it be? Tim Duncan or Manu Ginobili maybe? While the latter's wife just had a baby (twins in fact), that didn't stop A-Rod or David Boreanaz.
It's not Richard Jefferson... he left his fiancee and might be gay. A dark horse? Gary Neal, who signed this summer and got married right before that.
Stay tuned, and share your theories below!
