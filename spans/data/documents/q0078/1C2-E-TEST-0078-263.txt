Tony Parker Accused of Cheating with Alexandra Paressant
Alexandra Paressant, a french model pictured below, is claiming Tony Parker continued an affair with her two months after marrying Eva Longoria. Alexandra said:
"We had room service. He said that Eva sexually speaking does not want to do certain things. She do [sic] not want to make love in front of a mirror, does not like certain position, and thinks that sperm gives acne."
Alexandra claims to have attended Parker’s wedding with French soccer player Thierry Henry on July 17. Alexandra alleges that after months of phone calls and text messages, she had a September rendezvous in Paris with Tony while he was in town to receive the Legion of Honor, and again in San Antonio in October. She alleges they even met at the Park Hyatt in Paris, the same hotel where Eva’s wedding party stayed. Alexandra sounds like a desperate model who is desperate to get some attention for her flagging career. She seems to like a lot of San Antonio Spurs.

Rumors about infidelity aren’t one-sided. Insiders close to Eva told Star magazine this week that they’re getting suspicious about the amount of time she spends with former flame Mario Lopez. When asked about Tony and the model, Eva’s rep said they had "no comment at this time."
Maybe they have an open marriage. Eva spends Tony’s money like water, and Tony has a pretty wife. Are these two even in love?
The couple’s rep said the allegations of cheating are “completely, 100 percent false and untrue.”
In a statement to People, Parker said, “I love my wife. She’s the best thing in my life, and I have never been happier.” Meanwhile, Eva tells the mag, “Tony has been nothing short of the perfect husband.”
