Not only did Tony Parker emotionally cheat on his wife Eva Longoria with the wife of a Spurs’ teammate, he may have sexted another woman. A 19-year-old British model has come forward claiming that the NBA star constantly sexted her, including sending half-naked pictures of himself. Sophia Egeler says that the two met at an Ultimate Fighting show at the O2 Area in London and Parker immediately began pursuing her. She says:
“From the minute he met me he was trying it on. I had no idea he was Eva Longoria’s husband. He would not take no for an answer and was telling me how much he liked me.”
When the NBA star finally convinced her to join him at the London nightspot, Whisky Mist, she said, “I decided at 1 A.M. I wanted to leave but Parker followed me into the street. He begged me to come back to a house he claimed was his. I said ‘no.’”
I didn’t think Tony had it in him!!
