San Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker celebrated Valentine's Day, a win over the New Jersey Nets -- and his divorce -- by canoodling with a brunette at Tao on East 58th Street. Parker was dining and drinking champagne with friends while "kissing and hugging the girl at the table," said a witness. The ex-husband of Eva Longoria and the beauty continued partying at Greenhouse, where onlookers saw more flirting and kissing. Parker and the mystery woman left separately near 4 a.m. Parker's rep said, "He had a fun night out with friends."
