"Desperate Housewives" actress Eva Longoria filed for divorce Wednesday from Parker in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing "irreconcilable differences."
However, sources connected to Parker tell TMZ that Parker was planning to file divorce papers in San Antonio, but Longoria "talked him out of it because she wanted to file in Los Angeles."
Sources close to Longoria deny that, saying the couple was trying to work things out up until the papers were filed, according to TMZ.
San Antonio television station KENS 5 reported Thursday that the 38-year-old Barry filed divorce papers, stating that he and his wife Erin "ceased to live together as husband and wife."
Longoria, 35, said she found hundreds of text messages from Erin Barry on Parker's cell phone, according to OK! Magazine. She also claimed that Parker cheated with another woman earlier in their three-year marriage.

Parker, a 28-year-old native of France, has played point guard for the Spurs since 2001, winning three NBA titles during that span. He played in the team's win over Chicago Wednesday, scoring 21 points and dishing out seven assists.
In past seasons, Longoria usually sat across from the Spurs' bench at the team's home games, but had not been seen in the arena this season.
Parker and Barry played together in San Antonio from 2004 to 2008. Barry retired after being released by Houston in Oct. 2009 and now works as an analyst for NBA TV.
