Tony Parker Has a New Girlfriend

*And it’s on to the next for SanAntonio Spurs guard Tony Parker. The NBA vet is now dating a 20-year-old pageant queen Barbara Morel.
After divorcing his wife, “Desperate Housewives” star Eva Longoria the end of last year, the athlete is back to being happy again. The 29 year old’s new young love was the winner of the first Miss Nationale pageant last December. She kind of looks like his ex (see below).
Parker was also in a little media trouble recently when he told a French newspaper he thought the Spurs’ chances of winning a title were out of the question by now. But he later recanted the statement after receiving a bit of backlash in America.
