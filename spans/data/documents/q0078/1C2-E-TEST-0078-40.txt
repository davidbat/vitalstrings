Once one of Hollywood's most celebrated couples, Eva Longoria and Tony Parker no longer speak.
The Desperate Housewives beauty makes this revelation on Thursday's edition of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she reveals the lessons that came out of her very public break-up with the San Antonio Spurs point guard.
"For me, being a woman, I realized you cannot identify yourself through a man or through your marriage ... or through a partner. I think it’s our nature to be socially constructed that way. To just be inferior or subservient and you don’t have to be."
"You can be yourself and really hold your own by yourself no matter what partnership you’re in,” Longoria said.
Ellen responded, "Because when things -- or if -- I shouldn’t say when ...
"[In] Hollywood, it’s when," Longoria chimed in.
"But if things don’t work out ... then you feel lost," Ellen said.
The 36-year-old actress said everyone's been telling her she looks younger and better than she ever has.
"I’m going, 'Wow!' I think divorce agrees with me!" Longoria said.

Ellen asked Longoria, “You and Tony are friendly: Do you still talk?” to which Longoria responded, “No.”
Parker and Longoria wed in 2007, three years after they were introduced following a Spurs game in 2004. They announced they were splitting in November 2010, and finalized it in January 2011.
The interview airs on Thursday's edition of Ellen; Desperate Housewives’ new season premieres Sunday, September 25 at 9/8c.
