Coach K must really want Tony Parker for his 2012 recruiting class.
The Duke head coach was reportedly waiting for the 6-foot-9 Parker on Monday after the latter returned from his weekend official visit to UCLA.
“Coach Krzyzewski just reaffirmed that he’d like have Tony in a Duke uniform,” Miller Grove coach Sharman White told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . “Colleges are allowed to see a player three times in the NCAA contact period. [Krzyzewski] said he rarely uses all three of them but he did with Tony because he’s a top priority.”
Parker has taken officials to Ohio State and UCLA and will trip to Duke Oct. 28. He said he is still considering five schools — Duke, Ohio State, Memphis, Georgetown and UCLA — despite a report indicating he cut two schools.
“It was great to see Coach K; he has been recruiting me since the ninth grade,” Parker told the AJC. “He’s one of the most powerful names in college basketball, and I appreciate him visiting with me and my parents.”
According to the report, Coach K stayed for three hours to talk hoops with Parker.
Kansas coach Bill Self is also trying to get involved and stopped by Miller Grove last week.
