Impact: Parker's cornea was scratched in the fight, and the San Antonio Spurs guard has revealed he had to have an operation to remove a shard that had "penetrated 99 percent" of his left eye. Parker says "I almost lost my eye." He did not join the rest of France's team Wednesday and will see a specialist in New York when he is cleared to take long-haul flights after July 5.
