For those who don’t recognize those acronyms, that’s Arizona Comic Mini Expo and Free Comic Book Day.  I’ll be at the ACME Art Show at Gotham Comics in Mesa, AZ Friday night starting at 7 pm, and at the main show Saturday for Free Comic Book Day at Samurai Comics on Saturday from 11am-5pm.  Come on by, and see some work that hasn’t been seen by eyes other than mine.  See ya there!

I have a two page spread in the upcoming Dark Horse book Conan: A Phoenix on the Sword #4.  It’s in the back of the book, and is actual drawn size, if not a bit larger.  Pick it up for the story, stay for the pinup!
Seattle was amazing.

HUGE thanks to Emerald City Comicon for hosting me in Seattle this last weekend, and the Pacific Northwest in general.  I had an AMAZING time, and hope to make it back next year.  Thank you to everyone who dropped by my booth, if nothing else to say hi.  The attendees there were incredibly nice, and a joy to be around.  Thank you again for making me feel so welcome!
Emerald City Comicon!

I’ll be at Emerald City Comicon this next weekend (March 30-April 1st).  If you’re in the Pacific Northwest, drop on by.  I’ll have some brand new prints, as well as newly available original art, and hugs.  Drop by table P-12 and witness them all.  I’ll also be doing a bowling event for the HERO Initiative Friday night at  http://www.garagebilliards.com/ .  Check with the HERO Initiative at the show for details, but crazy awkward fun will be had by all.
