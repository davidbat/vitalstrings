Eva Longoria and Tony Parker are officially divorced.
The three-year marriage ended in a courtroom appearance in Texas last week that shut the door rather quickly on the legal debacle that spanned two states.
The 35-year-old "Desperate Housewives" star filed for divorce in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, citing "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for calling it quits. But the revelation that her NBA star husband allegedly exchanged flirty text messages with a teammate's wife went public around the same time, with Parker filing for divorce two days later in Texas, where divorce is a bit more streamlined .
The couple did have a prenup that they signed before their fairy-tale wedding in July 2007 and updated two weeks later, according to People .
