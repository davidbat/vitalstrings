Add defending national champ UConn to the list of school vying for the services of elite 2012 prospect Tony Parker, a 6-foot-9, 270-pound center from Miller Grove High School in Lithonia, Ga.
“[Huskies coach Jim] Calhoun called me recently,” Parker told CBSSports.com. “I’ll sit down with my dad. They’re one of his favorite schools.”

Parker, one of the top uncommitted players left in the class of 2012, also is considering Kentucky, Duke, UCLA, Ohio State and Memphis. Kansas has shown interest as well.
“It’s getting closer, it’s starting to get hectic,” Parker said of his decision, which he plans to make in the spring. “But I don’t really feel any pressure.”
Parkier is Rivals.com's No. 33 overall rated player.
He says Kentucky recently has shown increased interest in him. Alex Poythress, Parker’s friend and AAU teammate, already has commited to John Calipari's squad.
“Their interest is good,” Parker told the website. “I get the Kentucky calls everyday from [Poythress], making sure I’m watching the game. It’s a great place.”
Parker also was positive about Ohio State, a program that has been recruiting him longer than many of the other programs.
“They’re a great program,” he said. “They do a lot with their bigs, which really works in my favor. They really recruit good around their bigs. I have a deep relationship with the coaching staff.”
