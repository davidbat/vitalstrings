One of my favorite players, dude is just a straight up whirlwind daredevil and still possesses the same speed he had years ago. What’s funny and shameful is that he’s finishes better in the paint than a player twice he’s size; DHow. Now what does that say about both players; you decide.

Agreed with JTaylor. TP’s ability to finish is uncanny. Not many players ever have had the same ability to finish of layups.

Every tony parker piece i’ve ever read from SLAM somehow finds a way to mention Eva

TP, he isnt as aged and declined as most people make out.
However, I would definitely pick Ginobili over Parker any day
davidR Posted: Sep.26 at 4:06 pm
tough call. i want to agree with overtime, but like dennis pointed out, it’s a contract year for tony.

Parker’s defensive play has slipped, but he’s still one of the better defenders on the Spurs. It also doesn’t help him that he averaged less than a steal a game last season. We’ll see if he can return to being a good defender next season, although that’s difficulty when he’s defending the deepest and best position in the entire league.  I don’t see what’s wrong with Parker being in the “shadow” of one of the 10 greatest players in NBA history. I’m sure Worth isn’t complaining about being in Magic’s “shadow,” McHale and Parish probably have no issue having been in Larry’s and Pippen is probably very grateful that he played alongside Michael Jordan. Well, I’m certain that Parker and Ginobili – who both are in Duncan’s supposed “shadow” – have no issue with Timmy and what they’ve accomplished together. I’m sure if Parker leaves S.A. it’ll have more to do with finding a city where he can continue to win and won’t have anything to do with find an identity.

article spent more time bashing him then justifying his spot at number 30.

Nothing new, TP is one of the most underated player of the league! One bad/injured season and people forget the killer he can be.
The guy is ONLY 28… (and can only get better in many areas even IF he looses some speed)
David Posted: Sep.26 at 8:41 pm
i agree with clayton. kind of seems hard to justify getting the 30 spot when the articles for everyone from #31-50 were a lot more positive.

Luuuv the man’s game, he was like a beast unleashed in the 08/09 season (a 55&10 statline against Minny for example), but he just never reclaimed that level of dominance last season, and his injuries (which started in the summer runup to the Euro Championships in Poland, where he still killed every challenger btw.) seemed to drain his confidence a bit. Hope he gets his mojo back, cause Tony Toni Toné sure is one of the best.

@meloman2.0: dude it’s eva…how can you NOT mention her?
But like most everyone says, why do I feel that this is not an article for someone who is No. 30 on this list? Other than the jokes about him and eva almost everything else is just a stab at him.

truely agree with overtime i would take ginobili over parker anytime even though ginobili is much older he seems much younger than mr.longoria
mtee Posted: Sep.27 at 8:16 am
JTaylor21..do u have to always mention Dwight in comments…please stop hating…damn it!
RoG23 Posted: Sep.27 at 11:05 am
Spurs can win another ring without TP, GHill on the FAAAST rise! But SA wont win another ring, in this era, without Manu.
