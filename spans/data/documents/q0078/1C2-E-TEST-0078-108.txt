Tony Parker laid out the hats of four possible college destinations on a table in front of him at a press conference Monday afternoon at Miller Grove High School (Ga.).
After a lengthy ceremony, Parker announced that he would head to Westwood and play for Ben Howland at UCLA.
The 6-9, 270-pound native of Lithonia, Ga., chose the Bruins over Ohio State, Kansas, Duke, Georgia, and Memphis.
This past season, Parker averaged 16.8 points, 11 rebounds, and three blocks per game for a Miller Grove (Ga.) team that finished 24-9.
Parker joins a UCLA team that has already scored signatures from Top 5 players Kyle Anderson of St. Anthony (N.J.) and Shabazz Muhammad of Bishop Gorman (Nev.). Jordan Adams of Oak Hill (Va.) is also signed to the class.
The addition of the big man Parker solidifies a Top 3 recruiting class in the country, up at the top with Kentucky and Arizona.
Korey McCray, who coached Parker in AAU, is on staff at UCLA as an assistant.
The Bruins are coming off a 19-14 season, including 11-7 in the Pac-12. They finished sixth in the conference.
