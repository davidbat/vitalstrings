Advice Parker's cornea was scratched in the fight, and the San Antonio Spurs guard has revealed he had to have an operation to remove a shard that had "penetrated 99 percent" of his left eye. Parker says "I almost lost my eye." He did not join the rest of France's team Wednesday and will see a specialist in New York when he is cleared to take long-haul flights after July 5.

Fantasy Analysis
Parker has rested some this season, however when he has been on the court, he has been tremendous. Fantasy owners still finishing out the season should keep him reserved for the final two games. However as soon as the post season begins, owners in all formats should get him in the lineup for postseason Fantasy leagues, as he remains a high-end option.
