I know Tony and Eva personally - she always complained that his penis was almost microscopic. It seems like a good reason to divorce him! Its sad - is there an operation that they could stretch it to 3-4 inches? Eva called it the "angry inch."

Who the hell marries a younger black athlet, Eva? You did it to yourself! It goes to show, that you are not intelligent enough to make the right choices. You could have had a fling with him, at most, but to marry? Even sistas know, that this kind of choice would not be smart, unless they are after money. But you? !

Who cares about the color of a individual skin. Brother you sound like a freaking fool. "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. " Dr. Martin L. King.
Many individuals of all races died in this struggle, died to achieve equality, died trying to end those bigot thoughts that weak minded individual such as yourself entertain. Whether you are a minority or a majority you should have the God given right to marry anyone that you chose regardless of the color of their skin. A person's skin color is not what makes you happy, their character, their morale's, heart and the way they were raised are contributions to the beginning of a happy relationship or marriage; as well as the belief in God, who is the foundation. Your statement was truly one of the unintellectual and ignorant! -- Tony Parker's cheating had nothing to do with the skin color of the woman he married, it had a lot to do with his character and morale's, period! Get a clue brother or get a brain, minorities have suffered enough from ignorant people thinking in the manner that you are, so why join those bigots by posting such stupidity!
