Tony Parker doesn't sound very optimistic about the future of the San Antonio Spurs .
Speaking to reporters in Paris on Wednesday, the Spurs star said that this season was their last chance and talked about his team's disappointing exit in the first round of the playoffs.
"At the start of the season I said this was our last chance,” he said. “Tim (Duncan) and Gino (Manu Ginobili) are getting old. It’s going to be tough to regenerate ourselves. We will always have a good team but we can no longer say that we’re playing for a championship.”
The Spurs dominated in the regular season and earned the top seed in the Western Conference. But they became the second No. 1 seed in NBA history to lose in the first round after the Memphis Grizzlies pulled off the miraculous upset.
Parker also said that if there is a lockout in the NBA, he will play in Europe . Scroll down to watch the video.
