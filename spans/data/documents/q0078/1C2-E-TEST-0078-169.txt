EVA LONGORIA DIVORCE UPDATE, Tony Parker Accuses Wife of Cheating Also!
Eva Longoria heartbroken after husband Tony Parker cheated, has decided to move forward with her divorce. For a brief moment, when the couple was spotted having lunch together, rumors swirled that Eva Longoria might forgive her San Antonio Spur.  Friends stating that Eva was sad over her husbands indiscretion, Tony Parker treated the divorce as business as usual. Not a romantic bone in his body.
Tony Parker trying to downplay his cheating, has reportedly said that Eva Longoria cheated on him too.  According to National Enquirer, Eva Longoria had a hot love affair during her marriage, with biking lothario Lance Armstrong. Didn’t Lance just have a baby? The Enquirer claims that’s what Tony Parker is telling close friends, Eva’s not so innocent herself. Of course he is, trying to get the heat off of him. Astrochicks doesn’t believe it.
Eva Longoria’s marriage fell apart after she found hundreds of sext messages between Tony Parker and his NBA teammates wife, Erin Barry. The two texters never consummated their relationship physically, but Tony reportedly admitted to Eva that he was “obsessed” with Erin Barry. The final straw was when Erin kept attending Tony Parker’s Spurs games.
For Eva Longoria, a Pisces girl, she will bounce back. Emotionally Eva’s very fragile at the moment but after the holidays she will find strength to move forward. Divorce is never easy but I don’t see Tony Parker changing his cheating ways either. Also, we seriously doubt Parker  will ever have a serious relationship with Erin Barry either. Eva Longoria’s better off, we predict a new love for her in 2012 and a fairytale ending. Stay tuned.
