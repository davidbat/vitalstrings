really? No interest at all in a player making moves on another player’s wife? this is kind of like Brady-Moynahan-Gisele, except w/ out the pregnancy.
To me, it’s the equivalent of people standing around laughing at a stranger who just slipped on some ice or took a tumble down some stairs.  We’re talking about human failure here (deceit and disrepect for someone you’ve made a commitment to) and it just seems distasteful  for people to treat it like it’s part of a show.  Hypothetically, if you were related to any of the people involved, would you post this?
we’ve got 4 guys here, all who excel at different things. Personally, i think this blog is as good as it’s ever been. diversified portfolio? diversified blog. you won’t like every post. nobody will.
I don’t disagree with any of this and I’m not trying to make this a conversation about my personal tastes.  I don’t recall ever bitching about a post not being worthwhile, and I even understand the potential benefits to you/the site for posts such as this one.  I was just suggesting that certain content plays to the dark side of people and I wanted to get your point of view as the author/editor.
I’m likely thinking way too hard about this but I always feel kind of greasy after reading stuff like this.
