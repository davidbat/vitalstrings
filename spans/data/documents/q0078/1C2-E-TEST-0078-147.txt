Key Storylines:
Tony grew up at the Parker family home with his                          father, Joe, mother, Alice, brother, Dennis and sister,                          Shirley. Joe was a career criminal and Tony looked up                          to him as an example of how to get through life. Joe was                          also a violent drunk, though, who hit Alice whenever she                          managed to upset him. Shirley Parker was so upset at the                          way her mother was treated that she moved out to live                          with her aunt. As Tony grew up, he became involved in                          petty crime and spent more time in boys' homes between                          the ages of 8 and 18 than he did at his actual home.
Tony meets David Palmer in Pentridge Prison: Tony is                          on remand for stealing a TV while David is being held                          accused of murdering Martin Healy. The two become close                          and when both are eventually released, David invites Tony                          to live with him and Beryl. David arranges a job for Tony                          at The Terrace coffee shop.
Kevin Palmer makes it clear that he doesn't like Tony                          - and when Tony is left to look after Kevin and Lynn's                          baby son, Davey, and he catches pneumonia because he's                          left to lie in the rain, the tension between the two young                          men increases. Tony decides he's caused enough trouble                          for the Palmers, and runs away. David tracks him down                          back at his parents' and suggests they spend some time                          away from Melbourne. They end up at Woombai, where Tony                          meets some guys who invite him to join their rodeo. David                          expresses reservations, but Tony is enthusiastic and takes the job.
It's not long, though, before Tony receives a call from                          his mother, saying that she's left Tony's father, Joe                          - but he's hanging around outside her new apartment, hassling                          her. Tony decides to return to Melbourne and moves in                          with his mother, to look after her. From there, events                          escalate when Joe accuses Alice of having an affair with                          David Palmer. Tony comes up with a plan to get his father                          off his mother's back: he agrees to carry out a robbery                          with Joe, but arranges for the police to turn up and arrest                          him. Joe is put in jail. Meanwhile, Tony and Alice move                          up to Woombai, where they feel safe from Joe's clutches.
Unfortunately, Joe escapes from jail and tracks Tony                          and Alice, together with David and Beryl, down to Woombai.                          He uses a gun to hold them hostage - but when Terry Hansen                          causes a distraction, Alice grabs the weapon and fires                          four shots at Joe. Joe dies as a result of his injuries.                          Alice is released on bail for the killing.
While staying at Woombai, waiting for Alice's case to                          be heard, Tony meets 17-year-old Shelley Barton. They                          become close, but after the Barton family home is destroyed                          in a bush fire, Mr. Barton decides to move the family                          to the city. Shelley turns up again in Sydney, where Alice's                          trial is being held. She meets up with some other kids                          at The Cross, and ends up moving into a squat to live                          with them, much to Tony's horror.
Alice is cleared of murdering Joe Parker, and she lands                          a job in Lorne. Tony decides to move there with her, Shirley                          and Dennis, meaning the whole family is together again.                          Apart from a brief disruption when Jeff O'Brien asks Tony                          to hide him while on the run from home, Tony enjoys a                          happy new life with his mother, brother and sister.
