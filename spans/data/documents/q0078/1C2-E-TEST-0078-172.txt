Guest - Who is the best german player on that team?
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Coming into the game I would have said Malik Muller. He won the International MVP at the 2010 Jordan Brand Classic and looked very good in that tournament. Tonight he's 0-6 and has just one point despite leading Germany in minutes played.

Paige Fan - Marcus Paige generally excels at running a team and getting his teammates easy shots.  How has he done in those areas so far?
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: USA Midwest hasn't run enough half court sets for Paige to really shine in that area specifically. They have just six assists on 22 field goals and Paige has no assists at halftime. He hasn't been bad by any means, just hasn't had that many opportunities.
Guest - do the german team have hight at all
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: They have three guys 6-8+, but USA Midwest is just gigantic. Jarnell Stokes, for instance, is just 6-9 but he's 240+ and as strong a body inside as you'll find.
Guest - Did Mitch McGary travel to the event, or did he stay home since his ankle won't let him play anyways?
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: He's not here tonight. I would assume you are correct that he chose to stay home.
Guest - mike do you have a idea of play time for each player
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: On the USA Midwest side they are just running even splits. Each five man unit plays five minutes of each quarter.
Paige Fan - So the Midwest is basically just owning the paint and getting all the rebounds, and Germany hasn't been able to force them to run much halfcourt offense?
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: You nailed it, Paige Fan. Germany is also shooting just 13.2% in the first half and USA  Midwest ran on a lot of long misses.

Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Tony Parker scores inside on a putback. USA Midwest picking up right where they left off in the first half.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Thomas Rueter with a bucket inside for Germany. He got Stokes in the air and then finished inside.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: USA Midwest not playing with the same defensive urgency to open this half. Their coach is imporing them not to settle for jump shots and to get shots at the rim.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Thomas Reuter gets his third basket of the half. This time he draws a foul on Daniel Ochefu in the process. USA Midwest second unit in there now with Rozier, Harris, Tokoto, Poythress and Ochefu.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Maximilian Kleber at the line for Germany. He makes one of two.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Ochefu with a bucket inside and then a rebound that starts the break, but USA Midwest can't get a bucket. On the next possesson Ochefu gets a block which leads to a fast break lay up for Garry Harris.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: And after his excellent sequence Ochefu has to come out of the game with a pronounced limp. He seems to be ok, but need a quick breather. Tony Parker replaces him on the floor.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Tony Parker with a put back slam on the break after Alex Poythress swatted a Kenneth Ogbe shot attempt to start the break.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Maximilian Kleber hits a three and Germany has 19 third quarter points. They had 16 in the entire first half.
Guest - How many rebounds does Tony Parker have at this point in the game tonight?

Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Guaranteed its hard to focus when you're up 35.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Tony Parker has 14 points and 10 rebounds (7 off) in 17 minutes.  Or as a recent comment put it.....

Guest - How has Marcus Paige looked.. Smooooooth????
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: He's a ball player. I'd like to see him later this weekend to get a better feel for his all around game. He certainly has excelled in this high-paced blowout.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Archie Goodwin gets a dunk on the break. USA Midwest playing solid D here in the fourth. They've switched to a zone and its bothering the Germans, who are shooting just 8.3% from three.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: Jarnell Stokes doing it all. He gets a big block, runs the break and finds Marcus Paige in the corner for a jumper. Tony Parker was standing next to me during that sequence and said "He strong, ain't he?" Yes, Tony, Jarnell is very strong.
 
Mike Richman, OregonLive.com: USA Midwest 96, Germany 50 - 2:29, 4th Q
