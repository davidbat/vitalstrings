Yesterday it was announced that Eva Longoria and Tony Parker are splitting due to infidelity on Tony’s side, and today we’re finding out how Eva learned of Tony’s affair. Emails and texts, of course. The way they used to do it back in the 1800s.
A source spoke to RadarOnline and explained what Tony did and how Eva caught him:
“Tony had Erin’s personal information stored in an electronic program that only he could access. It was a double shot for her because not only did she find all the information but Eva also realized immediately that Tony had taken steps to hide it from her. The fact that Tony had been hiding Erin’s information and their correspondence made Eva feel like he had been lying to her for months, and basically he had been. They have a long-distance marriage and that alone is not easy. There was already a lot of stress between them. But then when Eva discovered Tony had taken elaborate measures to lie to he she knew it was over.”
Dude, that’s so so so sad for Eva Longoria. No joke. And so so so telling about the state of human relationships. I feel like every single time I hear of people breaking up these days, it has something to do with someone’s email being read or some girl in Florida that someone met on Tumblr. My married friends are flirting on Twitter, my homegirls are breaking into their fuck buddy’s email accounts. As if cheating hasn’t always been a problem, we now have a handful of new ways to engage in it and get caught doing it.
Have you ever caught someone cheating on you via email or text or have you been caught yourself? What was the #1 thing you took from the experience?
