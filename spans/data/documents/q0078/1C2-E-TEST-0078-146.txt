Eva Longoria is certainly having a rough week. Amid the media firestorm surrounding her divorce from husband Tony Parker — who allegedly had relations behind Eva's back with NBA teammate Brent Barry's wife, Erin Barry — the annual ALMA Awards which she hosts, have been canceled.
The cancellation of the ALMAs — an award show which honors Latinos in the entertainment industry — has been in consideration for months, according to E! News , and the situation does not relate to Eva's current marital disaster.

This explains why the nominations were never announced in August.
"Unfortunately, we're not doing the [ALMAs] this year," Delia de la Vara, one of the show's producers, told Latina.com .
"We heard there was interest from other broadcasters to carry the ALMA Awards and we started to pursue that."
While this year may be lost, 2011 promises a resurgence of the award show.
"We're working toward a 2011 Fall broadcast of the show during Hispanic Heritage Month," de la Vara added.
