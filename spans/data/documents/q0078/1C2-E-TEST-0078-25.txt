Early this month we told you that Tony Parker had a new lady friend ( Tony Parker’s New Paris Lady..She is No Eva Longoria ).
Now there is a name to the face, Barbara Morel.  She can’t drink yet, but that didn’t stop Tony Parker. Age and wives of teammates are irrelevant to him.
Our friends at Larry Brown Sports has more details.
According to their information, Morel is a 19-year-old girl who won Miss  Nationale in France. She is also a trade and commerce student in  Saint-Lambesc, Bouches du Rhône. The youth of Morel should be a nice  change from Parker’s previous wife, Eva Longoria.
She is sort of blah to me, but I like curves on my ladies.  Pimp on Tony, Pimp on.
