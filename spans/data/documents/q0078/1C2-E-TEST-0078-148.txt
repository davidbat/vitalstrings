Eva Longoria: 'It's Been Hard'
Eva Longoria opens up about her painful divorce from San Antonio Spurs player Tony Parker in the new issue of Allure. How does she feel about it now?
The first few months of 2011 have been a challenge for Eva Longoria : First, she found out about Tony Parker's affair with a teammate's wife via text message. Then, she faced intense media scrutiny when she filed for divorce.
Now, things are looking up for the Desperate Housewives hottie -- she's reportedly dating the sexy younger bro of actress Penelope Cruz , Eduardo. She's opening up about the divorce in the April issue of Allure -- and the plain is obviously still fresh.
"Every time I talk about it, I want to cry. It's been hard. Very hard," Longoria , 36, told the magazine.
"I'm just trying to get through it as gracefully as possible without any drama," she continued. "I'm kind of having to find new patterns because I'm not used to having -- I'm used to always being on a plane and flying to a basketball game."
Longoria met Parker after she divorced her first husband, actor Tyler Christopher. The couple married in 2007 in a super posh French chateau.
"I'm in a transition stage, settling into a new routine, and I welcome it," Longoria told Allure.
And you so deserve it, Eva! The best revenge against a cheating jerk is dating a younger, hotter man -- and she's got that covered with the 25-year-old Eduardo Cruz. Have you seen pictures of him? Definitely a steamy piece of man there.
Do you think Eva Longoria is better off without the cheating Tony Parker ...Eduardo Cruz is definitely an upgrade!
