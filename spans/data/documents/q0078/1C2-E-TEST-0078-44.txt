The Spurs have talked to teams in the lottery, including the Toronto Raptors and Sacramento Kings , who hold the fifth and seventh picks, respectively. The Kings are determined to get a frontline point guard, and have also talked with the Denver Nuggets about Raymond Felton (notes) .
It’s unclear who the Spurs would prefer to take if they acquired a high lottery pick.
If the Spurs were to trade Parker, George Hill (notes) could become their starting point guard. League sources said Hill also has drawn trade interest from teams willing to give the Spurs a pick near the back end of the lottery.
Parker didn’t play well early in the Spurs’ first-round loss to the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies in May then later told French reporters he thought the franchise’s days of contending for a title had all but ended.
