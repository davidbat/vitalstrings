One of the quickest players in the NBA... A fast break waiting to happen... Breaks down defenses with his amazing speed... Very good driving to the basket... Gets tons of layups... Very effective finger-roll layup... Can create off the dribble... Nice shot, but not from the three-point line... Must improve decision-making a little bit... Bad from the foul line... One of the elite guards in the NBA.
