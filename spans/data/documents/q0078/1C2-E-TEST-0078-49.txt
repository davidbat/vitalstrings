Eva Longoria has been single since last November, but she still cries when she thinks about her split from basketball player Tony Parker.
"It's been -- every time I talk about it, I want to cry. It's been hard. Very hard. I'm just trying to get through it as gracefully as possible without any drama," Longoria says in the April issue of Allure .
Longoria filed for divorce from San Antonio Spurs star Parker last November after three years of marriage, citing "irreconcilable differences." Their break had followed months of speculation that Parker cheated on her.
Longoria allegedly found hundreds of text messages on Parker's phone from Erin Barry, the wife of Parker's former San Antonio Spurs teammate Brent Barry. Parker denied any physical relationship with Erin Barry and filed his own divorce papers in November
But the split has Longoria lookng for new routines. "I'm kind of having to find new patterns because I'm not used to having -- I'm used to always being on a plane and flying to a basketball game."
With her marriage over, Longoria is also getting a little help from her lady friends.
"You know, some people collect plates and stamps and coins. I collect people, I collect amazing, smart, interesting women," the desperate ex-housewife tells the mag.
"Two actors who I lean on heavily for life advice are Marcia Cross and Felicity [Huffman]. We're like sisters," Longoria says.
She may be a big star now, but back in the day she was earning minimum wage flipping burgers in a Wendy's.
"I still remember the order to put things on the burger: Mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, onions, tomato, lettuce, mustard. Would you like some fries with that?" Longoria says.
For the cover shoot, makeup artist Stephane Marais had a definite concept in mind. "I wanted to make her look incredibly sexy, like Sophia Loren," said makeup artist Stephane Marais, who focused on her eyes. "She's a lashes freak -- the more I added, the happier she was," he says.
More from the interview:
On her next phase in life: "I'm in a transition stage, settling into a new routine, and I welcome it."
On the legacy of 'Desperate Housewives': "'Desperate Housewives' was groundbreaking for Latinos in television because the Solises were the richest people on the block -- and they're Mexican."
On being racy in past interviews: "It's hard for me to censor myself, because I like to be honest and free and say exactly what I'm thinking of feeling. Unfortunately, so many things are taken out of context, and [now] I'm a little more cautious about what I say."
