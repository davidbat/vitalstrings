The Gossip Wire was atwitter this Hump Day as Eva Longoria-Parker filed for divorce from husband Tony Parker, ending the couple’s three year marriage after a humiliating cheating scandal.
Now we’re getting our first look at the woman who helped tear the couple apart.
According to an Access Hollywood source, The Other Woman/aka Mistress/aka Sideline Ho is allegedly Erin Barry, the wife of former NBA player Brent Barry — who just happens to be one of Tony’s ex-teammates. The guys hooped together on the San Antonio Spurs between 2004 – 2008.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Brent — who now works as a sports analyst for NBA TV — filed for divorce from Erin on Oct. 29. Coinkydink? We think not. When entertainment journalist Billy Bush quizzed Barry on the nature of her relationship with Parker this afternoon, the leggy blonde burst into tears and replied “No Comment.”
The Desperate Housewives star filed divorce papers in Los Angeles Superior Court today – a day after her publicist denied reports that Tony had filed for divorce in Texas. Us Magazine reports that the split came after Eva, 35, discovered Tony, 28, was having an affair with Barry — a mutual friend of the couple — who he was allegedly texting “hundreds of times a month for almost a year.” Tony also reportedly cheated on Eva with yet another woman just a few years ago. He kept in touch with that lass via Facebook.
Eva was “heartbroken by the betrayal” upon learning of her husband’s most recent indiscretion, an insider tells Us.
The actress began dating the French-born Parker in Jan. 2005. They announced their engagement in Nov. 2006 and married a year later in a lavish wedding ceremony in a castle on the outskirts of Paris.
