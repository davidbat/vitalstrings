Tony Parker is going from housewife to beauty queen.
The San Antonio Spurs guard is reportedly dating 20-year-old Barbara Morel, the winner of France's 2010 Miss Nationale pageant. Parker divorced his wife, "Desperate Housewives" star Eva Longoria, in November after a three-year marriage.
Morel was the winner of the inaugural Miss Nationale pageant last December. The competition was created to challenge the more-established Miss France pageant, a French equivalent of Miss America.
Parker told a French newspaper last month that he thought the Spurs' title chances were over. He later backed off those comments when they created a firestorm in America. Before last week's draft, Parker was the subject of trade rumors but remains with the team that drafted him in 2001. The 29-year-old begins a new four-year, $50 million contract this season.
He and Longoria met in 2004 and were engaged two years later. She filed for divorce late last year after reportedly discovering hundreds of text messages he had sent to the wife of a Spurs teammate.
In addition to her pageant career, Morel studies trade and commerce in Saint-Lambesc, Bouches du Rhône.
