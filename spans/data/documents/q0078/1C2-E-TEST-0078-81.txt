Tony Parker Has a Top 3

Reiterating comments Tony Parker made last month, his AAU coach, Norm Parker, said the big man’s top three schools are Duke, Ohio State and Memphis.
“I think those three are his top schools,” Norm Parker said Saturday by phone from Orlando. “He’s probably taken unofficials to all those schools and I think he would probably go back on his officials. I gotta believe that he will make a decision from there.”
“Right now I’m still open but those schools are recruiting me the hardest,” Tony Parker said last month.
At that point, Parker said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski compared him to a couple of Duke greats.
“He was just telling me how I would fit in, how I would play in their system if I came to Duke,” Parker said. “A lot of stuff was fairly true. He showed me tapes of Carlos Boozer and Elton Brand.“
Norm Parker also compared Tony to Glen “Big Baby” Davis, but said the 6-foot-8, 280-pound big man must work hard to stay in shape and avoid getting too big.
“He’s like most big men,” Norm said. “He’s gotta always work hard to stay in shape and stay at the top of his game.
“He’s so talented. He has some of the best footwork I’ve ever seen. I compared him to Elton Brand and “Big Baby.”  He’s got super hands, great footwork and when he plays hard he’s as good as any big man in the country.”
Parker and the Georgia Stars will appear on ESPNU Tuesday night against Texas Pro featuring Danuel House and Danrad “Chicken” Knowles in the Super Showcase from Orlando (7 p.m.). The Super Showcase championship will be televised Wednesday night.
