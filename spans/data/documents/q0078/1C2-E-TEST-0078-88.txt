Tony Parker is seeking refuge on the basketball court as he copes with his recent divorce from actress Eva Longoria . In his first interview since the split, Parker says he's trying to "make sense of things."
"The most important thing is to stay strong mentally, even if these are very difficult times," Parker told France's Le Parisien newspaper (via PEOPLE ). "I've take refuge in basketball because that's what I've done best since my youth."
With the support of his teammates and family, Parker is trying to move on. "My whole family has been around me through this," he said, adding he's trying to avoid reading anything written about his marriage.
Longoria filed for divorce from Parker in November, citing irreconcilable differences as a reason for the split.
There has been speculation that Parker cheated on his wife. Longoria allegedly found hundreds of text messages on Parker's phone from Erin Barry, the wife of Parker's former San Antonio Spurs teammate Brent Barry. Parker has denied any physical relationship with Erin Barry and filed his own divorce papers .
Longoria took to her Twitter account to make an official announcement about the split. "It is with great sadness that after 7 years together, Tony and I have decided to divorce. We love each other deeply and pray for each other's happiness," she wrote.
The split seemed to surprise everyone -- even their close friends. 'Basketball Wives' star Tami Roman, a longtime friend of Longoria's, thought the couple were destined to be together forever. "Eva genuinely loved him and thought they'd be together forever. I'm sure she never imagined anything like this would happen," Roman told PopEater in December.
But this isn't the first time an infidelity scandal has plagued the pair. In 2007, a number of tabloids reported that Parker had cheated on Longoria with model Alexandra Paressant. The couple denied the claims and were eventually issued an apology from X17Online, which claimed to have been misled by Paressant.

Longoria and Parker married three years ago. The actress announced her engagement to the San Antonio Spurs point guard in November 2006, and the couple wed in Parker's native France the following year.
Now, Parker is trying to stay focused on the basketball court and move on from the heartbreak. "You have to know how to keep things in perspective," he told Le Parisien. "I am, first of all, a basketball player. I've done this for so very long ... For me, it's been essential to be successful on the court."
