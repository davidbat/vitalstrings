We know that Eva Longoria has moved on since her break up with Tony Parker to Eduardo Cruz (the two were most recently spotted checking in for a flight to Miami), now it looks as if Tony has also found a new boo to keep him occupied. (at least while he’s in France enjoying the French Open and what not with Bradley Cooper)
Tony was spotted out with this mystery lady in France, no details about her have emerged yet but I’m sure a snitch or press release will come out soon enough with all the dirty details. :giggle: for now, check out the pictures.
