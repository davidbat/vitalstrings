With his deer-in-the-headlights visage          and Bambi-like frame, he looks more like a guy who can’t get in          a pick-up game at the local schoolyard than the point guard of an NBA          champion. But Tony is as fearless and competitive a player as you’re          likely to find—and he’s barely of legal drinking age! This          is his story…
Growing Up
William Tony Parker Jr. was          born on May 17, 1982, in Bruges, Belgium. He lived most of his early life          on the move as the son of a basketball vagabond. His father played professionally          for 15 years in Europe, spending the bulk of his career in France. Among          the cities the Parkers called home were Gravelines, Denain, Fécamp          and Rouen.
Tony Sr. learned the game on          the streets of Chicago. A talented shooting guard, he starred at Loyola          University in the mid 70s, then headed across the Atlantic to pursue his          pro hoops dreams. His first stop was Amsterdam, where he met Pamela
 
 
Firestone,          an aspiring fashion model. The two eventually married, and after the arrival          of Tony, they welcomed two other sons, Terrence and Pierre.
Tony's father wasn't the only          source of his basketball genes. His uncle on his mother's side was Jean-Pierre          Staelens, a legendary figure in French hoops. He was instrumental in launching          Tony Sr.’s European career.
Tony was two years old when          he picked up a basketball for the first time. Initially, he found soccer          more intriguing. Strong, quick and coordinated, he was a superb scorer,          and believed he was destined for stardom on the pitch.
That began to change in the          spring of 1991, after Tony's ninth birthday, when his athletic skills          began to translate to the hardwood. Each summer the Parkers returned to          Chicago to visit with Tony’s grandparents. In June of ’91,          the Bulls were putting the finishing touches on their first NBA title.          Tony was in awe of Michael Jordan, and left the States with a new goal:          to play in the NBA.
From the first time Tony saw          Jordan, he idolized the high-flying superstar. But given his stature,          he identified more with players like Isiah Thomas and Gary Payton, lightning-quick          point guards who could both distribute the ball and score. Over the next          few

summers,          Tony spent his Chicago visits polishing his game and working on his English—French          was the language spoken in the Parker home once they returned to the continent.
Delighted by his son's decision          to focus on basketball, Tony Sr. taught his son everything he knew about          the sport. The youngster's first taste of organized hoops came with a          club in Fécamp, and his passion for the game increased. Beginning          in 1994, he spent two years with Deville-les-Rouen, then a season with          Mont Saint-Aignanin. In 1997, Tony’s name began to circulate in          European basketball circles when he was named MVP of the Salbris Junior          Tournament.
At the age of 15, Tony collected his first paycheck as a pro. Recruited          by coach Lucien Legrand, he enrolled at the National Institute of Physical          Education (INSEP), and joined Centre Federal, a team in France's Nationale          2 league. With Tony running the show, the team went 16-14, its best season          ever. But he didn't feel challenged by the level of competition he faced,          and the following year jumped to INSEP's team in Nationale 1. Against          players older and stronger, Tony thrived, leading the league in scoring          and steals. When opponents tried to intimidate him, he weathered the physical          punishment, then burned them with his speed.
Tony's eye-opening performance with Centre Federal made him a hot commodity in France's more accomplished          professional leagues. Upon finishing his studies at INSEP, he signed with          Paris Saint-Germain Racing (which later changed its name to Paris Basket          Racing) of the Pro A circuit. The experience taught him a lot about being          a team player. For the first time in his career, Tony wasn't the focal          point of his squad. In fact, he didn't even start. The backup to Laurent          Sciarra, an ironman point guard, Tony worked hard in practice and observed          his overstudy closely from his seat on the bench. By the end of the year,          despite a lack of playing time, he had improved drastically.
More confident and polished,          Tony joined France's national junior team for the European Championships.          The 18-year-old guided the French to the title, and earned MVP honors          along the way. He also helped Paris Basket Racing to a second-place finish          in the Coupe de France.
On the Rise
In the summer of 2000, with          his reputation growing, Tony was invited to the Nike Hoop Summit in Indianapolis.          There, before a coterie of pro scouts and college coaches, he put on a          show, stealing the spotlight from other prepsters like Darius Miles, Zach          Randolph and Omar Cook. In the marquee contest between American and European          all-stars, he rang up 20 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two          steals.
Tony's stunning U.S. debut          launched a recruiting war between a handful of college powerhouses. UCLA          and Georgia Tech appeared to have the inside track until Tony did an about-face.          When Sciarra left PBR, he decided to remain in France to take over as          the team's starting point guard. Tony blossomed in his new role, averaging          14.7 points and 5.6 assists. Though stocked with young, inexperienced          talent, PBR snuck into the playoffs before being eliminated in the first          round. Tony did not regret his decision to forego the bright lights of          the NCAA for one instant.

European          Championships. Behind their scintillating 19-year-old, the French finished          first in their division. Named MVP of the tournament, Tony topped everyone          in scoring (25.8 ppg), assists (6.8 apg) and steals (6.8 spg).
As the 2001 NBA draft approached          in June, interest in Tony steadily increased. While some talent evaluators          clung to the belief that Europe couldn't produce a competent point guard,          others like R.C. Buford were blown away by Tony's all-around game. San          Antonio's assistant GM, Buford had attended the 2000 Nike Hoop Summit,          and gave a tape of the 6-1 point guard to coach and GM Gregg Popovich.          Highly skeptical before viewing the video, Popovich became convinced him          that Tony was worth the gamble.
The Spurs had been building          through trades and signings in recent years, and had not made much headway          in the draft. Their goal all year was to find a perimeter player they          could develop, but the 2001 crop was very thin. With the last pick in          the draft, the organization was hoping that Tony would go unnoticed. In          the pre-draft buzz and predictions, Tony’s name was barely mentioned.          The Spurs kept their fingers crossed until their selection, then announced          his name.
Tony was elated. Wasting no          time, he signed and flew to Colorado to play for the Spurs in the Rocky          Mountain Revue, a summer league for NBA hopefuls. In four games, he averaged          18 points, nine assists, four rebounds and two steals. Just as impressive          was the way he adjusted to his new surroundings, on and off the court.          Tony wasn't the least bit bothered by the pace of play or size of his          opponents. He also blended easily into American culture. The Spurs began          to wonder whether they had lucked into a potential superstar.
Going into training camp, Tony was slotted as the back-up to

Antonio          Daniels, a fourth-year player whom San Antonio hoped would come into his          own at point guard. His backcourt mate was veteran Steve Smith, who was          replacing Derek Anderson. Also new to the roster was forward Bruce Bowen,          a defensive specialist with a decent outside jumper. Of course, the Spurs          were built around Tim Duncan and David Robinson, the league's most formidable          one-two punch in the paint. Riding the pine alongside Tony were veterans          Terry Porter, Malik Rose, Danny Ferry and Stephen Jackson.
Four games into the 2001-02          campaign, San Antonio looked ragged. After a blowout loss in Sacramento,          Popovich shook up the team, and inserted Tony into the starting lineup.          His impact was immediate. Tony pushed the tempo, and got the Spurs better          shots by catching opponents in transition. He could also hit open jumpers,          which created more space for the big men. Tony still had much to learn          about running an NBA offense, but he always had (and usually took) the          option of running plays through Duncan and Robinson. They in turn seemed          re-energized by the rookie’s presence on the floor.
With Tony in charge, the team          ripped off seven victories in a row, and re-established itself as one          of the best in the West. Less than a week after taking over for Daniels,          Tony recorded a season-high of 22 points in a win at Charlotte. In December,          he guided the Spurs to a mark of 11-3. After his first month in the league,          he was averaging double-digits and nearly five assists a game.
As the season moved on, Tony's          teammates continued to respond with him at the helm. Duncan benefitted          from the rookie's surprising leadership as much as anyone. With more touches,          his scoring and assist totals climbed, and he ended up winning the MVP.
Tony earned his fair share of post-season honors. Named to the

All-Rookie          First Team, he ranked in the Top 10 among NBA newcomers in nearly every          significant statistical category, including scoring (8th at 9.2 points),          assists (2nd at 4.3), steals (7th at 1.2), three-pointers (5th at 61)          and minutes (5th at 29.4).
That's not to say Tony was          immune to some of the typical rookie pitfalls. A sprained ankle landed          him on the injured list for 10 days in January. When he returned to action,          he hit the proverbial wall, and struggled to find his running legs. After          being selected to play in the the Rookie Challenge, Tony picked up his          play and regained his stamina in the second half. In March, he logged          45 minutes in a two-point victory over the Houston Rockets, posting 16          points and 10 rebounds. Three weeks later he beat the Sonics in Seattle          with a jumper late in the fourth quarter.
Tony’s defining moment          as a rookie came against Utah. The Spurs and Jazz were locked in a battle          for first place in the Midwest, and their final meeting would decide the          division title. With the game tied and just a few seconds left, Tony took          the ball the length of the court and dropped in a layup for an 86-84 victory.
At 58-24, San Antonio entered          the post-season with high hopes. Tony knew there was a big difference          between the kind of basketball played in the playoffs and what he had          experienced in the regular season. He was hardly surprised when the Spurs’ first-round opponent, the Supersonics, gave them all they could handle.          Tony was looking forward to going up against Gary Payton, his boyhood          hero, and torched him for 21 points (including three three-pointers) in          the opener. The best-of-five series went the distance, with the Spurs          prevailing despite an injury to Robinson. Tony finished with a 17.2 scoring          average on 50 percent shooting.
An even sterner test          came next, against the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers.          The underdog Spurs surprised L.A. at home by splitting the first two games,          but Shaq and Kobe took over and the Spurs dropped the next three to end          their season. Tony’s best performance came in a losing cause, when          he lit up the Lakers for 20 in the first half of Game Three.
Making His Mark
Although he had a way to go          as a playmaker, Tony had erased

any          doubts about his ability to play in the NBA with his solid playoff debut.          He spent the summer adding to his offensive repertoire, perfecting the          follow-through on his jumper and developing a “tear-drop” floater he could launch when penetrating into the lane.
The Spurs also spent the off-season          fine-tuning. Kevin Willis, Steve Kerr, Speedy Claxton and Emanuel Ginobili          were all brought in to strengthen the bench. Though Smith was handed the          starter's job at shooting guard, many believed his aging knees wouldn't          hold up over the long haul, so Popovich readied Jackson for more minutes.          Robinson's health was a bit of a question mark as well, which meant Rose's          role would grow. The only certainty was Duncan, who again would be counted          on to do the heavy lifting at both ends of the court.
San Antonio got off to a roaring          start with an opneing-night victory over the Lakers in Los Angeles. Tony          struggled in the win, missing all 10 of his shots from the field, but          bounced back to assume a more active scoring role. In December, he recorded          a pair of 32-point games to establish a new personal scoring mark. In          just his second season, in fact, the player who flew under everyone else’s          radar in 2001 was fast becoming the Spurs’ second option on offense.
The respect accorded Tony by          enemy defenses had a ripple effect across the entire team. With the second-year          point guard as a kick-out option, Duncan had even more room to maneuver,          putting him on the way to another MVP season. Popovich, meanwhile, was          able to play the defensive-minded Jackson more, and could sub Rose for          Robinson to keep his veteran center fresh. With freelance specialist Ginobili          also logging big minutes off the bench, the team was coming together beautifully.
As the calendar turned to          2003, San Antonio truly hit its stride. In January and February, the club          lost a total of just four games. The Spurs wound up with a record of 60-22,          and homecourt advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs. Tony          ended the campaign averaging 15.5 points and 5.3 assists. While he was          shooting more, he was also hitting on a higher percentage of his attempts          and going to the line more often. His increased production was a welcome          reprieve for Duncan, who didn't have to carry the team by himself all          the time. With the big guy feeling strong, the Spurs saw a chance to do          some real damage in the playoffs.
The post-season provided its          usual challenges, first in the form of the Phoenix Suns, who nearly toppled          the Spurs. Tony had more than he could handle in Stephon Marbury, and          San Antonio barely escaped with a 3-2 series win.
Next up were the big, bad Lakers.          The Spurs took the first two games at home, despite lackluster play on          Tony’s part. When the series moved to L.A., Tony failed to pick          up his game, and the Lakers knotted the best-of-seven series at 2-2. Finally,          in Game Five, Tony cut loose. Shooting with confidence, he helped the          Spurs build a big third-quarter lead, then held on with the rest of his          teammates as a furious Laker rally fell short. Tony had another superb          outing in Game Six, teaming with Duncan to score 64 and spark a second-half          wipeout of the defending champs, who saw their title run end at three.
The Spurs squared off against          the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, a series that offered          a compelling contrast in styles. San Antonio, perhaps the league's top          defensive team, favored a deliberate pace of play, while the Mavericks          preferred to race up and down the floor. Dallas surprised the Spurs in          Game One with a 113-110 victory, connecting on a record 49 of 50 free          throws. Game Two saw San Antonio even things up in convincing fashion.          Tony was one of the four Spurs to score in double figures.
San Antonio appeared to gain          the upper hand when the series

moved          to Dallas. Tony and Duncan were unstoppable in Game Three, scoring 29          and 34, respectively, in a 96-83 win. But the bigger story was the knee          injury suffered by Dirk Nowitzki. With the All-Star on the sidelines in          Game Four, the Spurs won by seven points. Against a smaller lineup assembled          by Dallas coach Don Nelson, Tony had an excellent night with 25 points          and five assists.
Two days later the Spurs let          the Mavericks back into the series. After building a big lead in the first          half, they watched as the undermanned Mavs rallied for an improbable 103-91          victory, behind a stellar performance by veteran Michael Finley. Tony          shouldered some of the blame, shooting just three of 11 from the field          and failing to put the clamps on opposing point men Steve Nash and Nick          Van Exel. San Antonio gave the Mavs a dose of their own medicine in Game          Six, however, erasing a fat third-quarter deficit. With Tony struggling          again, Popovich found an unlikely hero in Steve Kerr, who nailed four          three-pointers down the stretch to put the contest on ice. The Spurs were          in the finals.
San Antonio was a decided favorite          over the New Jersey Nets, mostly because of Duncan. Still, the Spurs did          not figure the Nets would be pushovers. The team had won 10 straight post-season          contests, and playmaker Jason Kidd could control the tempo of games like          no other guard.
The Kidd-Parker match-up actually          provided the series’ most interesting subtext. The veteran at the          peak of his skills versus the hot, young newcomer was only part of it—Kidd          would be a free agent after the season, and the Spurs had the salary-cap          space to sign him. If that happened, Parker might be shifted to two-guard,          or he would bring a king’s ransom on the trading block. Kidd, meanwhile,          had never played on a team with a dominant big man, so a San Antonio signing          was something more than idle chatter.
What no one expected was that          Tony would outperform Kidd. But that’s just what happened in the          opener, as he used his quick first step to blow past the New Jersey All-Star          time and again in a convincing 101-89 win. Tony had 16 points and five          assists.
Kidd picked up the gauntlet          in Game Two. Although Tony topped the Spurs with 21 points, Kidd scored          30, including several great shots in the fourth quarter. Poor foul shooting          by Duncan also cost the Spurs, as the Nets evened matters with an 87-85          victory. Afterwards, Kidd cracked that the only thing Tony did better          than him was speak French.

again          Kidd responded. Two nights later he held Tony to just three points in          an ugly 77-76 win. To his frustration, Tony found himself on the bench          when San Antonio challenged late in the game, as Claxton led the charge.          Tony gained some redemption in Game Five—he played well and the          Spurs rode a fabulous effort by Duncan to a 3-2 series lead.
When the          series shifted back to San Antonio, the Nets took a big second-half lead          in Game Six. With Tony missing his shots, and New Jersey clogging the          passing lanes, Popvich sensed panic seting in and again turned to Claxton.          The Spurs went on an amazing 19-0 run to win the NBA championship. Though          disappointed in his own performance, Tony was on Cloud Nine. The taste          of his first title was even sweeter than he ever imagined.
For Tony, the 2003 playoffs          may have posed more questions than they answered. He had his good games          and his bad ones, but when the day was done he was the second-youngest          point guard to ever lead his team to a championship. Though not a classic          one-guard, he obviously has a lot of room to grow. Will he evolve into          a shooting guard, or will he ease into the role of floor general? Perhaps          he will eventually fill both roles, continuing the lineage of Lenny Wilkens,          Nate Archibald, Isiah Thomas and Gary Payton.
Tony the Player
Tony has terrific court vision,          and runs the break well. But he is as much a scorer as he is a passer.          That being said, he knows how to distribute the ball and get everyone          involved in the offense. As the point guard on a team with the league’s          best
Tim Duncan & David Robinson,
 
 
all-around          player, Tony’s job is to feed him the ball. Would he develop faster          elsewhere? Might he be overwhelmed by responsibility on a different club?
Ask 10 NBA scouts and you’ll          likely get 10 different answers. What they will all agree on is that despite          Tony’s seemingly fragile frame, he is truly fearless. Also, he doesn’t          shy away from taking big shots. Those qualities spell “leader” in the NBA.
Quickness is probably Tony’s          greatest asset, particularly when he has the ball in hands. His first          step to the hoop is devastating. Opponents know this, and normally back          off when Tony dribbles on the perimeter, which gives him plenty of room          to fire his jumper. A good shooter to begin with, he continues to increase          his range and accuracy.
