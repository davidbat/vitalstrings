W.i.P. nightclub feels Tony Parker's lawsuit against them is baseless and that there is no way they could have predicted the melee that went down.
NBA star Parker filed a $20 million lawsuit this week, claiming the club is responsible for the Chris Brown-Drake fight in which he was injured.
Parker sustained a scratched retina from shards of glass flying after Brown, Drake, Meek Mill and threw down, requiring eye surgery as a result.
Tony says it's obvious "there was bad blood between Drake and Brown" (allegedly over Rihanna ) and that W.i.P. staff should have known better.
Moreover, he says they fueled matters by selling their posses alcohol.
But sources close to the club, which has been shuttered, say Drake and Chris Brown are not prone to violence ... at least not toward other dudes.
The club feels the fight was out of its control , and as for the alleged bad blood, a source said, "Chris Brown and Drake are not Biggie and Tupac."
Parker also suggested that the club was way understaffed, which W.i.P. refutes, saying that 15 security guards were working the night in question.
So far, no charges have been filed related to the brawl, though the club was closed indefinitely and the case is still under investigation by the NYPD.
