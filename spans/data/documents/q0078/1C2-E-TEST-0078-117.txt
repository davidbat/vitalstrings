Parker divorced ex-wife and Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria back in November.
Morel won the first-ever Miss Nationale pageant in December at the age of 19.  The competition was established to compete with the more-established Miss France pageant.
Before last week’s NBA draft, it was thought that Tony Parker, 29, might be traded, but he is still with the Spurs, who drafted him back in 2001. He starts a new, four-year, $50 million contract this season.
He and Longoria met in 2004 and got engaged two years later. She filed for divorce late in 2010 after supposedly finding hundreds of text messages he had sent to the wife of one of his teammates.
