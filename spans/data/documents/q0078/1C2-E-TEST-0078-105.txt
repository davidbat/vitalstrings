Joseph O'Leary and Reuters | June 22, 2012
NEW YORK (Reuters) - San Antonio Spurs point guard Tony Parker is seeking up to $20 million in damages from a New York City nightclub for injuries he says he sustained when a fight erupted between friends of singers Chris Brown and Drake.       Parker contends that nightclub W.i.P. is responsible for a "corneal laceration of the left eye and other injuries" he suffered during the June 14 bottle-throwing melee since it failed to take proper security precautions, according to a lawsuit filed by the basketball star on Thursday.

The Sports Xchange       NBA: Spurs' Parker files $20 million lawsuit       NBA       San Antonio Spurs guard Tony Parker has filed a $20 million lawsuit against a New York City night club after suffering a scratched cornea during a fight there last week.       The incident involved singer Chris Brown and members of the entourage of hip-hop star Drake. It's unclear how Parker was involved in the fight, but that is not stopping him from going forward with the suit against the W. I. P. club in New York's SoHo district and its owners/operators, citing negligence in security and supervision that allowed the fight to occur, Parker's suit alleges.

France's big shooter
By Bonnie DeSimone, Tribune staff reporter. Tribune staff reporter K.C. Johnson contributed | June 25, 2003
If Mickael Pietrus, as expected, is selected early in Thursday's NBA draft--perhaps by the Bulls with the seventh pick--there is one huge difference he will notice between that league and the Pro A, where he plays in France.      A bigger difference than the larger players and the more physical play. Bigger than the vast basketball palaces and the multimillion-dollar deals.      That one thing is . . . air conditioning.      This town outside Lyon has sweltered for the last two weeks under humid, 90-degree temperatures, the worst heat wave in 50 years.

Derrick Rose faces big challenge right away
BY K.C. JOHNSON | October 29, 2009
If it seems like there have been 27 days of Derrick Rose ankle updates, it's because that's true.      Thursday, Rose finally will take the court for the first time since injuring the posterior tibialis tendon in his right ankle Oct. 2 in Indiana.      "I can't wait," Rose said. "I'm about 80 percent. Hopefully by the end of the month, I should be back to my regular self. My explosiveness isn't all the way there."      Tony Parker's is. Rose knows what that means for his defensive assignment against the Spurs.

I like American sports. For me, it would be a dream to be able to see an American football game and NBA game every week.      San Antonio Spurs (1). Because of Tony, obviously.      Yeah, I tried to play Tony. He played me. He's one of the best in the league. As you can imagine, I wasn't that great against him.      It was a bit difficult because I'm friends with Tony and friends with Ronny Turiaf (2). I had to text them both "good luck" before the game.      I'm a Giants fan. So you can imagine I was happy when they won against the Patriots.

Thunder knock out Spurs to reach NBA finals

OKLAHOMA CITY -- They came ready to roar, to conduct an earsplitting warmup for their first foray into the NBA Finals.       Instead, Thunder fans could only sit in stunned silence for most of the first half.       The Spurs, thought to be a franchise on its last, aging legs after dropping three consecutive games in the Western Conference finals, showed plenty of pluck in taking an 18-point lead.       But then came the noise, building and building until Chesapeake Energy Arena shook as if its rafters might cave in.
