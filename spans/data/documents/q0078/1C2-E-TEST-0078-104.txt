With his deer-in-the-headlights visage and Bambi-like frame, he looks more like a guy who can’t get in a pick-up game at the local schoolyard than the point guard of an NBA champion. But Tony is as fearless and competitive a player and  person as you’re likely to find. He’s got the rings and MVP award—plus the Hollywood starlet wife—to prove it.   This is his story
GROWING          UP
William Tony Parker           Jr. was born on May 17, 1982 in Bruges, Belgium. ( Click          here for a complete listing of today's sports birthdays .) He lived most of           his early life         on the move as the son of a basketball vagabond. His father played professionally           for 15 years in Europe, spending the bulk of his career in France.           Among         the cities the Parkers called home were Gravelines, Denain, Fécamp         and Rouen.
Tony Sr. learned the          game on the streets of Chicago. A talented shooting guard, he starred          at Loyola University in the mid '70s, then headed across the Atlantic to          pursue his pro hoops dreams. His first stop was Amsterdam, where he met          Pamela Firestone, an aspiring fashion model. The two eventually married,          and after the arrival of Tony, they welcomed two other sons, Terrence          and Pierre.
Tony's father wasn't           the only source of his basketball genes. His uncle on his mother's           side was Jean-Pierre         Staelens, a legendary figure in French hoops. He was instrumental in       launching Tony Sr.’s European career.
Tony was two years old when          he picked up a basketball for the first time. Initially, he found soccer          more intriguing. Strong, quick and coordinated, he was a superb scorer          and believed he was destined for stardom on the pitch.
That began to change         in the spring of 1991, after Tony's ninth birthday, when his athletic         skills         began to translate to the hardwood. Each summer the Parkers returned         to Chicago to visit with Tony’s grandparents. In June of ’91,         the Bulls were putting the finishing touches on their first NBA title.         Tony was in awe of Michael Jordan and left the States with a new goal:         to play in the NBA.
From the first time          Tony saw Jordan, he idolized the high-flying superstar. But given his          stature, he identified more with players like Isiah Thomas and Gary Payton,          lightning-quick point guards who could both distribute the ball and score.          Over the next few summers, Tony spent his Chicago visits polishing his          game and working on his English—French was the language spoken in          the Parker home once they returned to the continent.
 
 
Delighted           by his son's decision to focus on basketball, Tony Sr. taught Tony           everything           he knew about         the sport. The youngster's first taste of organized hoops came with a           club in Fécamp, and his passion for the game increased. Starting          in 1994, he spent two years with Deville-les-Rouen, then a season with          Mont Saint-Aignanin. In 1997, Tony’s name began to circulate in         European basketball circles when he was named MVP of the Salbris Junior         Tournament.
At the age of 15, Tony collected his first paycheck as a pro. Recruited          by coach Lucien Legrand, he enrolled at the National Institute of Physical          Education (INSEP) and joined Centre Federal, a team in France's Nationale          2 league. With Tony running the show, the squad went 16-14, its best season          ever. But Tony didn't feel challenged by the level of competition,          and the following year he jumped to INSEP's team in Nationale 1. Against          players older and stronger, Tony thrived, leading the league in scoring          and steals. When opponents tried to intimidate him, he weathered the physical        punishment, then burned them with his speed.
Tony's eye-opening performance    with Centre Federal made him a hot commodity in France's more accomplished    professional leagues. Upon finishing his studies at INSEP, he signed with    Paris Saint-Germain Racing (which later changed its name to Paris Basket    Racing) of the Pro A circuit. The experience taught him a lot about being    a team player. For the first time in his career, Tony wasn't the focal    point of his squad. In fact, he didn't even start. The backup to Laurent    Sciarra, an ironman point guard, Tony worked hard in practice and observed    his overstudy closely from his seat on the bench. By the end of the year,    despite a lack of playing time, he had improved drastically.
More confident and polished,    Tony joined France's national junior team for the European Championships.    The 18-year-old guided the French to the title, earning MVP honors    along the way. He also helped Paris Basket Racing to a second-place finish    in the Coupe de France.
ON   THE RISE
In the summer of 2000, with    his reputation growing, Tony was invited to the Nike Hoop Summit in Indianapolis.    There, before a coterie of pro scouts and college coaches, he put on a    show, stealing the spotlight from other prepsters like Darius Miles, Zach    Randolph and Omar Cook. In the marquee contest between American and European    all-stars, he rang up 20 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two    steals.
Tony's stunning U.S. debut    launched a recruiting war between a handful of college powerhouses. UCLA    and Georgia Tech appeared to have the inside track until Tony did an about-face.    When Sciarra left PBR, he decided to remain in France to take over as    the team's starting point guard. Tony blossomed in his new role, averaging    14.7 points and 5.6 assists. Though stocked with young, inexperienced    talent, PBR snuck into the playoffs before being eliminated in the first    round. Tony did not regret his decision to forego the bright lights of    the NCAA for one instant.

Tony           next led France's 20-and-under squad into the 2001 European          Championships. Behind their scintillating 19-year-old, the French finished          first in their division. Named MVP of the tournament, Tony topped everyone          in scoring (25.8 ppg), assists (6.8 apg) and steals (6.8 spg).
As the '01 NBA draft approached          in June, interest in Tony steadily increased. While some talent evaluators          clung to the belief that Europe couldn't produce a competent point guard,          others like R.C. Buford were blown away by Tony's all-around game. San          Antonio's assistant GM, Buford had attended the 2000 Nike Hoop Summit          and gave a tape of the 6-1 point guard to coach and GM Gregg Popovich.          Highly skeptical before viewing the video, Popovich became convinced that Tony was worth the gamble.
The Spurs, who had been         building through trades and signings in recent years, had not made         much headway         in the draft. Their goal was to find a perimeter player they         could develop, but the 2001 crop was very thin. With the last pick         in         the draft, the organization was hoping that Tony would go unnoticed.         To the team's delight, his name was barely         mentioned in the pre-draft buzz and predictions. The Spurs kept their fingers crossed until their selection,         then announced         his name.
Tony was elated to be selected by San Antonio. Wasting no          time, he signed and flew to Colorado to play for the Spurs in the Rocky          Mountain Revue, a summer league for NBA hopefuls. In four games, he averaged          18 points, nine assists, four rebounds and two steals. Just as impressive          was the way he adjusted to his new surroundings, on and off the court.          Tony wasn't the least bit bothered by the pace of play or size of his          opponents. He also blended easily into American culture. The Spurs began          to wonder whether they had lucked into a potential superstar.
Going           into training camp, Tony was slotted as the back-up to Antonio          Daniels, a fourth-year player who the Spurs hoped would come into his          own at point guard. His backcourt mate was veteran Steve Smith, who was          replacing Derek Anderson. Also new to the roster was forward Bruce Bowen,          a defensive specialist with a decent outside jumper. Of course, the Spurs          were built around Tim Duncan and David Robinson, the league's most formidable          one-two punch in the paint. Riding the pine alongside Tony were veterans        Terry Porter, Malik Rose, Danny Ferry and Stephen Jackson.
Four games into the         2001-02 campaign, San Antonio looked ragged. After a blowout loss in         Sacramento,         Popovich shook up the team and inserted Tony into the starting lineup.         His impact was immediate. Tony pushed the tempo, getting the Spurs         better         shots by catching opponents in transition. He could also hit open jumpers,         which created more space for the big men. Tony still had much to learn         about running an NBA offense, but he always had (and usually took)         the         option of running plays through Duncan and Robinson. Both seemed         re-energized by the rookie’s presence on the floor.
With Tony in charge, the team          ripped off seven victories in a row and re-established itself as one          of the best in the West. Less than a week after taking over for Daniels,          Tony recorded a season-high of 22 points in a win at Charlotte. In December,          he guided the Spurs to a mark of 11-3. After his first month in the league,          he was averaging double-digits and nearly five assists a game.
Tony Parker, 2002 Fleer
 
As the season moved          on, Tony's teammates continued to respond with him at the helm. Duncan          benefitted from the rookie's surprising leadership as much as anyone.          With more touches, his scoring and assist totals climbed, and he ended          up winning the MVP.
Tony           earned his fair share of post-season honors, too. Named to the All-Rookie            First Team, he ranked in the Top 10 among NBA newcomers in nearly           every  significant statistical category, including scoring (8th at 9.2 points),          assists (2nd at 4.3), steals (7th at 1.2), three-pointers (5th at 61)  and minutes (5th at 29.4).
That's not to say Tony was          immune to some of the typical rookie pitfalls. A sprained ankle landed          him on the injured list for 10 days in January. When he returned to action,          he hit the proverbial wall and struggled to find his running legs. After          being selected to play in the the Rookie Challenge, Tony picked up his          play and regained his stamina in the second half. In March, he logged          45 minutes in a two-point victory over the Houston Rockets, posting 16          points and 10 rebounds. Three weeks later he beat the Sonics in Seattle          with a jumper late in the fourth quarter.
Tony’s defining         moment as a rookie came against Utah. The Spurs and Jazz were locked         in a battle         for first place in the Midwest, and their final meeting would decide         the division title. With the game tied and just a few seconds left,         Tony took         the ball the length of the court and dropped in a layup for an 86-84         victory.
At 58-24, San Antonio         entered the post-season with high hopes. Tony knew there was a big         difference         between the kind of basketball played in the playoffs and what he had         experienced in the regular season. He was hardly surprised when the         Spurs’ first-round opponent, the Supersonics, gave them all they         could handle. Tony was looking forward to going up against Gary Payton,         one of his boyhood         heroes, and torched him for 21 points (including three three-pointers)         in the opener. The best-of-five series went the distance, with the         Spurs         prevailing despite an injury to Robinson. Tony finished with a 17.2 scoring         average on 50 percent shooting.
An even sterner test         came next, against the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers.         The underdog Spurs surprised L.A. at home by splitting the first two         games,         but Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant took over and the Spurs dropped the next three to end         their season. Tony’s best performance came in a losing cause,         when he lit up the Lakers for 20 in the first half of Game 3.
MAKING          HIS MARK
Tim Duncan, 2001 Heritage
 
Although           he had a way to go as a playmaker, Tony had erased any           doubts about his ability to play in the NBA with his solid playoff           debut.         He spent the summer adding to his offensive repertoire, perfecting the           follow-through on his jumper and developing a “tear-drop” floater           he could launch when penetrating into the lane.
The Spurs also spent the off-season          fine-tuning. Kevin Willis, Steve Kerr, Speedy Claxton and Emanuel Ginobili          were all brought in to strengthen the bench. Though Smith was handed the          starter's job at shooting guard, many believed his aging knees wouldn't          hold up over the long haul, so Popovich readied Jackson for more minutes.          Robinson's health was a bit of a question mark as well, which meant Rose's          role would grow. The only certainty was Duncan, who again would be counted          on to do the heavy lifting at both ends of the court.
San Antonio got off         to a roaring start with an opneing-night victory over the Lakers in         Los Angeles. Tony         struggled in the win, missing all 10 of his shots from the field, but         bounced back to assume a more active scoring role. In December, he         recorded         a pair of 32-point games to establish a new personal scoring mark. In         just his second season, the player who flew under everyone         else’s          radar in 2001 was fast becoming the Spurs’ second option on offense.
The respect accorded Tony by          enemy defenses had a ripple effect across the entire team. With the second-year          point guard as a kick-out option, Duncan had even more room to maneuver,          putting him on the way to another MVP season. Popovich, meanwhile, was          able to play the defensive-minded Jackson more and could sub Rose for          Robinson to keep his veteran center fresh. With freelance specialist Ginobili          also logging big minutes off the bench, the team was coming together beautifully.
As the calendar turned to          2003, San Antonio truly hit its stride. In January and February, the club          lost a total of just four games. The Spurs wound up with a record of 60-22,          good for homecourt advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs. Tony          ended the campaign averaging 15.5 points and 5.3 assists. While he was          shooting more, he was also hitting on a higher percentage of his attempts          and going to the line more often. His increased production was a welcome          reprieve for Duncan, who didn't have to carry the team by himself all          the time. With the big guy feeling strong, the Spurs saw a chance to do          some real damage in the playoffs.
The post-season provided its usual challenges, first in the form of the Phoenix Suns, who nearly toppled          the Spurs. Tony had more than he could handle in Stephon Marbury, and          San Antonio barely escaped with a five-game series win.
Next up were the         big bad Lakers. The Spurs took the first two games at home, despite         lackluster play on         Tony’s part. When the series moved to L.A., he failed to pick         up his game, and the Lakers knotted the best-of-seven series.         Finally,         in Game 5, Tony cut loose. Shooting with confidence, he helped the         Spurs build a large third-quarter lead, then held on with the rest of his         teammates as a furious Laker rally fell short. Tony had another superb         outing in Game 6, teaming with Duncan to score 64 and spark a second-half         wipeout of the defending champs, who saw their title run end at three in a row.
The Spurs squared          off against the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, a series          that offered a compelling contrast in styles. San Antonio, perhaps the          league's top defensive team, favored a deliberate pace of play, while          the Mavericks preferred to race up and down the floor. Dallas surprised          the Spurs in Game 1 with a 113-110 victory, connecting on a record 49          of 50 free throws. Game 2 saw San Antonio even things up in convincing          fashion. Tony was one of the four Spurs to score in double figures.

San           Antonio appeared to gain the upper hand when the series moved          to Dallas. Tony and Duncan were unstoppable in Game 3, scoring 29          and 34, respectively, in a 96-83 win. But the bigger story was the knee          injury suffered by Dirk Nowitzki. With the All-Star on the sidelines in          Game 4, the Spurs won by seven points. Against a smaller lineup assembled          by Dallas coach Don Nelson, Tony had an excellent night with 25 points          and five assists.
Two days later the Spurs let          the Mavericks back into the series. After building a big lead in the first          half, they watched as the undermanned Mavs rallied for an improbable 103-91          victory behind a stellar performance by veteran Michael Finley. Tony          shouldered some of the blame, shooting just three of 11 from the field          and failing to put the clamps on opposing point men Steve Nash and Nick          Van Exel. San Antonio gave Dallas a dose of its own medicine in Game          6, however, erasing a fat third-quarter deficit. With Tony struggling          again, Popovich found an unlikely hero in Kerr, who nailed four          three-pointers down the stretch to put the contest on ice. The Spurs were          in the NBA Finals.
San Antonio was a decided favorite          over the New Jersey Nets, mostly because of Duncan. Still, the Spurs did          not figure the Nets would be pushovers. The team had won 10 straight post-season          contests, and playmaker Jason Kidd could control the tempo of games like          no other guard.
The Kidd-Parker match-up         actually provided the series’ most interesting subtext: the veteran at the          peak of his skills versus the hot, young newcomer. That, however, was only part of it—Kidd          would be a free agent after the season, and the Spurs had the salary-cap          space to sign him. If that happened, Parker might be shifted to two-guard,          or he would bring a king’s ransom on the trading block. Kidd, meanwhile,         had never played on a team with a dominant big man, so a San Antonio         signing         was something more than idle chatter.
What no one expected         was that Tony would outperform Kidd, which is exactly what happened         in the opene. Tony used his quick first step to blow past the New         Jersey All-Star         time and again in a convincing 101-89 win. He finished with 16 points and five         assists.
Kidd picked up the gauntlet          in Game 2. Although Tony topped the Spurs with 21 points, Kidd scored          30, including several important shots in the fourth quarter. Poor foul shooting          by Duncan also cost the Spurs, as the Nets evened matters with an 87-85          victory. Afterwards, Kidd cracked that the only thing Tony did better          than him was speak French.
Tony           scored 26 in Game 3 to key an 84-79 win by the Spurs, but again           Kidd responded. Two nights later he held Tony to just three points           in         an ugly 77-76 victory. To his frustration, Tony found himself on the bench           when San Antonio challenged late in the game, as Popovich turned to Claxton to lead the charge.           Tony gained some redemption in Game 5 —he played well and the       Spurs rode a fabulous effort by Duncan to go up by a game.

With the series         back in San Antonio, the Nets took a big second-half lead in Game 6.          When Tony began missing his shots and New Jersey clogged the passing lanes,          Popvich sensed panic setting in and again turned to Claxton. The Spurs          went on an amazing 19-0 run to win the NBA championship. Though disappointed          in his own performance, Tony was on Cloud Nine. The taste of his first          title was even sweeter than he ever imagined.
For Tony, the 2003          playoffs posed as many questions as they answered. He had his good games          and his bad ones, but when the day was done he was the second-youngest          point guard ever to guide his team to a championship. Though not a classic          one-guard, he obviously had a lot of room to grow.
Starting the 2003-04          season, the Spurs felt they could repeat. Granted, only six players remained          from the previous year, but the additions of Robert Horry, Charlie Ward,          Ron Mercer, Jason Hart, Hedo Turkoglu and Rasho Nesterovic gave the club          plenty of depth.
Tony started the year          on the sidelines, missing the first seven games due to a sprained left ankle.          Once he returned, the Spurs began to roll. They entered December at 9-9,          but ended the month at 22-10.
San Antonio resumed          its fine play in January. Tony had big games in victories at Minnesota          and L.A., going for nearly 30 in both. The young point guard showed the          ability time and again to play up to his competition. He finished the          regular season at 14.7 ppg and 5.5 apg. 
The Spurs carried          an 11-game post-season winning streak into the playoffs. The three seed          in the West, they faced off against Memphis in the first round and bounced          the Grizzlies with a four-game sweep. Tony picked it up to the tune          of 21 points a night.
Next up were the Lakers          in a series that many thought would decide the NBA champion. The Spurs          seized control early, taking the first two games on their home floor.          Tony bombarded L.A. with 20 points in the first one. His inside-outside          game opened things up for Duncan, who dropped in 30. Tony was even better          in Game 2, netting 30 himself.
When the series shifted          to the Staples Center, the Lakers changed their defensive scheme. Shaq          hunkered down in the paint, and the rest of Lakers shut down the perimeter.          The effect on Tony was tangible, particularly when he started matching          up against Bryant. L.A. won the next two..
The series dagger          came in Game 5, with the Spurs up 73-72 after a miracle shot by Duncan.          Unfortunately for San Antonio, Derek Fisher outdid him with an impossible twisting jumper with 0.4          seconds left on the clock. Back in Los Angeles, the Lakers sent the demoralized          Spurs packing with an 88-76 victory. Tony's shooting stat line told the          story. He connected on 21 of his first 32 attempts, but only 22 of his          last 71.
Tony shook off the          disappointment of San Antonio's playoff loss to L.A. by enjoying his finest          year as a pro in 2004-05. He shot better from the field, played a more          opportunistic brand of defense and increased his scoring (16.6 ppg), rebounding          (3.7 rpg) and passing (6.1 apg). More aggressive and more confident, Tony          developed into the all-around leader the Spurs had been banking on. He          was at his best over the campaign's final three months, after Popovich fiddled          with the lineup and made Ginobili the team's sixth man. The move gave          Tony a bit more freedom and responsibility, and he thrived in his enhanced          role.
Tony's value to San          Antonio was most evident during the post-season. After posting a 59-23          record, good for the second seed in the West, the Spurs entered the playoffs          among the favorites to capture the NBA crown. Thanks to several off-season          acquisitions, incuding the addition of Brent Barry, and a mid-season deal          that brought over Nazr Mohammed, the team featured one of the league's          most balanced rosters. The only question was Duncan, who was recovering          from a sprained ankle. If he was 100%, or close to it, the Spurs figured          to advance to the NBA Finals without too much trouble.
Their first-round          matchup against the Nuggets went as planned. San Antonio took Denver in          five games, with Tony going for 29 points and seven assists in the clincher.          Next the Spurs disposed of the pesky Sonics, ending the series in Game          6 on the road. Tony was solid again, averaging nearly 18 points a contest          and using his playoff experience to help unnerve Seattle point guard Luke          Ridnour.
In the Western Conference Finals, San Antonio beat the run-and-gun          Suns at their own game. Popovich let Tony and Ginobili force the tempo          at their discretion, and the two responded with big efforts. Tony poured          in 29 points in Game 1 and 24 in Game 2, as the Spurs won twice in Phoenix.          Though San Antonio dropped Game 4 at home, the club was never really challenged,          closing out the Suns two days later.
In the NBA Finals against          the Pistons, Tony was often the X-factor that Detroit had no answer for.          Duncan was the focal point of the offense, but it was San Antonio's perimeter          attack that gave him the operating room he needed. The series went the          distance, with the Spurs claiming their third title with a workmanlike          victory in Game 7. While Tony's numbers against the Pistons didn't jump          off the stat page, his poise under Detroit's constant defensive pressure          and his ability to pump in key baskets didn't go unnoticed by his teammates.

It also didn't go unnoticed by actress Eva Longoria. The two had begun dating in 2004, and their relationship blossomed from there. Eva could be found courtside at every meaningful Spurs game. Tony often accompanied her on the red carpet for Hollywood events. The couple quickly became one of the world's most glamorous.
Tony, in turn, took the court in 2005–06 looking better than ever. It showed in his numbers, as he lifted his scoring average to 18.9—eclipsing Duncan as the Spurs’ top scorer—and shot 54.8 percent from the field, putting him head and shoulders above all NBA guards in this category. He also played in his first All-Star Game.
The addition of Michael Finley gave San Antonio another scoring option, which took some pressure off the sore-footed Duncan and translated into four extra wins. The Spurs edged the improving Mavericks by three games in the Southwest Division.
It was a different story in the playoffs, however. After disposing of the Sacramento Kings in six games, the Spurs faced the Mavs in an epic seven-game struggle. Duncan was magnificent, but Nowitzki and company prevailed. Tony averaged over 21 points in the playoffs, but Dallas was the better team when it counted, winning two games in overtime, including the finale.
Tony was selected for the All-Star Game for a second time in 2006–07 and continued to elevate his level of play. His decision-making with the ball was almost flawless, and his tear-drop jumper became one of the NBA’s signature scoring plays. At 20.8 points and 5.8 assists, he enjoyed perhaps his finest season as a pro. The Spurs fashioned an impressive 58-24 mark but finished behind the Mavericks in the division. After dropping their first playoff game to the Nuggets, they took four straight.
San Antonio's second-round meeting with the Suns became the focal point of the Western Conference playoffs, especially after the Golden State Warriors dropped the Mavericks in the first round. In Game 1 of the Phoenix series, Tony and Steve Nash went head-to-head—literally—as a bloody Nash had to take a seat at crunch time. The Spurs won the game and went on to claim a hard-fought series. In the Western Conference Finals, they beat the surprising Utah Jazz four games to one.
Prior to the NBA Finals against LeBron James and the Cavaliers, Tony told his father that he felt he could dominate the series. He was overwhelmikngly confident despite the fact that Cleveland had won both of their previous meetings that season.
The Cavs realized in Game 1 that they had no one who could guard Tony, and he torched them for 27 points in an 85–75 victory. Game 2 was a blowout, and again Tony was San Antonio's high scorer, with 30 points. Game 3 was an ugly, low-scoring affair, but the Spurs prevailed again, 75–72. Tony was his team's high scorer for a third time.
The Spurs polished off the Cavs in Game 4, fending off a second-half rally to win 83–82. Tony helped spearhead a 12–3 run that put the Spurs back in control. When the final buzzer sounded, there was little doubt about the series MVP. Tony, who netted 24 in the finale,  was the  no-brainer choice. He averaged 24 points on 57 percent shooting against Cleveland and proved the difference-maker as the Spurs swept to their fourth NBA title.
Tony celebrated another life-changing event in July of '07 when he and Eva tied the knot in a lavish ceremony at a 17th century castle in France. VIP guests Felicity Huffman, Teri Hatcher, Sheryl Crow, Jessica Alba, Ryan Seacrest and soccer star Thierry Henry were among those in attendance.
Now a high-profile husband and an NBA Finals MVP, Tony has come a long way since his childhood days in Europe. On the court (and maybe off of it), the greatest improvement          in Tony is consistency. There used to be two distinct sides to          him. One side was the star who could dominate offensively.          The other was a young player who still lacked experience. His evolution          seems to be headed toward the former. Comfortable in his role as an NBA star and cultural icon, he is continuing the proud lineage of dynamic point guards like Isiah Thomas and Gary Payton.
TONY THE PLAYER
Tony Parker, 2006 Pristine
 
Tony          has terrific court vision and runs the break well—though he is as much          a scorer as he is a passer. That being said, he knows how to distribute          the ball and get everyone involved in the offense. As the point guard          on a team with the league’s best all-around player, Tony’s          job is to feed Tim Duncan the ball. Would he have evolved faster elsewhere? Might        he be overwhelmed by responsibility on a different club?
Ask 10 NBA scouts         and you’ll          likely get 10 different answers. What they will all agree on is that despite          Tony’s seemingly fragile frame, he is truly fearless. Also, he doesn’t          shy away from taking big shots. Those qualities spell “leader” in         the NBA.
Quickness is probably         Tony’s          greatest asset, particularly when he has the ball in hands. His first         step to the hoop is devastating. Opponents know this, and normally         back         off when Tony dribbles on the perimeter, which gives him plenty of room         to fire his jumper. A good shooter to begin with, he continues to increase         his range and accuracy.
Tony has fully developed into one of the league’s quickest, smartest, most dangerous players. No guard is better in the paint than Tony, and few balance the individual and team game better.
