Relaxed LeBron James Has No Regrets About Missing Kobe Bryant In The Finals

OKLAHOMA CITY – Having been here twice before and leaving empty-handed, Heat star LeBron James knows better than to take any of this for granted.
That’s why he laughed when asked if he was disappointed that none of his trips to The Finals have included a dream matchup against Lakers star Kobe Bryant, the only other player of this era who stirs as much debate and commands as much attention as James does.
“LeBron and Kobe?” James said, shaking his head and then breaking into a smile. “I was disappointed that LeBron [versus] whoever it was didn’t happen. I didn’t give a damn if it was Kobe or not. Listen, I understand it’s LeBron and (Kevin) Durant — that’s you guys’ storylines. I’m in the Finals so it doesn’t matter. I don’t care who it’s against. It could be us against a college team or high school team.”
As many as have stated in the lead up to Game 1 of The Finals tonight, this is a different James than the youngster who showed up in 2007 with Cleveland and was swept by Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and the Spurs or the James who showed up with Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and the Heat last year and fell to Dirk Nowitzki and the Mavericks.
James seems more at ease with himself and with his surroundings this time around, carrying his reading selection (Jay-Z‘s Decoded) with him at shootaround.
Maybe it’s his past experiences or the realization that the third time, at least for him, comes with a clear understanding of not only what’s at stake but also what needs to be done to finally finish the job.
Or maybe it has more to do with a season-long easing of the pressure he faced last year, his first with the Heat and away from his family back in Northeast Ohio. James said having everyone under the same roof at home and being in a comfort zone this season has meant everything to him.
