Welcome to Tony Parker Ministries, Inc., TPMI, a non-profit organization that offers Ministry and Community Outreach services to those in need.
 
TPMI was  founded by Minister Tony Parker, a man that has been on a journey and come full circle with what it truly means to be obedient to the Will of God. Once at the top of his career, as a  Florida State Trooper of the Year, Minister Parker succumbed to temptation and was confined to  federal prison  for  17 years. Upon Minister Parker's release from prison, he became an unstoppable testament,  reaching out within his community, spreading the tough lessons learned, to save one child, one person, from a road of destruction.
 
TPMI's services include Youth, Prison and AIDS & Afflicted Ministries . Also, Minister Parker began the H.O.P.E. Institute , which is the non-profit Community Outreach service division of TPMI. It provides court ordered services, life skills,   and various counseling forums.
 
TPMI offers ministry and motivational materials, Contact Us for more detail.
 
Minister Parker is available to speak/attend your event, upon request, pending availability. Please complete the Booking Request form or Contact Us .
