San Antonio Spurs guard Tony Parker has rebounded nicely from his divorce with Eva Longoria. He’s moved on in style, with 19-year-old French beauty queen Barbara Morel.
Morel won Miss Nationale in France, and we have no idea what that is, but other than the hood rats at his pool party , Parker has always had good taste in women, so we’ll assume it’s something awesome.
According to Larry Brown Sports , Morel is also a trade and commerce student in Saint-Lambesc, Bouches du Rhône. She also lives with mom and dad!
She currently lives in Lambesc with mother Nathalie, Didier, her stepfather, and younger sister Carla. Morel will represent France at the beauty pageant Miss International in Chengdu, China, in November. She may participate in international competitions Miss Earth, Miss Model of the World or Miss Tourism International.  
Frankly, she’s a step up from Longoria in our book. Hope she likes pool parties in San Antonio.
