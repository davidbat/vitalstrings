The divorce between Eva Longoria and Tony Parker was in the works for at least a week before Eva filed, with Tony denying he had sex with a former teammate’s wife.
New details are emerging on the Tony Parker and Eva Longoria split.
Sources are saying that Tony did have a “sexting relationship” with Erin Barry but said they never had a physical relationship.
And contrary to what Eva’s reps have claimed, Tony was well aware they were going to divorce.
Tony planned to file in San Antonio but “Eva talked him out of it because she wanted to file in Los Angeles.”
A source said Eva wanted to time her divorce filing to coincide with the Us Weekly interview. The source stated, “She was into the whole PR thing. He wasn’t.”
But Eva’s PR team claim this is untrue and that, “Eva and Tony were still talking about working out the marriage up until the morning she filed.”
