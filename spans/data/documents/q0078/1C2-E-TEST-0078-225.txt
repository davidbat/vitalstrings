All may be well for Tony Parker's first-place Spurs, but the star guard is still struggling with his off-the-court woes.
In an interview with a French radio station, he said he'd been working toward moving on from his divorce from Eva Longoria, while acknowledging it wasn't always easy.
"[Divorce] was hard, but life goes on," he said, according to People.com. "Like anyone else, I've learned that life is full of experiences and you learn from your mistakes. And go on."
Parker and Longoria split after the "Desperate Housewives" star found hundreds of text messages between her hubby and Erin Barry, the wife of one of his teammates. At the time, Parker insisted he had never cheated on Longoria.
"No one's perfect," he told the French radio station. "It's never easy."
The duo's split became official on Jan. 28.
"Starting over is hard to do," Longoria tweeted on Wednesday. "But life goes on. I pray for strength, courage and wisdom on my new journey."
It seems that journey has already begun. Earlier this month, she was spotted spending time with Eduardo Cruz -- the brother of Penelope Cruz.
"Eva definitely seems to have moved on from her sad divorce drama," a source told People.com at the time.
