Looks aren’t everything, a lot of time the most beautiful women are the hardest ones to deal with.   Parker seems to like his ladies a little plain (you see Brent Barry’s Ex Wife right?)

The NBA stud and his special friend left Tony’s hotel this morning, and the mystery woman was wearing the same clothes as the previous night.
Tony is in Paris checking out the French Open and I am sure this is just one of his many Paris jumpoffs.
