Eva Longoria, Tony Parker Getting Divorce, Parker Caught Texting Spurs Wife?
By Larry Brown November 17, 2010 - Posted in Basketball , Gossip
Regardless of how happy and fulfilled Eva Longoria always seemed to be in her relationship with Tony Parker, who actually thought that their marriage was a good fit?  Longoria is a major publicity whore and busy carrying out her acting career.  Tony is an NBA player traveling all the time for games.  How could that possibly work?
Obviously things didn’t as Longoria filed for divorce in LA citing “irreconcilable differences.” You have to love it because the filing comes a day after a rep denied that Parker had filed for divorce in Texas. That was purely semantics, because if things were going well between the couple then the rep would have outright denied the claim and dismissed the entire notion as false.
The story was big enough for a reporter to ask Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich if the issue would bother Parker, and he responded saying he never has problems getting his players focused.  I put much more confidence in Popovich to maintain a locker room than Mike Brown, who reportedly had to deal with another similar situation.
More details came out from US Magazine saying Longoria found hundreds of texts from Tony to and from another woman. People Magazine reports Longoria told her buddy A.C. Slater that she found hundreds of texts from the wife of one of Parker’s San Antonio teammates. Additionally, she says he cheated early in their marriage and still kept in touch with the woman through facebook.
Yikes, the Spurs are rolling at 8-1, but you have to wonder if this report will hurt the locker room.  I say there’s a fair chance that happens.
