Would it be worth it when the Knicks biggest free agent next year is Tony Parker?
Knicks literally destroyed their roster to get Lebron and Bosh but he went to Miami.  They expect a Carmello-Chris Paul package.  However, if Carmello goes to the Nets which more than likely will happen at the beginning of the season then Paul will probably stay in New Orleans or go elsewhere and the Knicks will be sh1t.  They will have to give Tony Parker a max deal like they did for Stoudemire for him to go there.
The whole Melo to New York or not is probably the Knicks' and I guess the Nets' biggest storyline going into the new season. As a huge Knicks fan I am not really sweating it.  I know it is going to take some time and anything can happen in between. Melo holds all the cards here (not the Nuggets) and like LeBron during his decision people can only speculate where he wants to go. But boy the Nuggets would be getting the short end of the stick if they are forced to take the Knicks offer which is probably Eddy Curry, Gallinari/ Anthony Randolph and Turiaf/Azubuike.  But I do agree that getting just Amare and Tony Parker is kind of a let down but still an improvement for the Knicks.
