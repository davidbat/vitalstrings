Preseason Outlook
Parker sits last two: With just two games remaining, on Wednesday and Thursday, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich told the San Antonio Express-News on Wednesday that veterans Tony Parker , Manu Ginbobili and Tim Duncan will all miss the final two games of the regular season. Neither of the three is dealing with any sort of injuries, so Popovich is simply resting them until the playoffs.

Fantasy Analysis
Parker has rested some this season, however when he has been on the court, he has been tremendous. Fantasy owners still finishing out the season should keep him reserved for the final two games. However as soon as the post season begins, owners in all formats should get him in the lineup for postseason Fantasy leagues, as he remains a high-end option.

Done following along, LeBron's developing hard edge it takes to win
Is LeBron done? That is, done as a follower, a kid brother -- accommodating all, but satisfying none? Gregg Doyel says with The Decision and Year One in Miami behind him, LBJ appears finished with failure.
Tony Parker is a quandary in Fantasy Basketball. Seemingly capable of being one of the top point guards in Fantasy, he is sometimes limited by the scope of his role under coach Gregg Popovich. Case and point, he averaged a career best 22 points per game during the 2008-09 season when he was allowed to shoot the ball a career-high 17.5 times per game. He has averaged no more than 17 points per game over the last two seasons while being held to below 14 shots per game. So while the ceiling remains very high across the board for Parker (he can score and pass with the best guards in the NBA), he remains a notch below the top-tier guards and should be targeted as more of a luxurious No. 2 option once the Chris Pauls, Russell Westbrooks and Steve Nashes of the world are off the board. If Parker is the first guard you are looking to take in a draft, you have waited too long. In category leagues, look for him to help across the board, but he can hurt you in free-throw shooting and doesn't shoot very many threes.  (Updated 8/28/11)
