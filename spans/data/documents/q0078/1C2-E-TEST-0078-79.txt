Tony Parker: Gregg Popovich Has Mellowed Thanks to Age, Wine
By Larry Brown January 26, 2012 - Posted in Basketball
Gregg Popovich is widely regarded as one of the best coaches in the NBA. Many people consider him to be the best. He’s also changed over the years , according to Tony Parker.
“As he gets older and drinks more wine, he gets more patient,” the Spurs point guard said.
“I always tell the rookies they’re lucky,” Parker said. “Because it’s nothing like when I was a rookie. He’s so nice to them.”
According to the San Antonio Express-News, Parker had been waiting for an eruption from Popovich all season but he hadn’t seen one until Wednesday night. The Spurs came out of halftime playing poorly against the Hawks, so Pop did a mass substitution, benching many players. The overhaul resulted in an easy 105-83 win.
San Antonio is 12-7 on the season, so whatever coaching method Pop’s been using seems to have been working. Maybe it’s the wine, maybe it’s not. If it is the alcoholic grape juice, I just hope it’s not any ******* Merlot.
