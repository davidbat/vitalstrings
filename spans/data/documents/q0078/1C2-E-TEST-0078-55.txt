Yes Tony is wrong for what he did to his friend, but Athlete's are NOT supposed to be role model...on the bball court, yes, i want my kid to be like Tony Parker or Micheal Air Jordan, but in his daily life, I want my kids to be like me. Therefore I must set the example. If they have no fathers, than a grandpa, uncle, cousin or teacher

Eva may have sat on other guy's laps but at least she didn't sleep with them or cheat on her husband. So she's a little flirty everyone flirts with people even when they're in relationships. The difference between Tony and Eva is Eva didn't feel the need to cheat on her marriage with her bestfriend's wife. How low can you get I mean really! If he does that how the hell will he be able to be a good role model to maybe some fans he has. I'd be surprised if anyone was his fan.

Eva is no saint here, she had her flings too.  I have seen so many pics of her sitting on mien's laps, I wondered if Tony approved.  Of course this marriage would not last with both of them cheating.
