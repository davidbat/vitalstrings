Paris, September 26, 2011. One year after signing professional basketball player Tony Parker as global ambassador in the brand's flagship store on the Champs-Elysées, Tissot launched the Tissot Racing-Touch Tony Parker Limited Edition 2011 at the prestigious Par Coeur Gala in Paris.
 
Tissot was honoured to be the official sponsor of the gala, which was hosted by co-founder of the Par Coeur Association and captain of the French national basketball team, Tony Parker. The annual Par Coeur Gala, which took place in the fabulous city hall, raises money for the Par Coeur Association's charity partners. It is an inspirational evening, attended by high-profile guests and celebrities. This year, the Par Coeur Association is raising funds for CéKeDuBonheur, which works to improve the quality of life for children and adolescents in hospitals, Action Innocence, which aims to preserve the dignity and integrity of children on the internet and Make A Wish, for which Tony Parker is the ambassador.
 
Tony Parker, who led France into the EuroBasket 2011 final, was happy to receive his first limited edition watch, which is part of the Tissot tactile collection. The Tissot Racing-Touch Tony Parker Limited Edition 2011 stems from more than ten years of experience with touch technology, making this piece much more than just a watch. With its 11 touch-activated functions, including a compass and a tide calculator, this timepiece is an athlete's high-tech personal trainer, providing the utmost precision in order to follow Tony Parker's lead and keep striving for better performances.
 
This dynamic and stylish limited edition of 4,999 watches has an engraving of Tony Parker's signature on the case back and comes with a black rubber strap and a carbon dial.
