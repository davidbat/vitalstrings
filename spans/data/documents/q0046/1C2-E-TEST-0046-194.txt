J.J.                 Roberts
President of Liberia 1848-55; 1872-74
Joseph                 Jenkins Roberts (1809-1876) was born in Virginia, U.S.A. His                 parents were poor. He came to Liberia in 1829. Roberts soon                 became a prosperous trader and also engaged in politics. After                 the creation of the Commonwealth of Liberia, in 1838, he became                 Vice-Governor. In 1841 Governor Thomas Buchanan, a cousin of the                 President of the USA, James Buchanan, died and was succeeded by                 J.J. Roberts. It was the first time that the colony was not                 governed by a white agent of the American Colonization Society -                 its legal owner  -                 but by a colonist. Although Roberts was a colonist, "he was                 not really black; he was an octoroon and could have easily                 passed for a white man", as Aboyomi Karnga, one of                 Liberia’s best-known historians reported. 
When in 1847 the                 Independent Republic of Liberia was created, J.J.                 Roberts became its First President. He served several terms                 from 1848 till 1855. After the deposition of the country’s                 first ‘black’ president, E.J.Roye (in 1871) he was again elected and served another                 term. It is very likely that the ‘colour conflict’ which                 separated the leading mulattoes from the large majority of                 colonists of darker complexion had much to do with the animosity                 between Roberts and Roye .
