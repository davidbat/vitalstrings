National Woman's Party,      Picketing and Prison
Although both Carrie Chapman Catt, NAWSA  president, and Alice Paul shared the goal of universal suffrage, their political  strategies could not have been more different or incompatible. Where NAWSA  concentrated a majority of its effort upon state campaigns, Paul wanted to focus  all energy and funding upon a national amendment.  While NAWSA endorsed  President Wilson and looked to members of the Democratic Party as allies, Alice  Paul wanted to hold Wilson and his party responsible for women's continued  disenfranchisement (a tactic of British Suffragettes). In 1914, after initially  forming a semi-autonomous group called the Congressional Union, Paul and her  followers severed all ties to NAWSA and, in 1916, formed the National Woman's  Party (NWP). The NWP organized "Silent Sentinels" to stand outside the White  House holding banners inscribed with incendiary phrases directed toward  President Wilson.  The president initially treated the picketers with bemused  condescension, tipping his hat to them as he passed by; however, his attitude  changed when the United States entered World War I in 1917. Few believed that  suffragists would dare picket a wartime president, let alone use the war in  their written censures, calling him "Kaiser Wilson."  Many saw the suffragists'  wartime protests as unpatriotic, and the sentinels, including Alice Paul, were  attacked by angry mobs. The picketers began to be arrested on the trumped up  charge of "obstructing traffic," and were jailed when they refused to pay the  imposed fine. Despite the danger of bodily harm and imprisonment, the  suffragists continued their demonstrations for freedom unabated.
The arrested suffragists were sent to Occoquan  Workhouse, a prison in Virginia. Paul and her compatriots followed the English  suffragette model and demanded to be treated as political prisoners and staged  hunger strikes. Their demands were met with brutality as suffragists, including  frail, older women, were beaten, pushed and thrown into cold,  unsanitary, and  rat-infested cells.  Arrests continued and conditions at the prison  deteriorated.  For staging hunger strikes, Paul and several other suffragists  were forcibly fed in a tortuous method.  Prison officials removed Paul to a  sanitarium in hopes of getting her declared insane.  When news of the prison  conditions and hunger strikes became known, the press, some politicians, and the  public began demanding the women’s release; sympathy for the prisoners brought  many to support the cause of women's suffrage.  Upon her release from prison,  Paul hoped to ride this surge of goodwill into victory. 
The Nineteenth Amendment
In 1917, in response      to public outcry about the prison abuse of suffragists, President Wilson      reversed his position and announced his support for a suffrage amendment,      calling it a "war measure." In 1919, both the House and Senate passed the 19th Amendment and the battle for state ratification commenced. Three-fourths of      the states were needed to ratify the amendment. The battle for ratification      came down to the state of Tennessee in the summer of 1920; if a majority of      the state legislature voted for the amendment, it would become law.  The      deciding vote was cast twenty-four year-old Harry Burn, the youngest member      of the Tennessee assembly.  Originally intending to vote “no,” Burn changed      his vote after receiving a telegram from his mother asking him to support      women’s suffrage. On August 18, 1920, Tennessee ratified the 19th Amendment. Six days later, Secretary of State Colby certified the      ratification, and, with the stroke of his pen, American women gained the      right to vote after a seventy-two year battle.  August 26th is now      celebrated as Women's Equality Day in the United States.
Alice Paul                  toasting (with grape juice) the passage of the 19th Amendment.                  August 26, 1920
"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or      abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex."
-Equal Rights Amendment
The Equal Rights Amendment
While many      suffragists left public life and activism after the 19th Amendment was enacted, Alice Paul believed the true battle for equality had      yet to be won.  In 1923, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Seneca      Falls Convention, Paul announced that she would be working for a new      constitutional amendment, one she authored and called the "Lucretia Mott      Amendment."  This amendment called for absolute equality stating, "Men and      women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place      subject to its jurisdiction."  The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was      introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until it passed in 1972.  During the 1940s, both the Republicans and Democrats added the ERA to their      party platforms.  In 1943, the ERA was rewritten and dubbed the "Alice Paul      Amendment."  The new amendment read, "Equality of rights under the law shall      not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of      sex."
Alice Paul worked tirelessly for the Equal  Rights Amendment in the United States and for women's rights internationally.  Following the passage of the 19th Amendment, Paul earned three law degrees  (LL.B., LL.M. and D.C.L.).  She also traveled to South America and Europe during  the 20's through the 50's.  She began the World Woman's Party (WWP),  headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1938. The WWP worked closely with the  League of Nations for the inclusion of gender equality into the United Nations  Charter and the establishment of the United Nations Commission on the Status of  Women.  Alice Paul moved back to the United States in 1941 and became active in  American women’s issues.  She led a coalition that was successful in adding a  sexual discrimination clause to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  The  re-emergence of the women’s movement in the late sixties led to renewed interest  in the ERA; in 1972, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed the  amendment and it went to the states for ratification.  Congress placed a  deadline of seven years on the ratification process; the amendment needed 38  states to become law. Though the deadline was extended until 1982, the amendment  fell short of ratification by three states. Since 1982, the ERA has come before  every session of Congress and current efforts are underway to ratify the  amendment.  If Congress repeals the time limit of the original bill and three  states vote for ratification, the ERA could become law.  (For more information  on the Equal Rights Amendment, visit http://www.equalrightsamendment.org ).

"I never doubted that        equal rights was the right direction. Most reforms, most problems are        complicated. But to me there is nothing complicated about ordinary        equality."

Alice Paul      died on July 9, 1977, in Moorestown, New Jersey, just a few miles from her birthplace and family home of Paulsdale. Her life demonstrates that      one person can make a difference. Her legacy lives on, bearing witness to      the significance of her life and inspiring others who struggle for social      justice. The Alice Paul Institute was founded in 1985 and is dedicated to      creating a heritage and leadership development center at Paulsdale.      The Institute works to educate and encourage women and girls to take      leadership roles in their communities and to continue the long struggle for      women's equality.  In her name, the API works to fulfill its mission to      honor her legacy, preserve her home, and develop future leaders.
