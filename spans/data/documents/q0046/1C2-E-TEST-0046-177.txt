ARTICLES in addition      to, and Amendment of, the Constitution of the United States of America,      proposed by Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of the several      States, pursuant to the fifth Article of      the original Constitution
[Article]
11th Amendment [Proposed 1794; Ratified 1798]
The Judicial      power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in      law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by      Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.
Summary: Federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme        Court, have no jurisdiction over state or local courts, including any        legal matters regarding the state governments themselves.  This makes        state supreme courts the highest "law of the land".
[Article]
12th Amendment [Proposed 1803; Ratified 1804]
The Electors      shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and      Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the      same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person      voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as      Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for      as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President, and of the      number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and      transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed      to the President of the Senate;—The President of the Senate shall, in the      presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the      certificates and the votes shall then be counted;—The person having the      greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such      number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no      person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers      not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House      of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But      in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the      representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose      shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a      majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. And if the House      of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice      shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then      the Vice-President shall act as President, as in the case of the death or      other constitutional disability of the President.—The person having the      greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if      such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if      no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list,      the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall      consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the      whole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person constitutionally      ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of      Vice-President of the United States.

[Proposed 1810 as 13th Amendment]

Summary:  No U.S. Citizen is allowed to accept        or maintain a title of any sort from any other country.  Nor shall        the holder of a foreign title by allowed ownership of U.S. property to to        profit from U.S. property.
[Unratified Article]
[Proposed 1861 as 13th Amendment; Signed by President Lincoln;      Unratified]
Article      Thirteen. No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will      authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any      State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons      held to labor or service by the laws of said State.
Summary:  No amendment may be passed that        governs specific practices within the states that are considered legal by        that state but may be considered illegal outside of that state.  This        includes slavery.  In other words, this Amendment, if ratified, would        have prevented the ratification of our current 13th        Amendment which outlawed slavery.
[ Article]
13th Amendment [Proposed 1865; Ratified 1865]
Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a      punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall      exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

[ Article]
14th Amendment [Proposed 1866; Ratified Under Duress 1868]
Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States,      and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States      and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law      which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United      States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or      property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its      jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
Summary:  Every person born in the U.S. is a        U.S. citizen.   No state can deny rights to any citizen without        a legal hearing.  States must apply all laws to every person.
Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several      States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of      persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to      vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice      President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive      and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof,      is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one      years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged,      except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of      representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number      of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens      twenty-one years of age in such State.
Summary:  Government representation is based on        population, excluding Indian reservations that are exempt from state        jurisdiction.   Voting for President, Vice-President, U.S.        Congress, State Governor, State Judges, and State legislators is done by        male citizens age 21 or older, who have not committed treasonous acts.
Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in      Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office,      civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having      previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the      United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive      or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United      States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or      given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of      two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.
Summary:  Nobody who has committed a treasonous        act is allowed to hold a position as a federal government official,        military official, state official, or judge.  This can be repealed by        a Congressional vote of 2/3.
Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States,      authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and      bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be      questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay      any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against      the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave;      but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.
Summary:  All debts owed by and to the U.S. are        valid except for any claims for loss due to the outlawing of slavery.
Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate      legislation, the provisions of this article.
[Article]
15th Amendment [Proposed 1869; Ratified 1870]
Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall      not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of      race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
Summary:  The right to vote can't be denied        because of race or skin color.  Nor can the right be denied because        the individual was once a slave.
Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by      appropriate legislation.
[ Article]
16th Amendment [Proposed 1909; Questionably Ratified 1913]
The Congress      shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source      derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard      to any census or enumeration.
Summary:  Federal income tax is legal.
[Article]
17th Amendment [Proposed 1912; Ratified 1913]
The Senate      of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State,      elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have      one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite      for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.
Summary:  The U.S. Senate is composed of two        elected senators from each state for a term of six years.  In Senate        matters, each senator has exactly one vote.  Requirements for running        for U.S. Senate are the same as running for the legislature of the state.  Some people claim that the reference to "six years" implies that a senator        is allowed only a single six-year term, since a second six-year term could        be considered a total of twelve years.
When vacancies happen in the      representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such      State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That      the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make      temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as      the legislature may direct.
Summary:  Vacancies in the Senate are filled by        a state election.  Until the election occurs, the state legislature        may grant the governor the authority to appoint an interim senator.
This amendment shall not be so      construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it      becomes valid as part of the Constitution.
Summary:  This portion is very vague.  It        either means that senators already serving at the time of the ratification        of the amendment are not affected in any way, or that the senators already        serving are affected beginning at the ratification of the amendment.  The second explanation means that a senator who's been serving a        state-determined 12-year term will now only serve a 6-year term starting        with the date of the ratification of the amendment.
[ Article]
18th Amendment [Proposed 1917; Ratified 1919; Repealed 1933 with 21st Amendment ]

Section 2. The power of the several States is unimpaired by this      article except that the operation of State laws shall be suspended to the      extent necessary to give effect to legislation enacted by the Congress.
Summary:  Federal laws passed by Congress under        Section 1 supersede all state laws regarding employment of people under        18.
[ Article]

Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end      at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and      Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such      terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms      of their successors shall then begin.

Section 3. If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of      the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect      shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen before the      time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall      have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President      until a President shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law provide      for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect      shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the      manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall      act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified.
Summary:  If the President dies after elected        but before the beginning of the term, the Vice President will be the        President.  If no President is elected or if the elected president is        disqualified, then the Vice President will act as interim President until        the elected President is qualified or a new qualified President is        elected.  If both the President and Vice President are disqualified,        then Congress will appoint an interim President and determine how a new        President will be elected.   This interim President will act as        President until both a President and Vice President are qualified.
Section 4. The Congress may by law provide for the case of the      death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may      choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon      them, and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the      Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have      devolved upon them.

A number of electors of President      and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives      in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but      in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to      those appointed by the States, but they shall be considered, for the      purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors      appointed by a State; and they shall meet in the District and perform such      duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment .
Summary:  The independent district (Washington,        D.C.) will have a share of electors for President and Vice President        equivalent to that of a state of equal size, but not to exceed the        smallest state.  This body of electors will have the same        responsibilities and requirements as states' electors as outlined in the 12th Amendment .

[Article]
24th Amendment [Proposed 1962; Ratified 1964]
Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote in      any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors      for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in      Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State      by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.
Summary:  Outlaws the refusal to allow voting        rights for President, VP, President/VP electors, Senate, or House of        Representatives based on a failure to pay any type of tax, including a        poll tax.
History:  A poll tax was created in some        precincts and was required to vote.  The polling bodies claimed that        it was to cover poll costs.   But the poll taxes ultimately        blocked out poor voters, especially those of minority races.
Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by      appropriate legislation.
[Article]
25th Amendment [Proposed 1965; Ratified 1967]
Section 1. In case of the removal of the President from office or      of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.
Summary:  If a President is impeached, dies, or        resigns, the Vice President will be the new President.
Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice      President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take      office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.
Summary:  If the position of Vice President        becomes vacant, the new Vice President will be nominated by the President        and must be approved by a majority vote of the Senate and House of        Representatives.
Section 3. Whenever the President transmits to the President pro      tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his      written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of      his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the      contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President      as Acting President.
Summary:  If the President sends a signed        letter to Congress stating that he/she is unable to perform the duties of        the President, then the Vice President will assume the duties of the        President until the President sends a signed letter to Congress stating        that he/she is able to perform Presidential duties again.
Section 4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the      principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as      Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the      Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written      declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties      of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and      duties of the office as Acting President.
Summary:  If the Vice President, along with a        majority of executive department heads, sends a letter to the Senate and        House of Representatives stating that the President is unable to perform        presidential duties adequately, the Vice President will then assume all        presidential duties.
Thereafter, when the President      transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the      House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists,      he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice      President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive      department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit      within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker      of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President      is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon      Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for      that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days      after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in      session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble,      determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to      discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall      continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President      shall resume the powers and duties of his office.
Summary:  At that point, the President must        send a signed letter to the Senate and House of Representatives stating        that he/she is able to perform all presidential duties, and he/she will        immediately assume the duties again unless the Vice President, along with        a majority of executive department heads, sends a letter within four days        to the Senate and House of Representatives that the President is, in fact,        unable to perform presidential duties.  If this second letter is        received from the Vice President, Congress must decide by 2/3 vote the        fate of the presidency within twenty-one days.  If Congress has not        decided within twenty-one days, the Vice President will continue to act as        President.
