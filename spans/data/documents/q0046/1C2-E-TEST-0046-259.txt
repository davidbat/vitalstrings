Please ask questions prior to bidding, I sell used articles, and do my best to describe things accurately. I am not an expert in any particular field. Please utilize my photos to help you decide whether or not to bid. I am unable to accept returns. I am happy to combine shipping on multiple purchases, just let me know that you are interested in multiple items and I will hold off on invoicing you until you are done bidding. I work two jobs, and am anal about packing, especially breakables. Please be patient, as I try to get things out within the week I get paid. I will do my best to accommodate shipping requests, but my schedule makes it difficult to ship during the week.
