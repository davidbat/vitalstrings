Rutherford B Hayes elected 19th president of US, despite losing popular vote

It is a quirk of the American electoral system that elected presidents do not need a majority of the country to vote for them. The current electoral college system was designed as a compromise between the “tyranny of the majority” by popular vote and a completely legislative decision by Congress. Each state is apportioned a number of “electorates” based on the number of Congressmen (which in turn is based on the state’s population). Those electorates vote on a winner-take-all basis: whoever wins the popular vote gets all the state’s electoral votes. Thus, it’s possible — and has happened in the past — that elected presidents did not win the popular vote.
On this day, Rutheford B Hayes was declared the winner of the presidential election and the 19th President of the United States. Hayes received around 4 million votes, compared to his opponent’s, Samuel J Tilden, 4.2 million.
Hayes’s election was also disputed by the electoral count. Because of political skulduggery, the results of three states were in wide dispute, and a committee of Congress comprised of of 7 democrats and 7 republicans met to decide to allocate the twenty votes, and thus declare a winner. Further skulduggery replaced one of the democratic members with a republican Supreme Court Justice, and all 8 republicans gave the votes to Hayes.
