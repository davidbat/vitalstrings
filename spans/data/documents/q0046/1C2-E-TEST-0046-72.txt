The Nation Divides
Sectionalist tensions reached a fever pitch with the election of Abraham            Lincoln as president. The first southern state to act was South Carolina.            South Carolina had had a long tradition of secessionist tendencies dating            back to the American Revolution and the Nullification Crises. The state            voted to remove itself from the Union in December 1860. On December            26, 1860, fearing that his Union forces would be cut off, Major Robert            Anderson moved his troops from Fort Moultrie on Sullivans Island to            Fort Sumter (Fort Sumter National Monument) in Charleston harbor. After            Anderson's men left, Fort Moultrie was occupied by forces under the            command of Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard). Tensions increased all            over the South where states' rights advocates conflicted with Federal            authorities over ownership of Federal property. In January 1861, Federal            forces at Pensacola, Florida moved into Fort Pickens (Gulf Islands National            Seashore). Confederate militia seized Fort Pulaski, Georgia (Fort Pulaski            National Monument).
Neither side was willing to make the first move towards war. An uneasy            stalemate lasted as long as President Abraham Lincoln did not resupply            or reinforce Fort Sumter (Fort Sumter National Monument). Lincoln, who            was born in the south (Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic            Site) did not wish to see the war escalate. However, on April 6, 1861,            Lincoln announced that he would provision the fort, still hoping to            avert war. The Confederate leaders felt that this was unacceptable and            fired on the fort on April 12, 1861. Union General Winfield Scott devised            a plan to defeat the South. The plan, later known as the Anaconda Plan,            was to blockade the southern coastline, use naval action on rivers,            and conduct land battles to slowly cut the South into increasingly smaller            sections.
War in the East
Thirty-four hours after the bombardment of Fort Sumter (Fort Sumter            National Monument) began, Major Anderson surrendered to the Confederates.            The fort was then occupied by Confederate troops and would remain in            their possession until near the end of the war ( Ward            et al. 1990 ). The Confederate defenders of Fort Pulaski (Fort Pulaski            National Monument), at the mouth of the Savannah River, felt that they            were safe from any Union threat. Robert E. Lee made a tour of the fort            and pronounced it capable of withstanding any siege. Lee's first military            assignment had been at Fort Pulaski (Fort Pulaski National Monument)            and he was aware of its strengths. However, Lee did not take into account            the effect that rifled cannon would have on masonry forts. In November            1861, Captain Quincy Gillmore was placed in charge of the siege of Fort            Pulaski (Fort Pulaski National Monument) ( Lattimore            1970 ). Gillmore's forces placed several batteries of rifled cannons            on Tybee Island, Georgia, approximately one mile from Fort Pulaski.            On the morning of April 11, 1862, having the other siege elements in            place, the Union guns opened fire. The fire of the rifled cannons breached            the brick wall in two places. Gillmore then targeted the powder magazine            forcing the Confederate defenders to surrender ( Anderson            1995 ).
War in the West
West of the Appalachian Mountains, the land and river portion            of the Anaconda Plan was implemented. The first strikes were at Fort            Donelson (Fort Donelson National Battlefield And Cemetery) and Shiloh            (Shiloh National Military Park And Cemetery), Tennessee. Both of these            battles were devastating defeats for the Confederacy.
Prison exchange programs broke down as hostilities increased. The Union,            realizing that this was more of a hardship for the Confederacy (which,            unlike the Union, could not easily replace lost soldiers), finally refused            to exchange. Many prisoner-of-war camps were built in both the North            and the South, with the most infamous of all at Andersonville Prison,            Georgia (Andersonville National Historic Site). The Confederacy was            having trouble feeding and caring for its own, much less captured enemy            soldiers. Both sides established military prisons that were ill suited            for the numbers of prisoners, poorly supplied, and poorly maintained.            The poor conditions at Andersonville Prison resulted in the death of            almost 25 percent of the men held there. Today, Andersonville National            Historic Site commemorates prisoners of war everywhere.
In April of 1862, the Confederacy was defeated at Shiloh, Tennessee            (Shiloh National Military Park). Shiloh was the first of many defeats            that the Confederate Army defending Tennessee would face, ending with            the loss of Atlanta, Georgia.
It was almost a year after the fall of Fort Donelson before the Union            army reached Stones River near Murfreesboro, Tennessee (Stones River            National Battlefield and Cemetery). This battle was a huge fray where            the Confederate Army was thrown repeatedly against the Union army in            a series of uncoordinated attacks. In the end, however, the Confederates            were defeated and forced to retreat. The commander of the Union forces,            William Rosecrans, had ordered the contruction of an earthen fortress            at Stones River. This was the largest earthen works built during the            Civil War.
The Union army continued its plan with the capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi            (Vicksburg National Military Park). The Union forces, under the command            of General Ulysses S. Grant, laid siege to the city of Vicksburg, which            surrendered on July 4, 1863 after receiving word that Lee had retreated            at Gettysburg. This completed the Union hold on the Mississippi River.
The same two armies clashed again at Chickamauga, Georgia and Chattanooga,            Tennessee (Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park) in June            1863. With the railhead at Chattanooga secure, the Union army began            its move south while the Confederates fought a series of delaying actions            north of Atlanta, Georgia. Each time the Confederates stopped to defend            themselves, the Union army flanked them. However, at Kennesaw Mountain            (Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park), they could not break            the Confederate line. Still, the Confederates were forced to draw closer            to Atlanta. The Union army entered Atlanta on September 2, 1864. From            Atlanta, General William T. Sherman cut a path of destruction to Savannah.            He then turned north and captured Columbia, South Carolina. The fall            of Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, and the approach of Sherman's            forces, led to the capture of Charleston and the surrender of Fort Sumter            (Fort Sumter National Monument), where the war had begun.
Naval Action
Naval activity during the Civil War can be divided into three types.            These were blockading, blockade-running, and river action. The blockade            of southern ports was a major portion of the Anaconda Plan.
The need for coaling stations for the blockade fleet led to much of            the early action in the war, such as the siege of Fort Pulaski, Georgia            (Fort Pulaski National Monument). Ironclads, following the design of            the U.S.S. Monitor, eventually rendered much of the Confederate            fleet obsolete. Since the Confederate navy was of little consequence,            the Union was free to move its monitor-class vessels up and down the            coastline. During one such movement, while being towed, the U.S.S.            Monitor sank off the coast of Cape Hatteras.
The first significant use of Union gunboats was made at Fort Henry            and Fort Donelson, Tennessee (Fort Donelson National Battlefield and            Cemetery). The Confederate high command knew that they would have to            defend the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. The ideal location for a            fort was in Kentucky, north of the Tennessee state line, where the two            rivers merge. However, since both sides initially accepted the neutrality            of Kentucky, this obligated the Confederacy to build two forts in Tennessee            where the rivers were over 13 miles apart. The forts constructed were            Henry on the Tennessee River and Donelson on the Cumberland River ( Peterson            1968 ).
The Confederacy began constructing earthworks at Forts Henry and Donelson            in the fall of 1861. Both earthworks were to be constructed in such            a manner as to best defend against both naval and infantry forces. However,            progress on the earthworks was slow due to the shortage of slave laborers,            who were already occupied at the undermanned iron works in the area.            Although additional slave labor from northern Alabama was employed,            the fortifications were still not completed by February 1862. As hostilities            increased, the neutrality of Kentucky was eventually violated. The holding            of the two forts then became extremely important since the side that            controlled the rivers would control all of Kentucky and western Tennessee,            and con-sequently have open waterways on which to move troops and supplies.
On February 2, 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant began the movement of            forces toward an engagement with Forts Henry and Donelson. The fleet,            commanded by Flag Officer Foote, and two infantry divisions attacked            and captured Fort Henry. During the attack some 2,500 men from Fort            Henry were able to escape to Fort Donelson. After Foote's successful            venture at Fort Henry, Grant's army began marching toward Fort Donelson.
Fort Donelson was commanded by Brigadier General John B. Floyd. Under            his command were Brig. Generals Gideon Pillow and General Simon B. Buckner,            and a cavalry commanded by Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest. Grant began            attacking Fort Donelson in small engagements on February 12, but a full            scale attack was postponed because Foote's gunboats had not yet arrived.            Waiting for the gunboats and reinforcements, Grant made camp. On February            13, Foote engaged the water batteries with little success. The Confederate            water batteries however, did have some success, crippling three ironclads            and wounding Foote. The Union naval boats were forced to withdraw, many            of them floating down the Cumberland out of control.
Following this battle, Floyd realized that the Confederate forces at            Fort Donelson were needed to join General Albert Johnston's forces for            the defense of Nashville. Pillow's infantry, some 10,000 men, and Forrest's            cavalry, attacked the Union's right flank under the command of General            John A. McClermand, in order to open the road to Nashville. McClermand's            forces, not expecting an attack, were pushed back after seven hours            of battle, opening the road to Nashville. Confederate forces then pulled            back into their rifle pits while Union Brig. General C.F. Smith's division            was sent against Confederate forces at Eddyville Road. After several            counter attacks by Confederate forces, Smith was able to gain the rifle            pits, controlling the road. When this plan to free the Confederate forces            failed, Floyd and Pillow decided that it was too late to escape. During            the night, the Confederate generals met at the Dover Hotel to discuss            their precarious situation. It was decided that terms of surrender would            be discussed with the Union commanders. Forrest refused to surrender            his cavalry to the Union army and escaped that night across Lick Creek            with both his cavalry and those men who also chose not to surrender.            Floyd and Pillow also escaped, fleeing to Nashville, leaving Buckner            in command of the Confederate forces.
The following morning General Buckner met with General Lew Wallace,            a subordinate of General Grant, at the Dover Hotel and discussed terms            of surrender. Grant had given orders that only an unconditional surrender            would be accepted, and on February 16, 1862, some 14,000 Confederate            soldiers surrendered to Grant's command. It was at that time that Grant            got the nickname "Unconditional Surrender" Grant.
By July 1, 1862, all of the Mississippi River was in Union hands except            Vicksburg, Mississippi (Vicksburg National Military Park). The Confederate            defenders placed artillery on the high bluffs above the river. While            the Union gunboats were in position to attack the fortress, General            Grant's soldiers were not in a position to lay siege until May 18, 1863            ( NPS 1986 ). After            a month and a half, on July 4, 1863, following the news that Lee was            defeated at Gettysburg, Vicksburg surrendered.
