HUGE impact!
The Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote. It was proposed on June 4, 1919 and ratified on August 18, 1920.  Consequently, the impact of this was enormous--it gave to women the same power and control that men had, although still held back by the values of the day.
But it did create a strong influence and created a cultural impact.  It gave women of the era more confidence and a sense that they could accomplish more.--and a thirst for more freedoms in a world where previously they were considered second class and only as a man's property.
The lifestyle changes of the 1920's showed how big and important that impact was.  Women became much more confident and wanted to utilize this new "power" in other areas, too.  They gave up many of the "controlling" aspects of the Victorian age, from the long and buttoned up clothes to new aspects of personal freedom--they started to live outside the confines of being a wife and homemaker--women got jobs outside the home, they started playing sports, they shortened their dressed and bobbed their hair--and had fun! The Roaring Twenties was a new age, and an age where women first started enjoying more freedom and influence.
That has continued on to this day, although there is still work needed to level the playing field between men and women.
