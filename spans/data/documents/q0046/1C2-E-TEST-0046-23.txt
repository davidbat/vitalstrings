Apples4theteacher                   President  coloring pages make great mouse practice activities                   for toddlers, preschool, and elementary children. They can                   also be used with beginning readers. If children are unable                   to read the sentence that goes with the coloring page, have                   them click on each word to hear the sentence. This activity                   reinforces reading skills. Most President  coloring pages                   come with a selection of sentences.
