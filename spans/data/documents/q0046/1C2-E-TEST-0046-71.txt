Primary Documents - U.S. 19th Amendment: Women's Right to Vote, 18 August 1920
Agitation in favour of        granting American women the right to vote, already active in the pre-war        years, gathered pace during the nation's involvement in World War One as        many women necessarily took up employment for the first time.  Public        meetings would be regularly placarded by women's suffrage campaigners, and        demands made of "Kaiser Wilson" to rapidly bring forward the necessary        amendment to the U.S. constitution.
Thus on 18 August 1920        (albeit after President Wilson had left office) the 19th Amendment was ratified by        Congress.  The text of the amendment is reproduced below.
