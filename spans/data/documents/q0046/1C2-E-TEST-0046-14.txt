Who was the 19th President of the United States?
Answer:
Rutherford B. Hayes was the 19th US President, serving from 1877 to 1881.
Rutherford Birchard Hayes (October 4, 1822 - January 17, 1893) was an American politician, lawyer, and military leader. Hayes was elected President by only one electoral vote after the highly disputed election of 1876. Losing the popular vote to his opponent, Samuel Tilden, Hayes was the only president whose election was decided by a congressional commission.
During his otherwise uneventful presidency, he ordered federal troops to suppress The Great Railroad Strike of 1877, and he ended Reconstruction.
