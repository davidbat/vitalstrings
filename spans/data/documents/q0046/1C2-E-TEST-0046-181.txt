A distributed digital library collaboration
This collection comprises books and periodicals published in the United  States during the nineteenth century, primarily during the second half of  the century.  Most of the materials were digitized through the Making  of America project, a collaboration of Cornell University and the   University of Michigan to preserve textual materials on deteriorating  paper and make them accessible electronically.  The materials selected illuminate the subject areas of education, psychology, American history, sociology, religion, and science and technology.  Also included are volumes of American poetry.
The mission of the Library of Congress is to make its resources available and useful to Congress and the American people and to sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations.  The goal of the Library's National Digital Library Program is to offer broad public access to a wide range of historical and cultural documents as a contribution to education and lifelong learning.  Digital collections from other institutions complement and enhance the Library's own resources.
The Library of Congress presents these documents as part of the record of the past.  These primary historical documents reflect the attitudes, perspectives, and beliefs of different times.  The Library of Congress, Cornell University and the University of Michigan do not endorse the views expressed in these collections, which may contain materials offensive to some readers.
