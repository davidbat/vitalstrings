Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran (Gulf of Aqaba ) to Israeli shipping,        thereby cutting off Israel’s only supply route with Asia and stopping        the flow of oil from its main supplier, Iran. By international law, this        was an act of war. (Reported that day in every newspaper in the world -        see report in The Times )
[Note: In January 1950, Egypt had recognised the international character        of the Straits of Tiran, when it wrote to the American Embassy in Cairo: “It goes without saying that this passage through the Straits        of Tiran will remain free as in the past in conformity with international        practice and with the recognised principle of international law”. In 1957, 17 maritime powers had declared at the UN that Israel had a right        to transit the Straits.]
By his reported decision to close the Straits of Tiran, President Nasser        has struck at Israel in one of her most sensitive areas. Eilat is her gateway        to the east and the vital supplies of oil.
...In the present atmosphere of tension, time is not on Israel's side. She        has had to react to the situation by calling up a large number of reserves,        but the economy, already ailing slightly, cannot afford for long to be bled        of the highly qualified manpower which has been taken back into the army.
...The Arab armies can certainly afford to mass their armies on Israel's        border for longer than Israel can remain at a high state of military readiness.        There is a danger that pressure from within might oblige Israel to do something        quickly rather than submit to the economic strangulation of a long period        of unrelieved tension. -

THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS: ...In the hour of crisis all Arabs stand        shoulder to shoulder; troops mobilize and offers of help flash to and fro...But        there is one element that is new and that justifies U Thant's extreme concern        and hurried journey to Cairo. The disappearance of United Nations forces        from the Sinai peninsula turns the Gulf of Aqaba back into what it was before        1956 - a bottleneck leading to Israel's only east-looking port, the entrance        to which is now again commanded by Arab batteries. Israel has often said        in the past that interference with shipping in the Gulf would be a casus        belli; and late last night President Nasser was reported to have claimed        to have closed it to Israeli vessels and any ships carrying strategic supplied        to Israel.
- Leader editorial (extract), The Times May 23rd        1967
9.30am: Israel's Ministerial Committee on Defence got underway, finally        unanimously passing a policy statement:
1. The blockade is an act of aggression against Israel
2. Any decision on action is postponed for 48 hours, during which time the        Foreign minister will explore the position of the United States.
3. The Prime Minister and the Foreign minister are empowered to decide,        should they see fit, on a journey by the Foreign minister to Washington        to meet President Johnson.
Housewives, who had displayed restraint up until then, stormed the grocery        stores, stocking up on canned goods, flour, oil and sugar in preparatrion        for a long war. Thousands of Israelis paid their taxes and others donated        cash and jewellery to the Defence Ministry to provide extra funds to purchase        weapons. Neighbourhood groups formed on their own to build bomb shelters,        dig trenches and volunteer for essential services.
The nation's mobilisation was by now far advanced and the newspapers were        filled with columns of cancelled meetings and postponed weddings "because        of the situation". Old men and women now drove the public buses since        the young drivers had been called up. Thousands of Israeli mothers baked        cakes and tarts and sent them off to the Negev so their fighters would have        something fresh to eat apart from combat rations. Civilians appeared in        the outposts handing out cigarettes, soft drinks and magazines.
Israelis were digging in, getting ready for war. [7]
Mobilisation started with phone calls to the commanders of the most important        units. One of them, a lawyer in civilian life, reported for duty with his        private secretary and driver and 'within ninety minutes was busy getting        his brigade out of the card index and into the field'. The message passed        down the line to officers who called NCOs, who called soldiers. Other units        were called up by code words that were broadcast on the radio.
. . . .
In a couple of days, most Israeli men under fifty were in some sort of uniform.        Some units had a turnout of more than 100 per cent. Overage men arrived        at their unit's mobilisation points and demanded to be allowed to fight.        One persistent 63-year-old, a veteran of the British army, was told his        unit would only take him back if he brought a jeep. the next day he turned        up with one from Hertz. [8]
President Johnson tonight condemned the Arab blockade of Israel shipping        in the Gulf of Aqaba as "illegal and potentially disastrous        to the cause of peace"..."The purported closing of the Gulf of        Aqaba has brought a new and grave dimension to the crisis. The United States        considers the gulf to be an international waterway."...Mr        Johnson condemned the "hurried withdrawal" of the United Nations emergency        force from Gaza and Sinai, and the "recent build-up of military forces in        the area".

Abba Eban
Israel’s foreign minister Abba Eban met with UK Prime Minister Harold      Wilson at 10 Downing Street. Wilson revealed that the Cabinet had met that      morning and concluded that Egypt’s blockade “must not      be allowed to triumph; Britain would join with others in an effort to open      the Straits.”
 
“The British radio and television, which I turned on briefly        before retiring, were full of sympathy for Israel, but they had a distinctly        funereal air.” - Abba Eban noted in his diary, on returning        to his hotel, that evening. [10]

“Taking over Sharm el Sheikh meant confrontation with Israel      (and) also meant that we were ready to enter a general war with Israel. The      battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel” - Gamal Abdel Nasser speech to the General Council of the International      Confederation of Arab Trade Unions
- broadcast in Arabic by Cairo Radio’s Voice of the Arabs,        Gamal Abdel Nasser, 19.35 GMT, 26th May 1967 (the speech made front page        news in The Times May 27th)
Full        text here
Egypt’s government sponsored daily paper Al Ahram carried an article        by Mohamed Heikal (a close friend of Nasser’s). He wrote that closing        the Straits of Tiran “had put Israel in a situation where        it had to react…for many reasons, chiefly the psychological, Israel        cannot accept or remain indifferent to what has taken place…Israel        has to reply now. It has to deal a blow…Then it will be our turn to        deal a second blow, which we wil deliver with the utmost possible effectiveness…Let        Israel begin! Let our second blow then be ready! Let it be a knockout!” [11]
Appendix 5
Eban opened the discussion by saying the Cabinet meeting on Sunday was        very important; there has never been a moment like this in Israeli        history; and the country is on the footing of expectancy. If Israel is denied        access to the Gulf of Aqaba, its primary line to East Africa and Asia--half of the world--would be cut off. From a legal point of view, the Law of the        Sea Conference in 1958 clearly supported the principle of freedom of the        seas as applied to Gulf of Aqaba and Strait of Tiran. Nasser has committed        an act of aggression and his objective is the strangulation of Israel. Israel        is confronted with two alternatives: either to surrender or to stand, and        we are confident if we stand we will win.

The head of the Mercaz Harav Kook Yeshiva (an academy for the advanced        study of Jewish texts) issued a ruling for his students being called up        by the Military Police that "despite the Sabbath, they should        board the trucks and go. They should board tanks and violate the prohibition        against touching their tefillin (phylacteries) on Sabbath and take them        with them when they go to join their units. ...in a national emergency,        Army service falls into the category of "pikuach nefesh" (the        saving of a life)." [32]
UK: The Chief Rabbi, the Haham and the chairman of Liberal / Progressive        synagogues asked for special prayers for peace for Israel to be recited        in synagogues throughout the country. [32]
Scores of non-Jewish Germans, including nurses and ex-soldiers had contacted        the Israeli Embassy volunteer their services or to raise funds, according        to the Jewish Chronicle correspondent in Bonn. [32]
May        27th 1967
However, Israelis took (the) occasion (to) embark on (an) emotional,        evidently sincere, exposition (of) their thesis that evidence available        to them (was) conclusive that Nasser has "crossed his Rubicon" and surprise aerial attack (was) expected any moment. My remonstrances that        our most careful and equally authoritative assessment is to contrary were        met by argument we (were) behind (the) times and essential intelligence        (in) this regard had been received in last few hours. They talked in terms        of surprise air strike knocking out Israeli airfields and rendering their        response ineffective. They said they had intercepts of Egyptian messages        to confirm situation as they see it. Also frightened by fact four MIGs overflew        Israel yesterday and Israeli Airforce (were) not able intercept.

Nasser cancels a planned Egyptian attack on Israel (Operation fajr - Dawn),        planned for following day, after it became obvious that the Israelis knew        about the plan.

Gamal Abdel Nasser
“The existence of Israel is in itself an aggression…what      happened in 1948 was an aggression – an aggression against the Palestinian      people.
…(the crisis had developed because) “Eshkol threatened to march      on Damascus, occupy Syria and overthrow the Syrian regime. It was our duty      to come to the aid of our Arab brother. It was our duty to ask for the withdrawal      of UNEF. When UNEF went, we had to go to the Gulf of Aqaba and restore things      to what they were when we were in Aqaba in 1956”
- Gamel      Abdel Nasser at a press conference for several hundred of the World’s      press.
“We will not accept any…coexistence with Israel.…Today        the issue is not the establishment of peace between the Arab states and        Israel….The war with Israel is in effect since 1948”.
-        Gamel Abdel Nasser press conference
May        29th 1967
“Now, eleven years after 1956 we are restoring things to what      they were in 1956…The issue now at hand is not the Gulf of Aqaba, the      Straits of Tiran or the withdrawal of UNEF, but the rights of the Palestinian      people.” - Nasser speech to General Assembly in Cairo:
- Vance, Vick, and Pierre Lauer: Hussein of Jordan. London: Peter        Owen, 1968
Abba Eban in his memoirs later commented Nasser’s speech “took        the conflict far back beyond the maritime context to place the question        mark squarely on Israel’s survival.” [10]
NY Times reports continuing Egyptian build up of military forces in the        Sinai and new Syrian attacks on Israel.
Washington Post reports that despite considerable provocation, Israel was        still reluctant to have a showdown with its enemies
Hussein of Jordan and Nasser of Egypt sign defense            treaty
Jordan signed a five year mutual defense treaty with Egypt, thereby joining      the military alliance already in place between Egypt and Syria.Jordanian forces      were given to the command of an Egyptian General.
"The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised        on the borders of Israel ... to face the challenge, while standing behind        us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation.        This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are        arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the        stage of serious action and not of more declarations." - Gamal        Abdel Nasser speech
Israel called upon Jordan numerous times to refrain from hostilities.        Hussein, however, was caught on the horns of a galling dilemma: allow Jordan        to be dragged into war and face the brunt of the Israeli response, or remain        neutral and risk full-scale insurrection among his own people. Army Commander-in-Chief        General Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker warned in a press conference that "If        Jordan does not join the war a civil war will erupt in Jordan". [13]
“The existence of Israel is an error which must be        rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been        with us since 1948. Our goal is clear - to wipe Israel off the map”
- President Aref of Iraq
“Under the terms of the military agreement signed with Jordan,        Jordanian artillery, coordinated with the forces of Egypt and Syria, is        in a position to cut Israel in two at Qalqilya, where Israeli territory        between the Jordan armistice line and the Mediterranean Sea is only 12 kilometres        wide”.

(NB, the newspaper referred to the “armistice line”, not the “border” which is now claimed by the Palestinians to be a legal        boundary).
…Dr Ibrahim Makhos, the Syrian Foreign Minister, left for Paris today        with a message for General de Gaulle which was officially described as dealing        with “Anglo-American-Zionist plans for widespread aggression        against the Arab people”

UK PARLIAMENT DEBATED THE CRISIS:
“Time is not on the side of peace”, said Mr Wilson solemnly        several times tonight.
Everybody agreed it was a great pity that the Secretary-General had removed        the United Nations force so hurriedly from the danger area.
"Taking the fire brigade away just when fire was about to burst        out", the Foreign Secretary (George Brown) called it, “Entirely        incomprehensible” agreed Mr Heath. “fatal and        perhaps fateful error of judgment” was Sir Alec Douglas-Home’s        phrase; this was the lat chance for the United Nations “to        get a grip on themselves and apply the principles of their Charter”
Sir Alec Douglas-Home: "...the first casualty (of this crisis)        had been the United Nations. It would need an immense effort, an almost        superhuman effort, to restore the prestige of that organization"
Sir Barnett Janner:" ...they could not expect the people of        Israel, who have done nothing wrong, to sit for a prolonged period until        the pincer movement had got them so entrapped that they could not go on."
Harold Wilson (Prime Minister): "The characteristic of this        situation is the declared aim of one side not to win concessions from the        other. Their demand is that Israel should cease to exist - indeed has never        existed.  ...What had to be sought was not merely how to avoid        war but to create the conditions of peace. One condition of a lasting peace        must be the recognition that Israel has a right to live. Israel had been        for nearly 20 years a member of the United Nations entitled to the respect        and protection of the United Nations."

“Those who survive will remain in Palestine. I estimate        that none of them will survive.” - Ahmed        Shukairy* (see note below) , chairman of PLO in Jordanian Jerusalem,        asked in news interview what will happen to the Israelis if there is a war [1]
Levi Eshkol, Prime Minister of Israel, sent message to Russian Premiere        Kosygin: "When the organs of Arab propaganda raised the contention        that Israel is concentrating forces in order to attack Syria, I invited        your Ambassador in Israel to visit the frontier to find out for himself        that there was no truth in this allegation. To my regret, the Ambassador        did not respond to our invitation. The Chief of Staff of the UNTSO checked        these claims and informed the Secretary-General of the UN and the capitals        of the region that there were no Israel concentrations on the Syrian border.        The Secretary-General even included a statement to this effect in the Report        he submitted on May 19th to the Security Council." [17]
GERMANY TO SEND GAS MASKS, Bonn: The German Cabinet decided unanimously        tonight to agree to Israel’s request for 20,000 gas masks for use        in case of an Arab attack.

Moshe Dayan
To create the illusion that war was not near Gen Moshe Dayan had thousands        of soldiers released for the weekend.
Their appearance back at their homes and on beaches and in café’s        seemed to confirm that tensions were relaxing. Some reporters gave up their        vigil and left Israel in search of more pressing stories. [9]
A CHURCHILL GIVES HIS BLOOD: Winston S. Churchill, the son of Mr. Randolph        Churchill and grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, who is covering events        in Israel for the “News of the World,” joined a queue of civilians        waiting at Dizengoff Circle on Sunday to donate blood for the emergency        blood banks which have been established in the city.
Seventy tourists from Britain also donated blood before leaving for home.
Civil defence preparations are being pushed forward. In Tel Aviv, 12,000        volunteers, including school children, joined in digging trenches and filling        sandbags. [29]
In the UK "500 volunteers, including 100 non-Jews w(ill) be        leaving London shortly to take over civilian jobs in Israel left vacant        by Israelis called up for armed service, reported The Jewish Chronicle. In Stockholm between 200 and 250 Swedes are ready to leave for Israel, including,        it is reported, some formers members of the Swedish contingent with the        United Nations Emergency Force in the Gaza Strip." Elsewhere        in the Jewish Chronicle there was a full page advertisement headed "EMERGENCY        APPEAL TO BRITISH JEWS", with the signatories including Britain's        Chief Rabbi and Haham. The text included: "Israel is in mortal        danger; she stands encircled by enemies who declare their intent to destroy        her. This is an appeal to every Jew in the country...to stand by the people        of Israel. The Jews of Israel are ready to pay for their country with their        lives; the Jews of Britain must show that they are ready to make a sacrifice        too." [29]
"Pupils at Carmel College responded to an emergency appeal for Israel        and raised a considerable sum of money. They have unanimously asked the        school authorities to give them bread and water for at least one meal so        that the money could be devoted to Israel" [29]
June        3rd 1967
The New York Times reported that Britain declared the Egyptian blockade        could lead to war. They further reported that four Syrian commandos had        been intercepted in Israel
MILITARY BUILD-UP: By this time Egypt had 210,000 troops        ready for deployment, with 100,000 of them with 930 tanks ready in the Sinai.        They had 30 Tu-16 Russian-made bombers, which were a threat to Israel’s        cities. Overall the Egyptian Air Force, by far the largest and the most        modern of all the Arab air forces, consisting of about 450 combat aircraft,        all Soviet-built and relatively new.
Syria had 63,000 troops and Jordan 55,000 – totalling 328,000 troops        ready to fight Israel.
The Arabs had twice the number of tanks compared to Israel (2,330 against        1000) and far more combat aircraft too (682 compared to Israel’s 286);        They had 1,845 armoured personnel carriers compared to Israel’s 1,500.
However, by fully mobilizing Israel could muster 250,000 men. Israel would        need to rely on the training and motivation of this largely civilian army        to counter the numeric superiority of the Arabs in manpower and weaponry. [15]
Israel’s newly-appointed Defence Minister Moshe Dayan, wishing to        confine hostilities if possible to the imminent battles against Egypt, ordered        the Israeli Army not to open a second front with Jordan in the West Bank        in the event of war. He instructed the head of the Israeli Army Central        Command: “You must not do anything to entangle Israel with the Jordanians...” [6]
June        4th 1967
Secret resolution passed by the Israeli Cabinet:
After hearing a report on the military and political situation from        the Prime Minister, the Foreign minister, the Defence Minister, the Chief        of Staff and the head of military intelligence the Government ascertained        that the armies of Egypt, Syria and Jordan are deployed for immediate multifront        aggression, threatening the very existence of the State.
The Government resolves to take military action in order to liberate Israel        from the stranglehold of aggression which is progressively being tightened        around Israel.
The Government authorises the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister to        confirm to the General Staff of the IDF the time for action.
Members of the Cabinet will receive as soon as possible the information        concerning the military operation to be carried out.
The Government charges the Foreign Minister with the task of exhausting        all possibilities of political action in order to explain Israel’s        stand and to obtain the support of the powers. [10]
King Husain
(48488 UN/DPI Photo)
King Husain of Jordan today warned Britain and the United States that they        stood to lose their friends in the Arab world for ever if they fell into        the Zionist trap of supporting Israel in the present crisis.
"There are no words I can use to express my disappointment        at the attitude that the British Government has taken with regard to the        Gulf of Aqaba", he told a crowded press conference at his        palace in Amman.

June        5th 1967
MILITARY BUILD-UP: Seven to eight Egyptian division, two        of them armoured, now deployed in Sinai: 200 tanks opposite Eilat, with        the aim of cutting off the Southern Negev. Along Israel's Eastern border:        60,000 Jordanian soldiers and 300 tanks. The Jordanian army placed under        Egyptian command units, as well as Iraq forces which had entered its territory.        On Israel's Northern border with Syria, 50,000 Syrian soldiers dug in, fortified        and protected by concrete and steel. Some 600 Egyptian, Jordanian, Syrian        and Iraqi planes ready.
War broke out on 5 June when Israel responded to the Egyptian military        build-up by launching a surprise attack on Egypt’s air force, destroying        most of it on the ground within a matter of hours.
That same morning, Israel sent a message to Jordan’s leader King        Hussein via the US State Department, the UN and the British Foreign Office,        saying that, despite the outbreak of war, it would not attack the West Bank        if Jordan maintained quiet on that front.
Jordan ignored Israel’s appeal to avoid conflict.
That morning, King Hussein received false information from Egypt denying        Egyptian losses and claiming a massive and successful Egyptian attack against        Israel. Emboldened by this information, Jordan launched immediate multiple        attacks on Israel:-
civilian suburbs of Tel-Aviv were shelled by artillery;
Israel’s largest military airfield, Ramat David, was shelled;
Jordanian warplanes attacked the central Israeli towns of Netanya and          Kfar Sava;
thousands of mortar shells rained down on West Jerusalem hitting civilian          locations indiscriminately, including the Hadassah Hospital and the Mount          Zion Church;
Israel’s parliament building (the Knesset) and the Prime Minister’s          office, each in Israeli-controlled West Jerusalem, were targeted;
20 Israelis died in these attacks; 1000 were wounded. 900 buildings          in West Jerusalem were damaged.
“Jerusalem is totally engulfed in war…” reported the          British Consul-General that morning.
All this happened before Israel reacted militarily against Jordan, or          moved at all into the West Bank.
NOTE: Israel’s entry into the West Bank in June 1967 was not part        of a premeditated Israeli plan for territorial expansion. Quite the opposite:        Israel’s own Defence Minister instructed the army not to fight the        Jordanians, or move into the West Bank. That position only changed as a        result of Jordan’s disregard for Israeli appeals to avoid hostilities,        and by its intensive bombardment of Israeli targets. Israel’s entry        into the West Bank was an act of self-defence. Its presence there originates        as a result, not of Israeli aggression, but of Jordanian aggression. [16]
10,000 at Albert Hall Rally About 10,000 people filled        the Albert Hall last night for a demonstration of solidarity with Israel.        They heard speeches from members of the three main British parliamentary        parties, from Dr. Immanuel Jakoboits, the Chief Rabbi, from Sir Barnet Janner,        MP, president of the Zionist Federation, and from Mr. Donald Silk, chairman        of the federation, which organized the rally.

Abba Eban, Israel's Foreign Minister addresses UN Security Council: "I        have just come from Jerusalem to tell the Security Council that Israel,        by its independent effort and sacrifice, has passed from serious danger        to successful resistance.
Two days ago Israel's condition caused much concern across the        humane and friendly world. Israel had reached a sombre hour. Let me try        to evoke the point at which our fortunes stood.
An army, greater than any force ever assembled in history in Sinai,        had massed against Israel's southern frontier. Egypt had dismissed the United        Nations forces which symbolized the international interest in the maintenance        of peace in our region. Nasser had provocatively brought five infantry divisions        and two armoured divisions up to our very gates; 80,000 men and 900 tanks        were poised to move." full        text here

"This morning, the Israel Defense Forces liberated Jerusalem.      We have united Jerusalem, the divided capital of Israel. We have returned      to the holiest of our holy places, never to part from it again.
To our Arab neighbors we extend, also at this hour - and with added emphasis      at this hour - our hand in peace. And to our Christian and Muslim fellow citizens,      we solemnly promise full religious freedom and rights. We did not come to      Jerusalem for the sake of other peoples' holy places, and not to interfere      with the adherents of other faiths, but in order to safeguard its entirety,      and to live there together with others, in unity."
- Moshe      Dayan

"Peace has now returned with our forces in control of all the      city and its environs. You may rest assured that no harm whatsoever shall      come to the places sacred to all religions. I have requested the Minister      of Religious Affairs to get in touch with the religious leaders in the Old      City in order to ensure regular contact between them and our forces, so as      to make certain that the former may continue their spiritual activities unhindered."
- Prime Minister Levi Eshkol

Abba Eban TV broadcast:
"Wars are not always begun by shots. They are often begun by action      and the action which really created the state of war in an acute sense was      the imposition of the blockade. To try to murder somebody by strangulation      is just as much attempted murder as if you tried to murder him by a shot,      and therefore the act of strangulation was the first violent, physical act      which had its part in the sequence. But also on that Monday morning we acted      against the movement of forces. The Egyptian air force had been making incursions      into Israel before, whether for reconnaissance or for other reasons, but there      had been a pattern of encroachment. One never knows when aircraft come towards      you what their intention is."
A document which we subsequently captured revealed a very instructive        picture. The Egyptian command was taking a very intense interest in the        disposition of Israel's very few airfields. They wanted to know where they        were, and there was an operation plan, which I read to the Security Council,        about how to knock them out. My impression is, therefore, that those aircraft        which appeared on our radar screens that Monday morning were the start of        an operation agianst our air fields. Whether they were to make the first        reconnaissance move or the first knock-out is not relevant in this era of        war. But we acted against movement towards us in the air." [18]

US President Lyndon Johnson declared: “If a single act of        folly was more responsible for this explosion than any other it was the        arbitrary and dangerous announced decision that the Straits of Tiran would        be closed. The right of innocent, maritime passage must be preserved for        all nations”.

Eight Arab heads of state attended an Arab summit conference in Khartoum        during August 29 ­ September 1, 1967, formulating what became known        as the Khartoum        Resolutions . They called for the continued struggle against Israel,        the creation of a fund to assist the economics of Egypt and Jordan, the        lifting of an Arab oil boycott against the West and a new agreement to end        the war in Yemen. By adopting the dictum of no peace with Israel, no recognition        of Israel and no negotiations with Israel, the Arab states appeared to have        slammed the door on any progress towards peace. The Resolutions became known        as the "three noes".
 
*NOTE: AHMED SHUKEIRY -        formerly an aide to the late Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini.        The Mufti notoriously sought friendship with Hitler during World War 2,        requesting: " ... to settle the question of Jewish elements        in Palestine and other Arab countries in accordance with the national and        racial interests of the Arabs and along the lines similar to those used        to solve the Jewish question in Germany and Italy." He got        as far as planning a concentration camp, near Tel Aviv. He was also responsible        for recruiting Balkan Muslims for infamous SS "mountain divisions" that tried to wipe out Jewish communities throughout the region. [19] ]
