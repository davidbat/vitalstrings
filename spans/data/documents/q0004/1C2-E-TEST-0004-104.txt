Music producer and hip hop performer Andre Young, a.k.a. Dr. Dre, co-founded the notorious rap group N.W.A. (with Ice Cube and Eazy-E).  The group was one of the most successful hip-hop groups of the late 1980s and helped lay the foundations of what's known as West Coast gangsta rap.  Dre's 1992 solo effort, The Chronic, was a critical and popular success and made his fame as a producer.  He also won a Grammy for the album's single, "Let Me Ride."  He helped launch the careers of Warren G., Snoop Dogg and Eve of Destruction , and has collaborated with a variety of artists, including 50 Cent , Eminem and The Game .  Dre's albums include Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath (1996), 2001 (1999) and the long-awaited, long-delayed Detox.  His singles include "Nuthin But a 'G' Thing," "California Love" and "Forget About Dre."
