05/13/2012Many people say beats aren't worth it but, they totally are the sound is amazing and the bass is great. The noise cancellation is great on a bus or any where people are talking and you don't wanna listen. Overall an amazing headphone.

04/19/2012I wasn't sold at first, mainly because of the price. But once I sampled them with my own music in the store, they blew away the competition! They sound better than the Bose brand for the same price. I'm hearing sounds in songs I've heard hundreds of times before that I've never heard. Tip: spend the extra couple bucks for higher end batteries, they do last longer and you'll save money in the end.

04/11/2012I can't seem to put them down, I've listen to a few headphone before I purchased Beats Studios and there where no comparison, especially to the quality sounds of the mids and lows.

04/11/2012they sound great, but you can also hear the music from outside hte headphones. So it's great for the listener, but not so great for people around you.

03/29/2012The sound quality on these headphones is fantastic. Although, I'd only recommend them for bass music. Also, the reason I gave them a 3 (being generous) is because the sound leakage is absolutely horrendous. I put the volume on my iPod halfway and my whole bus could practically hear it. So if you're a fan of low sound leakage, these aren't for you. Otherwise, you're good to go.

03/17/2012I received these headphones as a gift for Christmas. I put these bad boys through a bit of wear n tear, THESE HEADPHONES ARE TOUGH! I primarily use them on my laptop, the HP dv6 with beats audio in it. When you can change the bass on these suckers, they kick butt! Best headphones i've used. Better than most Sennheisers, and better then all Bose headphones in terms of sound quality.
