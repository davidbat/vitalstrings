Dr Dre his you hard once more with his rapper Swizz Beatz on "Chillin". His new album should arrive in April including his previous official singles 'Kush' and 'I Need a Doctor'.
I am still noddin' my heads to this fantastic song so yes, this one deserves a thumbs up! Although its been over three months since it was given a 'Thumbs Up' here at MusicRemedy. Ahhh, here it is a classic. Although you might not see it that way, it is hehe. Anyway, don't sleep on this joint. Click on the 'play'-button and enjoy!
I give it 5 of 5 stars.
Listen and/or watch the music video using the RED 'play', 'watch'-button or play/watch-links.
