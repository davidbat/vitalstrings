Not feeling constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy  or  Boogie Down Productions , N.W.A favored themes and uncompromising lyrics, offering stark descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. Propelled by the hit " Fuck tha Police ", the group's first full album   Straight Outta Compton   became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours. The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  sent Ruthless Records a warning letter in response to the song's content.
