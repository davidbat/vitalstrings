Previously, enjoying Beats audio was primarily a solo activity, but that’s about to change with the introduction of the Portable Beatbox. The unit features Monster enhanced Bluetooth technology for wireless streaming from your iPod, smartphone, tablet or computer, from up to 30 feet away. It has a sleek, lightweight design with easy to grip handles, and can be taken anywhere with AC or battery power. But best of all, it features the superior Beats sound quality tuned by Dr. Dre himself. The  Beatbox Portable will be available early next year.
