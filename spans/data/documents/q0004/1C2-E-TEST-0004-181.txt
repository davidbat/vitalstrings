Grammy Album Finds Its Audience
February 19, 2000 | RICHARD CROMELIN
Is the Southland excited about hosting the Grammys? That might explain the strong showing on the Southern California sales chart of "2000 Grammy Pop Nominees," a compilation of contenders for next week's awards including Lauryn Hill, Macy Gray, Britney Spears and Santana. The album debuted at No. 9 locally, but only No. 19 nationwide. On the singles chart, the average age dropped again with the arrival of a new Britney Spears song and the debut hit from Hoku.

Dr. Dre Leads Rappers' Surge
January 8, 2000 | RICHARD CROMELIN
Record buyers made rap the dominant sound last week, both in Southern California--where Dr. Dre topped a chart whose first four positions were occupied by rap acts--and nationally, where Jay-Z's new release entered at No. 1. In the singles chart, Jessica Simpson's long run at No. 1 was ended by teen-pop rival Christina Aguilera.

Country Makes a Rare Chart Appearance
April 29, 2000 | RICHARD CROMELIN
The Southern California sales charts don't cotton much to country music, so this week's Top 10 singles list contains a rare phenomenon--hits by not one but two country acts. Faith Hill's "Breathe" and the Dixie Chicks' "Goodbye Earl" are both strong nationally as well. On the album chart, the norten~o anthology "Guerra de Estados Pesados" shows that its surprise appearance last week was no fluke, moving up from No. 9 to No. 4 in the region.

The new No. 1 album in the nation, the Notorious B.I.G.'s posthumous "Born Again," finished at No. 3 in Southern California, unable to surpass Santana's chart fixture and the comeback album by an old rival, Dr. Dre.

Steely Dan, Pumpkins Find Support
March 18, 2000 | RICHARD CROMELIN
Two big question-mark albums--Steely Dan's return after 20 years and the Smashing Pumpkins' effort to rebound from the disappointing "Adore"--both debuted in the Top 10 a week ago, but how did they fare in their second week? In both cases, Southern California fans were more supportive than the national audience, keeping Steely Dan in the Top 5 as they slipped to No. 15 overall, and the Pumpkins far ahead of their No. 20 spot nationally.

Debut Albums Shake Up the Top 10
March 11, 2000 | RICHARD CROMELIN
Bye-bye, Celine, make way for Steely Dan. Let's get Eiffel 65, the Backstreet Boys and Snoop out of here and bring in Bone Thugs and Pumpkins. In a week of pre-spring cleaning, a trio of albums debuted in the Top 10, registering equally on the national and the Southern California charts. The biggest discrepancy was Steely Dan's two-position advantage in the band's old SoCal stamping ground.

Dr. Dre, Blink-182 and Bocelli Rank Higher Locally
December 25, 1999 | RICHARD CROMELIN
What do rapper-producer Dr. Dre, classical tenor Andrea Bocelli and punk-rock trio Blink-182 have in common? They all have albums that rank in the Southern California Top 10 but show up much lower on the national chart. Support for local heroes explains the Dre and Blink showings, and a benefit appearance and PBS special might account for some of Bocelli's burst.

Macy Gray, a critical favorite and now a Grammy nominee for best new artist, is finally showing some commercial momentum, at least in her home base of Los Angeles.

Kenny G's holiday album dropped out of the Southern California sales chart, but the saxophonist took advantage of New Year's Eve to crash the singles list with his "Millennium Mix" of "Auld Lang Syne." On the album chart, the two new entries--West Coast rapper 2Pac and New York's DMX--reflected their regional followings and reversed their national showings, with 2Pac outpacing DMX.

'N Sync Can't Top Cypress Hill in L.A.
May 6, 2000 | RICHARD CROMELIN
'N Sync may rule the national charts, but when South Gate-spawned Cypress Hill hits the stores, the rap group's home turf responds. "Skull & Bones," which includes the radio hit "Rock (Superstar)," debuts at No. 1 on the new Southern California sales chart. Another artist who made his name in L.A., Neil Young, came up just short of the Top 10 with his new "Silver & Gold," ranking No. 12 in the region. The album is No. 22 nationally.
