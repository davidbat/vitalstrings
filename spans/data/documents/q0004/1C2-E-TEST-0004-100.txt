Dr. Dre Speaks Out About the Tupac Hologram Tour
By Lyneka Little and Ethan Smith
Dr. Dre masterminded a virtual Tupac Shakur performance “strictly for Coachella,” the rapper and producer said in a YouTube message that nonetheless left open the possibility of a tour involving the late rapper.
“If a tour happens, we’ll see,” Dr. Dre said in the videotaped message, which was recorded Sunday night, apparently just before he went on stage with Snoop Dogg and a “holographic” rendition of Tupac, who was shot to death more than 15 years ago.
