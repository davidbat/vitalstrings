Using the weekend's big fight as a launching pad for his third single, Dr Dre premiered his new song "Die Hard" during the Manny Pacquiao vs. "Sugar" Shane Mosley "Fight Camp 360" Showtime special on Friday night (May 6).
With the song featuring Eminem , the legendary beatmaker spits verses about having to produce something great to please fans who've waited years for his third solo album.
As clips of boxers Pacquiao and Moseley adorning the screen, Dre can be heard rapping,"It's on, blood pressure racing, I calculate my next step, which is to accept my expectations/ Are sort of too high to meet, my reputation's in jep, yep, face it, the fans, they been upset yet patient/ I love them for that."
Meanwhile, Eminem's chimes in during the chorus, "I sit into the wee hours of the night, then we don't stop until the sunlight/ We just keep going 'cause the die-hard won't go down without a fight."
Seemingly nearing readiness, Dr Dre's third single comes as he's still yet to announce a release date for the album "Detox" - though official word is expected sooner than later.
