This explains how P. Diddy can afford to buy his teenage son a million dollars worth of luxury cars.
P. Diddy was just named the richest artist in hip-hop by Forbes magazine with a fortune of $475 million, beating out both Jay Z and 50 Cent .
Thanks to his Sean John clothing brand, Bad Boy Worldwide record label and his vodka brand Ciroc, which generates his largest profit, he's a ballllllerrrr!
Diddy recently spent his hard earned cash on a $360,000 Maybach for his 16-year-old son for "getting good grades." All I used to get was a pat on the back and extra potatoes at dinner.
Meanwhile, Jay Hova came in at a close second with an estimated fortune of $450 million thanks to his 50 million album sales, tour revenue, 40/40 nightclub chain and a stake in the Basketball team New Jersey Nets.
Third on the list was producer Dr. Dre , with $125 million, although his net worth is expected to increase when he makes a comeback this year.
In joint fourth and fifth place are rapper and entrepreneur 50 Cent , and Bryan Birdman’ Williams, the founder of hip-hop label Cash Money records, who are worth some $100 million each.
