Not only did Rick Ross manage to get Dr. Dre outta his Beat Cave, but the doctor even blessed the bawse with a
down payment on a house
$100k Hublot diamond encrusted watch. Wait, doesn’t 50 have beef with Rozay?
Other special guests included Diddy, Dj Khaled, Ne-Yo, Meek Mill, Wale, French Montana, Cassie, Wiz Khalifa & Amber Rose, Jadakiss, Styles P, Sway, Ace Hood and more.
No, of course I’m not hating :|
