Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella.
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller.
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split.
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'.
Ladies, get your paper too.
Don't expect for no man to support you.

'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos.
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads.
I'mma keep buildin'... make it killing.
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions.
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat,
But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat.
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get.
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet.
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...
[Chorus: 2x]
This is for the millionaires,
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin',
Honeys start to stare.
'Cause game is money and money is game,
And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame.
Now many people die over these dead green guys.
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise.
It's the root of all evil and sins.
Yet and still it makes the world go around,
Like my 20-inch rims...
Platinum plaques cover my walls.
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw.
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce.
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...
[Outro:]
I been there...And done that...
Been there, done that... The Aftermath!
