It’s been 11 years since Dr. Dre released his second album, 2001, and he’s been talking about its follow up for just as long.  What exactly has been the hold up??
Well, Dre’s been a busy man.  In between running a label (Aftermath Entertainment), and outside production work, he’s had to deal with lawsuits, personal tragedy, and lots more.
