Dr. Dre’s long-awaited first single from what is reported to be his officially announced final studio LP Detox finally hit the waves in its proper mastered form after an early rough draft leaked this past November.
“I Need A Doctor” featuring long-time collaborator and songwriter Eminem, is dominated by the Detroit rhyme spitter with Dre delivering his bars heading into the song’s climax.  Eminem’s urgent verses amid vocalist Skylar Grey’s haunting vocals clash violently with the rock-styled drums and dramatic keys. The theme of doctor and patient somehow meshes closely with the metaphor of mentor and student.
Em raps, “It hurts when I see you struggle/you come to me with ideas/you say there just pieces so I’m puzzled/cause the s--- I hear is crazy/but your either getting lazy or you don’t believe in you no more/seems like your own opinions, not one you can form can’t make a decision you keep questioning yourself/second guessing and it’s almost like your begging for my help/like I’m your leader, you're supposed to f--king be my mentor/I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are."
Dre adds in the closing verse, “It literally feels like a lifetime ago/But I still remember the sh-- like it was just yesterday though/You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes/Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke/Went through friends, some of them I put on/But they just left, they said they was riding to the death/But where the f-ck are they now, now that I need them/I don’t see none of them/all I see is Slim, f--k all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him. ”
The reaction from fans on Twitter has been fair, yet some fans find the dramatic style a departure from Dre’s usual work.
“Lovee the song I need a doctor by Skylar Grey, Dr. Dre, & Eminem” tweeted @sabrinajamil.
“Another new Dr. Dre track has leaked, and I'm not sure what to think of it. He trades G-Funk for Epic Pop... whaa?” said @BCandMerch.
“Why is Eminem so whiny on this I Need A Doctor? ...all this damn cryin' & sh--” added @GullyGabs
