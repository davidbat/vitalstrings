The Basics
Don’t let the decade-long delays behind Dr. Dre’s Detox trick you into thinking he fell off around the gangsta rap heyday of N.W.A. and funk-in-the-trunk anthems like “Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang” and “Let Me Ride.” While the rest of the game let their guard down, Dre was sharpening his scalpels and booking a revolving door of platinum-plated patients. It’s time to get schooled, then, as he serves up the helicopter hooks of “Break Ya Neck,” the bubbly poppin’ breaks of “In da Club,” the creeping keys of “The Real Slim Shady,” and the shimmering synths of “How We Do.”
All of which says nothing of our Next Steps, which stars such old friends as Warren G and Eazy-E.
