Dr Dre – Die Hard Lyrics
[Dr Dre - Verse 1]
My life is like a highlight reel
Some might conisder this my twilight but depending how I might feel
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years
Critics can fly kites here?
Welcome to my nightmare
Pressures on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step, pacin’
Don’t know if I’ll meet expectations
All I know is the World better get set
Dre’s in effect
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping
I’m…
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we dont stop until the sunlight
We just keep going cuz the die hard won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we dont stop until the sunlight
We just keep going cuz the die hard won’t go down without a fight
[Dr Dre - Verse 2]
It’s on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
It’s sorta too high to meet, my reputations in jep’
Yep, face it, the fans they’ve been upset yet patient, I love ‘em for that
[To be continued]
