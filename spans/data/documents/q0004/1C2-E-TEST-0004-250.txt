Dr. Dre: 50 Cent, Eminem, and Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre,  original name in full André Romelle Young   (born Feb. 18, 1965, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.), American rapper and hip-hop producer who helped popularize the gangsta rap subgenre. He is known for layering slick beats and melodies beneath harsh, often profane lyrics depicting the lifestyle of street gangs .
Born to teenage parents who aspired to singing careers, André Young took the stage name of Dr. Dre in the early 1980s. He performed as a hip-hop deejay and as part of the group World Class Wreckin’ Cru at clubs and parties in Los Angeles’s south-central district. In 1986 he founded N.W.A. (Niggaz with Attitude) with fellow rappers Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The group’s second album, Straight Outta Compton (1988), was a breakthrough for the nascent gangsta rap movement, featuring explicit descriptions (and often glorifications) of street violence and drug dealing. While Dre appeared prominently as a rapper in N.W.A., his most lauded role was as a producer, crafting ambitiously noisy, multilayered sonic collages to back the group’s inflammatory lyrics.
Dre left N.W.A. in 1992 and cofounded Death Row Records with Marion (“Suge”) Knight. That year his solo debut, The Chronic, introduced the “G-funk” production style, characterized by plodding tempos, synthesizer washes, and copious musical “sampling” of 1970s funk records, especially those by Parliament-Funkadelic . The Chronic’s multiplatinum success helped make this sound dominant in mainstream hip-hop in the mid-1990s. In 1996 Dre left Death Row to form Aftermath Records and solidified his shift from recording his own albums to producing other artists’ work. Some of his most notable protégés include rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg and Eminem . Among the artists he collaborated with in the early years of the 21st century were Mary J. Blige, Jay-Z, and 50 Cent.
