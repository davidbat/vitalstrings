Love these, incredible sound, if you have trouble fitting it in your ear you can switch the buds with the variety that come in the box. Personally i think they stay in better than my sony's!

I loved these earbuds when I first bought them. The sound quality is truly excellent.

These headphones sound great and look fantastic but i wouldn't recommend them for sports/running. The reason being each earpiece weighs quite a lot and the constant action of moving up and down while running loosens the buds and causes them to slip out.

These headphones provide the expected level of sound quality, and so far have been very durable. The included earbuds are very useful, lots of different kinds. Carry case is smart and worth having.

The design is nice, and they are comfortable to wear, however the buttons on the ControlTalk get pressed against me as I walk, changing the volume / tracks etc on my phone.
