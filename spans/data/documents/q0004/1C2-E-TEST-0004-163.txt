Is there anyone really out there thinking that it's going to be as great as The Chronic, or that thinks there will be a song as good as "Nuthin' But a G Thang?" Because here's another single from the album, and even if it's unfinished--as all signs point to--it's a 204-era hip-hop&B experiment with a lot of doctor references and weak verses. It sounds like it has holes for other stuff too, but I can't imagine anything being added that would make this NOT a mess.
