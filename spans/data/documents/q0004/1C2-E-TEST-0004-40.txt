Andre Romelle Young Jr., the son of rapper and pioneering hip-hop producer Dr. Dre Dr. Dre, was found dead in his Woodland Hills, California, home Saturday morning, according to Dre's representative. He was 20 years old.
An autopsy was conducted on Young's body Monday, but a cause of death has not yet been determined, pending the results of a toxicology report, a representative for the Los Angeles County Coroner's office told MTV News. The coroner's rep confirmed that an Andre Romelle Young Jr. passed away Saturday, but was uncertain if he was Dre's son; Dre's rep confirmed that information Tuesday (August 26).
Young was discovered in his bed at around 10:30 a.m. Saturday by his mother, who attempted to rouse him, the coroner's spokesperson said. Young was unresponsive, so she called paramedics, who responded to the scene. After their efforts to revive him failed, he was pronounced dead at the scene.
According to the coroner's spokesperson, Young had spent the previous evening with friends. His mother told police that he'd returned home Saturday at around 5:30 a.m., and that she'd heard him in his bedroom. Police said they did not suspect foul play.
A spokesperson for Dr. Dre issued the following statement Tuesday on the rapper's behalf: "Dr. Dre is mourning the loss of his son Andre Young Jr. Please respect his family's grief and privacy at this time."
An outpouring of support flooded Dr. Dre's MySpace page in the wake of his son's passing, with fans offering their condolences and wishing the family strength. "Our prayers are with you and your family," wrote one fan.
