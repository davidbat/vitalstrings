Dr Dre and the Deep Note
Hip Hop Hypocrite
When the Napster maelstrom hit the recording industry, Dr. Dre, along with        Metallica, was one of the first to hurl accusations of copyright infringement        at the popular file sharing site.
Dr. Dre is furious that people are using Napster to download his song "Lolo"         without permission or license - an obvious "copyright infringement".  The         irony is that the prominent feature of that song is a sound that Dr. Dre         appropriated without permission or license - an obvious "copyright         infringement"?
How deep is the note?
The
Empire Strikes Back
If you've been to a movie with THX sound, you've heard the "Deep Note"; the           heavily panned and faded sonic boom that accompanies the THX logo.
Allegedly, some time ago Dr. Dre requested permission from Lucasfilm, the            purveyor of the THX technology, to use the famous sound for incorporation into            one of his songs. According to Lucasfilm, they denied Dr. Dre's request to use            the sound.
Despite the lack of permission or license to use the copyrighted material of            Lucasfilm, the "Deep Note" is prominently featured on Dr. Dre's best-selling            album, 2001.    At the beginning of the first track, no less.
Consequently, Lucasfilm has filed suit against Dr. Dre (as well as the labels,            Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records) seeking unspecified damages for            copyright infringement.
Dr. Dre slaps Musicmaker
Besides slamming Napster, Dr. Dre also appeared in a related story by         demanding that Musicmaker.com immediately remove any of his songs from their         website.  Musicmaker is a custom-compilation and download site, and it had         recently announced a licensing deal with Dr. Dre's former label, Death Row         Records.  The Musicmaker website listed 27 of Dr. Dre's songs for use in         custom compilations.
According to Andre Young's (Dr. Dre's real name) attorney, when Dr. Dre left         Death Row Records, his departure contract gave the label rights only to         material "in the same configuration as then had been previously publicly         released,"  and that masters "shall only be distributed in the manner         heretofore distributed."   Presumably, this means that Death Row can         only reissue pre-existing CDs and cassettes.
Dre's attorney told Musicmaker that Death Row "has no right to distribute         individual tracks containing Mr. Young's performance, whether by digital         download or traditional compact disk distribution" and that  "by         distributing this product to the public, you act as an aider and abetter of         this copyright violation..."
Musicmaker responded that "the documents that were made known to us show that         they [Death Row] have the rights to give us rights."  Right.
