Genre: Hip Hop/RAP
Dr. Dre was accountable for moving away from the avant-noise and political posture of Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions as well as the bash vibes of old-school rap. Instead, Dre pioneered Gangsta rap and his own variation of the sound, G-funk. BDP's early albums were hardcore but cautionary tales of the criminal mind, but Dre's records with N.W.A. celebrated the hedonistic, amoralistic side of gang life. Dre was never much of a rapper — his rhymes were simple and his delivery was slow and clumsy but as a producer, he was extraordinary. Most popular Dr. Dre ringtones listed: I Need A Doctor, The Next Episode, Still Dre, Forgot About Dre, Nuthin But A G Thang, Gin and Juice.
