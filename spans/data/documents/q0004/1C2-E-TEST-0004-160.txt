(L-R) Songwriter/producer/recording artist Sean “Diddy” Combs, Paul Williams, president/chairman of the board of ASCAP and producer Dr., Dre speak during the 24th Annual Rhythm and Soul Music Awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on June 24, 2011 in Beverly Hills
*Once on opposite ends of a media-hyped east coast/west coast rap rivalry, Sean “Diddy” Combs received a touching tribute from fellow producer Dr. Dre at the ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in Los Angeles on Friday night (June 24).
Diddy was the toast of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers’ annual gala and was handed the coveted Founders Award in recognition of his contribution to the music industry.
Dr. Dre presented the prize and honored Combs in a speech, telling the crowd, “If you ask a group of people what hustle is, you are probably going to get a lot of different answers. But I think it’s doing whatever it takes to become successful. It takes focus, determination and playing the game a little harder than those around you. Sean ‘P. Diddy’ Combs is a hustler. As a matter of fact he is what I call an ‘extreme hustler.’ He is a producer, actor, has created a clothing empire, and he is also responsible for creating one of my favorite vodkas (Ciroc).”
Combs said in his acceptance speech, “Yall don’t know how happy I am right now. I’m truly, truly happy… I’m extra, extra happy right now. I truly, truly, truly appreciate this.”
Rapper Drake also made a surprise appearance at the ceremony, presenting the Songwriters of the Year award to Noah “40” Shebib and Matthew  “Boi-1da” Samuels.
Gospel stars Mary Mary received the ASCAP Golden Note Award and also performed at the show, along with R&B artist Miguel, rapper Pusha T, and R&B singer-songwriter Andrea Martin, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
