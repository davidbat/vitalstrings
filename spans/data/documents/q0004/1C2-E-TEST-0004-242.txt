If you’re an audiophile who wants it all, Beats by Dr. Dre has you covered. You don’t have to decide between comfort, durability, style and audio quality because the Solo HD Headphones have it all. Thanks to proprietary titanium coated driver technology, they produce precise sound, from ultra highs to a deep, distortion-free bass. Designed for active music fans, these lightweight wireless headphones use Monster ControlTalk for hands-free calling so you don’t have to watch your cell phone every five seconds to make sure you don’t miss any calls.
