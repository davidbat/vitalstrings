Born Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro on February 5th 1985 in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal. He started playing football with Andorinha when he was only 8 years old and moved onto CD Nacional when ten. He later transferred to Sporting Lisbon where he scored twice on his full club debut.
After impressing against Manchester United in the European Cup, Alex Ferguson decided to acquire Ronaldo to fill the void left by the sale of David Beckham to Real Madrid, Cristiano went to the English club for £12.24 million.
Ronaldo was named the fans 2005 FIFPro Special Young Player of the Year. After performing well at the 2006 World Cup, Cristiano angered English fans with some of his on the pitch antics, especially in the game that saw his team mate Wayne Rooney sent off against Portugal. It was thought likely he would leave the club, but this never materialised and Ronaldo is still at Old Trafford.
He made his full debut internationally for Portugal in August 2003 and was part of the team that lost to Greece in the 2004 European Championship Final.
