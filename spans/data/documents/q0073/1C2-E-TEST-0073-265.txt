Cristiano Ronaldo was born on the 5th February 1985, on the small island            of Madeira, Portugal.
Cristiano Ronaldo arrived in Manchester amid a media storm. Manchester            United had managed to sign the player without the Press suspecting anything.            As the Stock Market was told that the player had been signed, hundreds            of journalists flooded up to Manchester to get a proper look at one            of Manchester United's youngest signings.
Named after Ronald Reagan, due to his father's respect for the man,            few would have gambled that this child would make it to the very top            of the Football tree, especially with Madeira mainly being used for            farm-land. He has one brother and two sisters, and it is family whom            he deems most important in his life.
It was on the dusty back-streets of this small island that Ronaldo            learnt his first few tricks, and it was also on this Island that he            was first scouted. By the age of twelve Ronaldo had established himself            as the best player on the Island, able to use his ball skills and pace            to get past full-grown defenders for Andorinha.
Having been recognised as a serious talent, all that was left was for                       the big Portuguese clubs to scrap it out for his signature. Though Porto                       and Boavista came in for him, he could only ever play for Sporting the                       club he supported as a boy.
He progressed slowly through the youth ranks, although all those who                       worked with him were impressed with the talent that he had for his age,                       as well as his maturity.
At the tender age of 17, Ronaldo was thrown in at the deep end with            his            first game against Moreirense. Two goals on his first appearance not                       only gave him his dream debut, but also endeared him to the fans, who                       soon learnt to chant for the ball to be passed to him. A goal against                       title-rivals Boavista also saw him rise to the top of the "Fan's                       Favourites" list.
His skills were watched closely by all of the big clubs in Europe,                       including Liverpool and Juventus, in the U-17 European Championships.            His            dazzling skills put England U-17s out, and everyone who watched felt                       they had seen something special.
At the end of his first season at Sporting he was linked to Liverpool.                       Though he claimed he was extremely happy at Sporting, he was also            flattered by the interest of such a big club, who used to do well in            the            Premier League.
Sporting finished top in the league, and Ronaldo was hailed as the                       future of the club, alongside Quaresma, another Portuguese Starlet.
As it was, both moved away, with the money on the table to much for            the Portuguese club to turn down. Best-friend Quaresma ended up at Barcelona,            whilst Ronaldo came to the bright red of Manchester.
The deal saw Ronald become the most expensive teenage signing in            Britain, with Manchester United paying £12.24million over two            seasons, in two            equal payments.
Those who had not seen him play baulked at the price such a lot of                       money for someone unproven!
Those who had seen the Man Utd vs. Sporting friendly just three days                       before, however, knew that this player was special. Playing for Sporting,                       Ronaldo had taken the game to the reds, and was the main reason that                       Manchester United lost 3-1. After the game, all the United players could                       talk about was how well Ronaldo had played, and they begged Sir Alex            to            buy him. Sir Alex had been following him for months, but decided that                       the time was right not least because other clubs were getting            increasingly closer to buying him.
An so, on 12th August 2003, Cristiano Ronaldo held up the famous Red                       shirt, with his favourite number 7 (it is hero Figo's number) for all                       the press to see.
A new star had been born.
His first performance for the club was against Bolton. He entered the            fray with an hour gone, with United 1 0 up. A standing ovation from            the fans at old Trafford did nothing to settle his nerves, but he rewarded            the fans for their trust. A man-of-the-match performance followed, and            Ronaldo became legend. He had a hand in two of the goals, won an unconverted            penalty, and mesmerised the Bolton defence.
The next day the media proclaimed him one of the best players ever            for            United, comparing him with Red-Legend George Best. Much had been seen,                       but much is still to come. Ronaldo got better and better as the season                       went on, eventually leading the Reds to the FA Cup - though somewhat                       suprisingly, he was not awarded "Man of the Match in that game".            It was            a disappointing season for United, but no-one was questioning whether                       Ronaldo was worth the £12million Sir Alex had splashed out on            him just            eight months previously - everyone could see that Ronaldo was going            to            be an incredible player.
Ronaldo matured so much during his first year at United that he became                       a regular in the Portuguese national first team squad. He played a            major role in their progress to the final of Euro 2004, where they opposed                       Greece. In a match that was played on Portuguese soil, Portugal            deserved to win the game, but were beaten by a goal scored on the            counter-attack by a defensive Greece team.
Ronaldo was also selected for the Portuguese Olympic football team            for 2004. He is fast becoming the greatest player who ever lived.
