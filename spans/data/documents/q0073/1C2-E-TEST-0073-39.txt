Cristiano Ronaldo had another dig at Lionel Messi after the Portuguese was taunted by Denmark fans during the countries' Euro 2012 match in Kharkiv.
The 27-year-old missed two gilt-edged chances with Portugal 2-1 up, before Nicklas Bendtner equalised for the Danes, as supporters chanted Messi's name whenever the Real Madrid attacker was on the ball.
"You know where he [Messi] was at this time [last year]? Do you know? He was being eliminated in the Copa America, in his own country. I think that's worse, no?" Ronaldo said when asked about the grief he had received.
Argentina were eliminated from the Copa America on 16 July by Uruguay on penalties at the quarter-final stage despite largely dominating the game last year.
Ronaldo has previously taken aim at his competitor when, after the 2011 Champions League semi-final between Real Madrid and Barcelona, the former Manchester United player claimed: "I'd like to play against 10 men too". This was in reference to Messi scoring twice only after Pepe had been controversially sent off for the home side.
Messi scored 73 goals for Barca in comparison to Ronaldo's 60 last season, but it was the latter who won the Primera Liga, effectively winning the title with the second in a 2-1 win at Camp Nou in April.
Portugal ultimately went on to win their second Euros match 3-2, courtesy of an 87th-minute Silvestre Varela strike, which puts them level with their conquests in Group B.
