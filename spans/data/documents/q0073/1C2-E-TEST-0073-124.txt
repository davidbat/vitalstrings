Cristiano Ronaldo helps Portugal beat the Czech Republic
Cristiano Ronaldo during Czech Rep. 0-1 Portugal game in Euro 2012
Balls on the post, impossible saves by Petr Cech, endless shots and a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo in the last ten minutes of the game put Portugal through to the semi-finals of Euro 2012.
Coach Paulo Bento once again used the same team in the starting line-up, a formula that has led to three consecutive wins, after losing the opening game to Germany. Portugal started the game a bit shaky thanks to the pressure the Czechs applied in the first 10-15 minutes, but after that, just as had happened against Holland, Portugal took control of the game.
Once again, the midfield trio of Jo√£o Moutinho, Miguel Veloso and Raul Meireles was relentless and seem to be playing better with every game. Highlighting one or two players on this team seems a little unfair, but C Ronaldo, Pepe, Nani and Moutinho were possibly amongst the best in a team were the spirit of solidarity seems to prevail.
