Unquestionably one of the most gifted footballers of his generation, Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo seems certain to usurp Luís Figo as his country's most capped footballer of all time. His three seasons at Real Madrid CF have yielded a phenomenal output of goals and he also scored seven times for his team in UEFA EURO 2012 qualifying.
• Born in Funchal, Madeira, he joined Sporting Clube de Portugal after a successful trial and scored twice on his league debut; was whisked away to Old Trafford at 18 after impressing Manchester United FC players in a pre-season friendly to inaugurate Sporting's new stadium.
• Won the FA Cup in his first season with United, scoring the opener in a 3-0 final defeat of Millwall FC, and came to the fore for Portugal at UEFA EURO 2004, registering his first international goal in the opening loss to Greece and excelling thereafter, winning a place in UEFA's All-Star Squad.
• Scored seven goals in 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying and helped Portugal reach the semi-finals; returned to England and enjoyed a brilliant 2006/07 campaign, winning the league with United and both player and footballer of the year prizes (as well as the young player gong).
• Retained both those personal accolades in 2007/08 thanks to a phenomenal scoring run: top marksman in the Premier League (31 goals) and UEFA Champions League (eight), both of which United won.
• The 2008 UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year, he helped United to another domestic title in 2009 but lost the UEFA Champions League final to FC Barcelona in his last game for the Red Devils.
• Signed a six-year contract with Madrid in June 2009 after a world record €92m move and in his second season picked up the ESM Golden Shoe, registering a record 40 Liga goals in 34 games, and headed the winner in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona.
• Bettered that total in 2011/12 with 46 goals as Madrid won the Liga title, but it was not enough to retain the ESM Golden Shoe due to Lionel Messi's astonishing half-century of strikes for Barcelona.
