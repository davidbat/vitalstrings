Cristiano Ronaldo:
"I feel sad. Losing a semi-final in the penalty shoot-out is always painful, but it is a lottery: the luckier side wins"
"I think it was a good tournament on our part. We did very well. We are amongst the best four team...s in Europe and the only reason we do not reach the final is because we were not lucky. "
"We have to be proud of what we did, but we are a bit frustrated because we know we could reach the final."
"I gave my best, so I am satisfied with that I did. We deserved to be in the final." See More
