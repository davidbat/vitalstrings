Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates winning La Liga… by giving the finger to Javi Martinez
Thursday, May 3rd, 2012
It should have been a sweet moment for Cristiano Ronaldo. Winning the La Liga title for the first time in three seasons in Spain is undoubtedly a huge personal achievement and no doubt in large part thanks to his incredible 44-goal haul.
But, just after referee José Antonio Teixeira Vitienes blew the full time whistle at San Mames to indicate Real Madrid were champions, CR7 got a little angry.
According to reports, Ronaldo had been involved in a running verbal battle with Bilbao’s Javi Martinez, who was sent off, and at full time shouted at a stream of obscenities at the young Spaniard before flashing an obscene gesture.
The Catalan press have predictably pointed to this moment as proving that Real Madrid lack the class of champions.
And suggest that the Portuguese forward is frustrated at being two goals behind Lionel Messi in the La Liga top goal scorer race.
UPDATE: It has emerged that Javi Martinez reportedly said the following to Cristiano Ronaldo – “Don’t celebrate too much, I’m a World Cup champion and you’re not, clown.”
