Video: Cristiano Ronaldo to be the Euro star?
Cristiano Ronaldo (27) scored an incredible 60 goals in 55 games for Real Madrid last season, helping the club to regain the La Liga title from Barcelona.
On a personal level he was still eclipsed by Lionel Messi who bagged an even more incredible 73 goals in 60 games. Next week the Portuguese star has a chance to win the one major title which Messi will never get his hands on, unless he discovers he has an Irish granny. Mother O’Messi.
Ronaldo is in top form going in to the tournament and he pulled off a rather tasty little trick in Portugal’s friendly defeat to Turkey yesterday, bamboozling Real team-mate Hamit Altintop (29). He did also miss a penalty in the game but we’ll skim over that, being a friendly and all.
If Portugal are going to do anything of note in this tournament then they’re going to need Ronaldo to play at the level he does for Real Madrid.
Portugal are 18/1 to win Euro 2012 and 11/10 to get out of a group which contains Germany and Holland.
Ronaldo is 14/1 to be the top goalscorer and 16/1 to be the player of the tournament. If they can get out of their group then these bets will have legs.
