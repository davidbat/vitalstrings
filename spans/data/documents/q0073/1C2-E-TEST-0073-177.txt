Based in Hillsborough, North Carolina, Eurosport the Fabled Soccer Traders was founded in 1984 by the Moylan family to provide American soccer players with equipment and information unavailable anywhere else. Since our first soccer ball left the warehouse, Eurosport has worked to promote the game of soccer at all levels and to educate players, referees and their families about soccer and its equipment.
