Carles Puyol and David Villa reject Spain Euro 2012 invite - report
Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo insists missing a penalty during Portugal's friendly against Turkey will not impact him at Euro 2012.
Ronaldo missed a spot-kick during the 3-1 defeat which has led to some questioning how much of a threat Portugal will be at the European Championships, which kick off on Friday.
But the most expensive player in the world does not believe his miss is cause for concern.
"I have often scored from the penalty spot, but missing a penalty is something that happens in football", Ronaldo told A Bola.
"Lately it’s been difficult, but I’m still doing my best."
The former Manchester United winger also insisted that Portugal will bounce back from the defeat to Turkey.
"We played well against Turkey, but they managed to find the target three times," he added.
"We’ll bounce back at the European Championships. Our heads have not dropped."
