English: Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro; born 5 February 1985 he is a Portuguese footballer who plays as a winger for Spanish La Liga club Real Madrid and the Portuguese national team. Ronaldo began his career as a youth player at C.D. Nacional and his successes with the team led to a move to Sporting two seasons afterwards. Ronaldo's precocious talent caught the attention of Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and he signed the 18-year-old for £120 million in 2003. In 2009 he moved to Real madrid in the most expensive transfer ever. He earned his first cap for the Portuguese national team around the same time he moved to ManUtd. He won his first club honour, the FA Cup, the following season and reached the final of the UEFA Euro 2004 with Portugal, scoring his first international goal in the process.
