Portugal’s assorted legends were not shy about showing their delight as Cristiano Ronaldo scored against the Czech Republic last night.
Luis Figo was quick off the mark, jumping out of his seat to celebrate. Next-door-neighbour Eusebio either no longer has the reaction speed or prefers to make sure the goal has been given before celebrating.
It did briefly look like Eusebio might go tumbling head-first down the stadium, but a quick embrace with Figo ensured that didn’t happen.
Unfortunately, this was one of the highlights of the match.
