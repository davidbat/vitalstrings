Cristiano Ronaldo, the captain and star of the Portuguese national team, believes that his team is under no pressure, as it prepares to test itself in the most difficult group in the upcoming European Championship.
After qualifying for the tournament via a playoff, Portugal is not considered a candidate to win the title, especially after being placed in Group B with Germany, Netherlands, and Denmark.
"We know we are in the group of death with Germany, Netherlands, and the team that eliminated us in the qualifiers, which was Denmark,"said Ronaldo, 27, in an interview published by Real Madrid's sponsor Bwin.
"They are going to be complicated matches, but I trust that we can overcome the group stage. I know we won't be favorites. That is even better," he added.
Portugal was booed by its own fans on Saturday, as it tied Macedonia 0-0 in a game that raised a lot of doubts about the team.
The Portuguese team will now face Turkey in another friendly this weekend -- its last match before traveling to Poland, where it hopes Ronaldo's speed, talent, and strong shots will prevail.
Although the captain would love to lead Portugal to its first title, the Real Madrid player expects Spain to defend its 2008 title.
"I don't think there will be any surprises in this Euro Cup. Spain is very strong, and there are teams behind them that are very strong, so I don't think there will be any surprises," said Ronaldo.
After barely losing the title in 2004, playing at home and losing the final to Greece, Ronaldo's fitness will be crucial for a team that is not shy about relying on its star.
Ronaldo scored only one goal in the last three international competitions in which the team has competed: Euro 2008, the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
