For Portugal  coach Paulo Bento one key task will be to bring out the best in Ronaldo,  enabling him to repeat his club form.
Since succeeding Carlos Queiroz in September, 2010, he appears to have  found the right approach to this challenge, Ronaldo's form for Portugal having  improved along with his integration into the team.
Ronaldo was Portugal's  top scorer in the qualifiers and it was one of his trademark tomahawk free  kicks that inspired a memorable 6-2 aggregate victory over Bosnia to  secure their passage to the finals.
His combination of speed and stepovers may be thrilling, but it will be  his part in Portugal's  collective effort that matters as they bid for success.
