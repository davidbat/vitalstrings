Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo insists he is putting talk of the Ballon d’Or to the back of his mind and focusing on Euro 2012.
Ronaldo was outscored in La Liga by Lionel Messi, by 50 goals to 46 and the Argentine has won the last three Ballon d’Ors, keeping the Portuguese from the game’s highest individual honour.
Los Blancos manager Jose Mourinho has gone on record as stating that, as Ronaldo’s goals helped Real Madrid to win the Spanish title, while Messi’s Barcelona came second, it is the Portuguese’s that matter more. And Mourinho is sure 2012’s Ballon d’Or should be Ronaldo’s .
A good display at Euro 2012 with Portugal would surely help Ronaldo’s case, even though he claims it is not part of his thought process.
"What I did with Real Madrid is behind me now and I’m focused on the Portugal team", said Ronaldo.
"I hope to have a good tournaments with my team-mates and the national team.
"We will see what happens in the end but, honestly, I am not concerned about the Ballon d’Or. I don’t even think about it."
