Portugal defeated the Czech Republic minutes ago to seal a place in the semi-finals of this year’s Euro Championships.
Portugal had many opportunities to score, especially in the second half of the game.  Cristiano hit two posts before placing a brilliant header into the back of the net.
The game ended 1-0, but Portugal could have easily been up three or four goals after the final whistle.
Portugal now awaits either Spain or France.
Way to go Portugal!
