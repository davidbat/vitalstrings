Funchal, Madeira, Portugal
Footballer, father, bringer of lady wood.
Member of Real Madrid football club who became the highest paid soccer player in history when he joined the team, signing a contract reportedly worth up to $131.6 million dollars. That's more than most people make in a YEAR.
Nicknamed "Euro-Greasy" for his slick backed hair, constant tan, waxed body and possibly because he may have boned Paris Hilton once. Gross.
Dates beautiful models and drives expensive cars. But take all that away and what do you have? One of the richest, most elite athletes on the planet. Damn you Ronaldo … you beautiful bastard.
