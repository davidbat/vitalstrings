Fan dies after 11 nights without sleep
Germany took a big step toward the Euro 2012 quarterfinals, drowning the Netherlands 2-1 Wednesday night to leave the Dutch on the ledge. Mario Gomez was the hero scoring two goals to lead his side while Bastian Schweinsteiger was the architect.
In our other game of the night, substitute Silvestre Varela blasted home a late match-winning goal that saved the blushes not only of Portugal , but also of their star Cristiano Ronaldo in Lviv. The game was a stone cold classic that will also reinforce the perception that the Real Madrid striker simply cannot hack it on the big stage.
Let’s begin in Kharkiv, where Holland are close to completing an epic collapse. Someone had to go out of the “group of death,” but few pegged the Dutch as the team to flame out in such spectacular fashion – usually they wait until later in the tournament to descend into petty bickering and infighting.
Before Wednesday night, Wesley Sneijder said what many long-time observers of this team have thought. His call for his teammates to get rid of their “pathetic egos” wasn’t the greatest or the most successful rallying cry, but it was candid. And in that spirit, let’s be candid about what ails this team: they simply do not like each other.
How a team that plays Nigel de Jong and Mark van Bommel could give Bayern’s Schweinsteiger so much space to roam and create is hard to fathom. How Holland managed to get such limp performances out of Sneijder and Arjen Robben is not.
Germany simply tormented what stands revealed as a very average back line, running Gomez right through John Heitinga, and forced the Dutch to chase. Bert van Marwijk’s midfield stagnated as Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira sped past them. It’s difficult to see van Bommel continuing at this level past this game.
