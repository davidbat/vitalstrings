About Us
myfootballnews is the ultimate football news aggregation service in the UK. We collect football news stories from the Barclaycard premiership and Nationwide leagues from all the major football news sources on the net including newspapers, football magazines and TV stations such as ITV and Sky, and bring them together in one easy to use site, grouping the stories by team and by player, giving credit to each news source. Whether the news is about your clubs finance situation, potential loan signings or transfers, it's all available here. This site is for football news, as in soccer, and has nothing to do with the NFL, College Football or any other similarly named sport that involves using your hands!
