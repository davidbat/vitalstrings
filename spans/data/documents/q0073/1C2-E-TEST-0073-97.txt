Euro 2012 – Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal powers Portugal to semifinals
0 comments
Much like some guy named LeBron, Cristiano Ronaldo has been busy silencing his critics lately.
The mercurial star’s header led Portugal to a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic and into next week’s semifinal against either Spain or France on Wednesday.
He’s not the best interview in the world, but he seems to be having fun.
"I remember in the last game I hit the post twice, too," Ronaldo said after the match. "But the most important thing is I managed to score this time, we won and are in the semifinals. Now it is big smiles and good music."
Greece meets Germany in today’s quarterfinal, where the Greeks will be looking to channel a 2004-like defensive effort.
If Germany scores early, this game could quickly turn into a rout. But, if the Greeks manage to clog up the midfield and frustrate the Germans, we could have a match on our hands.
