Euro 2012: Cristiano Ronaldo eyeing knockout stage
Portugal attacker Cristiano Ronaldo is confident that his side can qualify for the knockout stages of Euro 2012, despite having to face the likes of Germany, Holland and Denmark in the “Group of Death”.
“We know we are in the most difficult group of the Euros, but it is not anything to regret, because you cannot change it, and we have known it for months,” he told Uefa.com.
“So we have to be prepared, we have no other option. These will be extremely difficult matches, but I think Portugal will do a good job and we will progress to the next phase.”
The Real Madrid talisman went on to reveal that Portugal are eyeing a win against Germany in their first fixture in Group B.
Three points against Germany would be absolutely golden for the Portuguese, but can they pull it off? We shall see.
Euro 2012 Betting Odds: Group of Death
According to the bookmakers, the Seleccao are   4/1 to win Group B  at the 2012 European Championships.
Meanwhile, Euro 2008 runner-ups Germany are 6/5 to top the Group of Death in Poland-Ukraine this summer, while 2010 World Cup runner-ups are 9/5 to finish atop Group B.
Last and probably least, Euro 1992 champions Denmark are 16/1 underdogs to win Group B.
Now then, you do not have to win your group to reach the knockout stages of Euro 2012. A top-2 finish will do just fine.
Subsequently, betting on group qualification shifts the betting odds quite drastically.
See for yourself. Here are the betting odds for the teams to qualify from Group B of the 2012 European Championships:
