Cristiano Ronaldo was able to earn Portugal a spot in the Euro 2012 semifinals with a tremendous late goal against Czech Republic. That's where the team's run will come to an end, however.
After another season with eye-popping numbers for Real Madrid , Ronaldo has carried his success over to the European Championships. He's scored three goals in four games and has looked like a man on a mission the entire time.
More importantly, his goals have come in key moments, when he's been known to struggle. He scored twice against Netherlands after Portugal fell behind 1-0, and then yesterday's header, which crushed all the confidence the Czechs had built up.
Scoring big goals like that will do wonders for Ronaldo, who has criticized for his lack of production for the national team despite gaudy club numbers.
The problem for Portugal won't be Ronaldo, but rather the team surrounding him. The Seleccao das Quinas lack depth, and that will be exposed by the winner of today's clash between Spain and France.
Beyond Ronaldo, Helder Postiga and Nani are the only two players Portugal can rely on to help create offense. While they are both solid contributors, neither of them can carry the team on his back if Ronaldo even has a slightly off night.
Which team will reach the Final?
Portugal
