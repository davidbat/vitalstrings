Cristiano Ronaldo is the most expensive player in football history after moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid in a transfer deal worth 80 million pounds. Ronaldo spent his early years playing for his local team, Nacional, and by the time he turned 12 years old, he already made his name for himself as one of Madeira's top soccer player. It wasn't long before he started to catch the attention of other big Portuguese clubs. Among them were Porto and Boavista, however he eventually chose to play for Sporting which was a team he followed while growing up. He was then spotted by former Liverpool manager, Gerard Houllier at the age of sixteen but Liverpool had no intentions to sign him at that time because they thought he was too young and he needed more time to develop his skills. However, in the summer of 2003, when Sporting played against Manchester United and defeated them, Ronaldo caught the attention of Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. Ronaldo earned his first cap for Portugal in 2003 and became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed for them after the 2002–03 season. In the 2006-2007 season, Ronaldo broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and picked up his first league title with Manchester United. In 2007, Ronaldo won PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Player of the Year, PFA Fans' Player of the Year, Portuguese Footballer of the Year, FWA Footballer of the Year, Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year and Manchester United's Players' Player of the Year. Ronaldo won the Premier League Golden Boot in 2007–08, European Golden Shoe in 2007–08, 2010–11, FIFA World Player of the Year in 2008.
