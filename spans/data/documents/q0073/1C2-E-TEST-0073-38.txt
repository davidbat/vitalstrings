PORTUGAL star Silvestre Varela has defended Cristiano Ronaldo’s ability to find his form in major tournaments.
Ronaldo has looked a shadow of the player who hit 46 La Liga goals for Real Madrid last season, and has failed to impress in other Euro and World Cup finals.
But Varela, who scored the late goal to earn a 3-2 win over Denmark, insists the winger is having to be more conservative for the overall good of the side. He said: “Club form has nothing do with international form.
“Football is a team game. When the team is playing well, then all the players are also doing well and Ronaldo has nothing to prove to anyone. He has been doing well for us. He’s an excellent player and captain.”
Danish fans tweaked his nerves by chanting the name of his great rival Lionel Messi and, instead of brushing aside the comments afterwards, Ronaldo rose to the bait.
“Do you know where Messi was this time last year?” he said.
“He was being knocked out of the Copa America on home soil with Argentina. I think that’s worse.”
