Euro 2012 Dream Team: Cristiano Ronaldo, Xavi & Van Persie make the cut
Goal.com –  Mon, Jun 4, 2012
With the opening of Euro 2012 edging closer, Goal.com has created a dream team consisting of the stars who will feature at this summer's tournament.
Germany goalkepper Manuel Neuer gets the nod ahead of Gianluigi Buffon and Iker Casillas.
In defence, Ashley Cole and Lukasz Piszczek will occupy both wing-back positions, with Holger Badstuber and Giorgio Chiellini holding the fort in the centre.
Our four-man midfield has plenty of attacking talent on show with Spain's David Silva on the right wing, and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo starting from the left. France's Yann M'Vila features as the holding midfielder, with Xavi as the team's playmaker.
Two of Europe's most prolific goalscorers have made the cut up front, with Germany star Mario Gomez accompanied by Netherlands forward Robin van Persie up front.
Goal.com's Euro 2012 dream team XI (4-4-2): Neuer; Piszczek, Chiellini, Badstuber, Cole; Silva, Xavi, M'Vila, Cristiano Ronaldo, Van Persie, Gomez
