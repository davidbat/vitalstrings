Cristiano Ronaldo Has 'Ambition to Win' Euro 2012
Cristiano Ronaldo hits the field during the Portugal vs. Poland match on Wednesday (February 29) in Warsaw, Poland.
The 27-year-old Real Madrid star spoke to reporters after the game ended in a 0-0 draw.
“We have to have ambition, both in football and in life, to always be the best. We will go to Euro 2012 with the ambition to win,” said Cristiano.
“We know it will be difficult, but we have to think logically. The group stage will be difficult, but nothing is impossible,” he added. “I hope people come to the stadiums and assist us, as it was in 2004 – putting flags on homes, chantings songs of encouragement for us. We are all pulling in the same direction.”
