Cristiano Ronaldo has added another award to his growing collection, but this one isn’t for his familiar dribbling skills or scoring abilities.  This award labels him ‘The Most Beautiful Player Of The Tournament’.
LG electronics polled 12,000 women across Europe  to name the most handsome player in this year’s Euro Championship, and Portugal International, Cristiano Ronaldo took the honors.
According to the LG Poll, Cristiano’s ‘talent and Latin good looks’ won him the title.
French forward Thierry Henry came in second, ahead of injured Italian skipper Fabio Cannavaro and Freddie Ljungberg of Sweden who drew for third place.
Cristiano Ronaldo ’s biggest fans apparently hailed from Italy, Germany and Sweden.
