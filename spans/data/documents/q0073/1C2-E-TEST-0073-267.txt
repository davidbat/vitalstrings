Germany have won their last 15 competitive matches
Italy have scored 13 goals in 14 matches this season
Expert verdict
The extra 48 hours rest could swing this semi-final in Germany favour and Joachim Low's side should be able to book their spot in the Euro 2012 final. Italy are pretty in midfield and mean defensively but their attack is nowhere near as strong as Germany's formidable front four.
