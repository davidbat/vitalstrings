Is he having a better year than Messi?
Um yes. And it’s not close.
In reality, he said “Para ti”, or ‘For you’. It’s a dedication to his son.
Just to clear this up, he said para ti which means for you, aka the goal was for his son. After the match he said he dedicated the goal to his son, so ya. He did the same thing after he scored vs Netherlands on fathers day.
That hand grabbing thing is also a reference to his son, as was the thumb sucking thing he did after he scored vs Netherlands.
Also he says ‘Para ti’, or ‘For you’. Funny that a native Portuguese speaker might speak Portuguese. He also dedicated his MoM award to his son via twitter.
I don’t get it. It’s clear even if you don’t speak his language that he forms three syllables and unless he draws out Messi to three syllables, it won’t work.
Hilarious.
