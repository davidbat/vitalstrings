Cristiano Ronaldo
Crisitano Ronaldo might be a more recognizable star across the pond that he is here in the States (since we’ve adopted David Beckham, thank you very much), but for anybody who can recite European soccer clubs like their ABC’s, they know that Cristiano is a celebrity father with great Euro-trashtastic style (if you’re in to that sort of thing).
The celebrity father was spotted taking in some tennis at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. In true Euro-style, the Portuguese soccer player had on a black leather jacket and scarf and more styling products in his hair that Jersey Shore’s Pauly D could even imagine. He also showed off some serious bling to the cameras.
Check out our photos of Cristiano and tell us, do you think he’s got great dad style?
