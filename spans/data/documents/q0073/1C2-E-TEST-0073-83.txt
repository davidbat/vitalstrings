Cristiano Ronaldo has courted controversy by refusing the sign an autograph for a Portugal fan because she was wearing a Barcelona shirt.
The Real Madrid star is preparing to lead Portugal into Euro 2012, but he has scored a PR own goal by disappointing a girl, whose father told Portuguese daily Record about the incident.
"She was sad and dejected", he said.
"When I asked her what had happened, she just said ‘Cristiano did not want to sign an autograph for me because I was wearing a Barca shirt’."
And the girl’s father slammed Ronaldo’s attitude towards a faithful fan.
"It was difficult to see the disappointment in the eyes of my daughter and to have to explain why a member of the national team she has followed and supported in all the training sessions, turned his back on her."
Ronaldo may be able to make up for the incident in part if he can help Portugal navigate a difficult Group B at Euro 2012.
The country are placed alongside Germany, Denmark and Holland in what looks the tournament’s "Group of Death."
