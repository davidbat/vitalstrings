Cristiano Ronaldo broke the Primera Division record for goals in a single season after netting his 39th and 40th in an 8-1 thrashing of Almeria.
Ronaldo move two clear of the previous all-time record, which he jointly held (before the game) with Real Madrid’s Hugo Sanchez, from the 1989-90 season, and the legendary Athletic Bilbao striker Telmo Zarra, who achieved the feat during the 1959-60 campaign.
He scored a total of 53 goals in all competition this season, including the match winner to win the Copa del Rey .  Too bad Real couldn’t win the La Liga or Champions League despite his excellent form.
