Cristiano Ronaldo believes his “fantastic” season for Real Madrid has already placed him firmly in the running for this year’s Ballon d’Or award – and admits that his performance at this summer’s European championship could sway the voting in his favour.
Ronaldo helped Real Madrid claim their first La Liga crown in four years with his 46 league goals last season, but was pipped to the Pichichi award by three-time world player of the year winner Lionel Messi after the Argentine netted a staggering 50 league goals for Barcelona.
But the 27-year-old, who won the Ballon d’Or prize in 2008 while still at Manchester United, insists he is “not that concerned” about claiming a second individual accolade and is now focused on performing for his country in Poland and Ukraine.
“I’m not the one who judges who deserves to win the Ballon d’Or, but I think I’ve had a fantastic season,” Ronaldo told AS.
“I’ve won the most difficult league in the world. I agree with what Mourinho said, but what I want now is have a great European Championships, because that could also help me in the Ballon d’Or, although honestly it’s not a matter that concerns me much.
“I’m happy with the season that I’ve had, but I’m already only thinking of helping my country now.”
