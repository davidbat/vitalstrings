How could you forget STOUT? Great place!

How about the Blue Oyster Bar?? It’s soooo awesome…

Nice list. Obviously no place is the right place for everyone. Tempest Bar has long been one of my favorites when I’m with a group on a budget; it draws an eclectic crowd for $4 pints, darts and a pool table, and you order in pizza from next door. Stout was long one of my favorites when I was a little younger, but it’s just too damn loud and crowded for me now. Tir na nog is just right for me now; upscale, a great ambiance, reasonably priced $5 pints and a great bar menu.

Seven Bar and Grill is a terrific upscale place. For those who want pure sports bar, Mustang Harry’s is outstanding.

+1 for Tir na nog; this is my favorite restaurant in the city, not just near Penn Station. The Shepherd’s Pie is the best you’ll ever have, anywhere. Another favorite is Seven Bar and Grill on 7th Ave near 30th St; a sexy bar, outstanding menu, great crowd.
