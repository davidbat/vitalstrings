How big is your carryon? If you are landing at 5PM at EWR I would take the train into Penn Station as the bus will most likely be very slow and not scenic at all. Once you are in Penn Station you can try for a cab which will be also slow but for a short ride not too bad. If your bags are small the subway is doable but if it were me I would probably just walk
