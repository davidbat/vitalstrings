★★★★☆ good public transit options here

Penn Station is a huge, old, lovely train station in between the Mount Vernon and Station North neighborhoods.  They offer service to DC and point in between on the MARC commuter line.  Amtrak from here leads as far north as Boston and Vermont and south to North Carolina and even New Orleans.  Light rail and bus stops take you to other places in Baltimore.  There's a small coffee shop, a news/snacks shop, and a small, kind of dingy-looking restaurant.  Architecture is gorgeous, train service can be dodgy--but that's Amtrak/MARC's fault, not the station's.
