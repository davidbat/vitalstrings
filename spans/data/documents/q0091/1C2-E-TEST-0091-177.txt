ENOUGH ALREADY!
I have been NJT commuter for 4-5 years now. NE Corridor line is one of the worst I have traveled in my life.
To be fair to NJT, almost _all_ the time, it is Amtrak’s fault. But come on! There has to be an end to this!
In last three days, I have lost at least 30-60 minutes each way due to either switch problems, or low power or signal problems – all caused by Amtrak.
NJT should buy off the NE Corridor tracks and get done with Amtrak altogether.
Thanks for making my holidays as miserable as possible, you in incompetent idiots.
Thanks

There was also low voltage discovered in the brains of those who run the transit systems in this country.

On the bright side of things, it wasn’t nearly as bad as the Eurostar delays of recent days.

I’m a NJ Transit rider.  Monday’s delay:  35 minutes.  Tuesday’s delay:  25 minutes.  Wednesday:  Diverted to Hoboken resulting in a 25-minute excursion through PATH.
This transit system is broken and shameful.  I cannot rely on this service to get me to an important meeting on time, or even just to make it to work at the starting time so I don’t lose my job.  Is that so much to ask?  Just look at how mass transit by train works anywhere else in the world.  Even “developing” countries have better, more reliable transportation (and often cheaper).  America can do better — this is its largest and most sophisticated city!  The ongoing problems with NJ Transit’s reliability will continue to cripple the New York City metro economy for years to come.  And the new ARC tunnel, which will be years late and overbudget, is going to send trains to the wrong place (not Penn Station, but blocks away), leading to confusion and inconvenience.  Who is in charge?

sure lends a lot of credence to those enviornmentalists screaming for more rail traffic and reducing auto and air transportation.

Looks like AMTRAK, NJT and Port Authority will be joining MTA in demanding a bailout from the taxpayers.

This morning, I overheard my Metro North conductor telling another passenger that the train on which we were riding was two cars short because conductors and engineers at Southeast, the end of the Harlem line, were swiping cars from the trains behind them so as to have a full complement of cars.   Our train (which left Chappaqua at 9:45 p.m.) was packed, with  passengers standing in the aisles.
What is going on with the commuter lines?

This is why we should all be grateful that NJ Transit is on its way towards getting its own two tunnels into Penn Station. It’s so aggravating that Amtrak’s problems end up disrupting all NJT service into New York as well.

Yikes.  Put against somewhat similar problems being experienced by the train service at the English Channel tunnel, does this lead to worries of hacking or some form of cyber terrorism?  It’s been predicted — is it finally happening?

I have an Amtrak ticket from DC to NY for 7PM tonight so I’m vitally interested to know when (if) service will be resumed.
I just checked on their website and there isn’t a word about this outage.  There was similar “silence” on Monday after the storm when they were cancelling various NE Regional trains – including my 5:30AM one out of Penn Station.
Why have a website if you don’t use it for important service advisories?
Amtrak is a national disgrace.

Whew! And the LIRR is proud to announce that service is fine and is continuing to operate with the same normal, everyday delays.

Gee, I wonder if the Amtrak problems have anything to do with the budget problems and lack of government support.
Other countries have great transit systems because they pay for them! Out government seems to be convinced that transit should be a profit making business as opposed to a public service.
You know, like the completely private, self sufficient highway system we have.  Oh, wait!

I have been taking NJ Transit for 20 years and
the delay is getting worse. The service is getting
worse and train cars are getting dirtier and dirtier.
I do not want to get political but if United States
can build the best fighter jet and aircraft carrier
in the world, why can’t they build a better
public transportation system.  They are worse
than those in some of third word countries.

These problems have become the norm. I think of it in this way: I’m not buying a train ticket from NJ Transit, I’m buying a chance that I might get there.
It’s just not a reliable way of getting to work. I’ve looked at timetables from 100 years ago — service was faster then.
NJ Transit is forever announcing that PATH will cross-honor NJ Transit tickets, but the reality is that does not happen — gates/turnstiles are not opened for NJ Transit ticket-holders; no PATH employees are available to let NJT travelers onto the PATH trains. Instead, as seen in Newark today, they insist that NJT customers pay the PATH fare.

I was one of the lucky riders stuck in the tunnel this morning for almost an hour — our train was a minute away from the station (second one in the tunnel). At one point we were told that the train will be go back out of the tunnel and use the other track. After waiting for 45-50 minutes the train was pulled into the station.
Monday morning was a 40+ min delay and there have been 15-20 delays everyday in both direction this week. The service is horrible. The daily commute is the worst part of my day/job.

to #5, Events like this lends credence to the point that much more funding is needed for mass transit infrastructure–not that it should be discouraged as a method of transportation.

NJ Transit is pretty good about warning of delays, etc. if you sign up for their free text alerts, which can be customized by the trains you usually take.  Because of Amtrak’s problems, I’ve been getting a lot of these lately.

My commute is more stressful than my job. This is gettng beyond funny.  This morning’s problems was the straw that broke the camels back. Went to the NJT customer service window to file a official complaint and the lady behind the window hands me a blank piece of paper to file a complaint. They don’t even have a form to fill out a complaint.  I did stroll around the Secaucus station, and it is quite impressive. It surely is nice to have a station named after a sitting in Senator who has managed to have almost all trains make a stop at Secaucus adding 4 minutes to the already long commute. Amtak making sure that the Acela is always on schedule – else congress will cut funding does not help either. Acela will kick all NJT trains to a local track. Who is doing the math on the  lost productivity 100 people on Acela or 2000 people reaching late at work daily?

This year I am grateful that I have escaped the godforsaken hellhole that is the NJ commuter rail system. For 13 months I paid NJ Transit $227/month for the privilege of riding in cramped, overcrowded trains that were often subject to heavy delays, if they got there at all. Two winters ago I waited for almost an hour in sub-freezing weather for a train to come. When it finally arrived it was so packed that the only place to stand was in the vestibules between cars, exposed to the cold air with the tracks with the tracks visible beneath our feet. It took 2 hours for us to make the normally 40-minute journey to Penn Station, and I’m lucky I didn’t lose a digit to frostbite. Then there was the time when all NJ transit trains were cancelled starting at 4pm on a workday. Penn Station was absolute pandemonium, NJ Transit/Amtrak customer service was unreachable, and even though there were announcements that buses and PATH trains would be honoring NJ Transit ticket holders, there was no way to determine what bus would take you near your house besides trekking to Port Authority and waiting in a very long line to ask or flipping through a myriad of schedules (turned out that there was no bus route that went near my house, anyway!) Even on a regular day the commute was horrendous–at Metropark, a station that services over 250,000 customers a day, there was only one tunnel that ran from the southbound side of the tracks to the parking lot. Sometimes getting to your car/bus and getting out of the parking lot could take almost as long as the train ride itself!
In short, I guess now I have something to remember whenever I curse the MTA for a 15 minute delay on the subway. It could be a lot worse!
