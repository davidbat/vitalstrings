Locate a Signature Station at a Penn State Campus
If you receive a password reminder for your PSU Access Account, be sure to change it before it expires! If you don't change your password in time, or you've forgotten your PSU password, you are required to go to an Information Technology Services (ITS) Signature Station to reinstate (reset) the password. The requirement to physically go to a Penn State Campus includes Penn State Cooperative Extension staff.
