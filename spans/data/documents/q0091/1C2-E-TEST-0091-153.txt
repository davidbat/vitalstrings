Penn Station East Coast Subs has opened its newest Ohio restaurant at 6302 Harrison Ave.in Dent, Ohio.
“I’ve always had a great deal of confidence in the Penn Station concept.,” says John Dorger, managing owner at P.S. Management, Inc. “The high quality, great taste, and crave appeal of the food makes Penn Station an instant family favorite.” P.S. Management, Inc. owns five Cincinnati Penn Station restaurants, as well as 13 in the Greater Dayton area.
 
“We had been watching the growth along Harrison Avenuefor several years now and saw the potential for a new Penn Station restaurant there,” Dorger says. “When we heard about the new strip center across from VeteransPark, we quickly pursued it ...  We’re very excited about this location and the opportunity to serve the residents and businesses in Dent.”
 
This newest Penn Station restaurant features the latest décor package with a newly designed front counter and the grill facing the customer. Besides speeding up service times, this new design allows customers to see their sandwiches being freshly grilled-to-order. “The look of our new restaurant is more up-scale and has a family friendly feel,” Dorger says.
In addition to the traditional menu of subs, Penn Station now also features items like our crowd pleasing Cold Deli Classic Sub line, a Catering menu, Box Lunches, and Fresh Baked Chocolate Chunk Cookies. In fact, every Tuesday at Penn Station, customers can receive a free Chocolate Chunk Cookie bite with any purchase (while supplies last).
 
“Our customers have told us over the years how much they appreciate our high quality freshness and grilled-to-order taste,” says Craig Dunaway, President of Penn Station, Inc. “We are happy to bring that quality to the Dent area.”
