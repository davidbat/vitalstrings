Penn Station (as it is           commonly called) is           the busiest             train station in the USA, by             far. ( Here's info           on trains to Boston .)
The mundane (well, actually, ugly) appearance           of the building's  exterior does           not reveal its function, so entrances to           the station are difficult for non-New Yorkers           to find. Get to Madison             Square Garden at 8th Avenue and 33rd           Street ( map ),           and ask.
The heart of the station is the subterranean main             concourse with its annunciator             board listing           all the arriving and departing trains.
Trains           are in the station and available for boarding           for only a few minutes, so the concourse           is full of passengers waiting for the annunciator           board to show their track number.
When the track           number appears on the annunciator and is           announced on the public address system—usually           only five to eight minutes before train departure           time—passengers go to either the East or West track-numbered escalators           and descend to the track to board the train.
Amtrak has           a tidy waiting area for its Acela express           train passengers.           Show your Amtrak ticket to enter.           There's free Wifi.
Shops, snack stands, a bar and restaurant are on the sides of the concourse.
Long Island               Rail Road trains           are boarded in a separate, lower part of           the station. Follow the signs. Numerous MTA           subway lines can also be accessed beneath           Penn Station.
Grand Central             Terminal , New York's other           major railway station, is for commuter             and regional           trains. It's located at Park Avenue and 42nd             Street ( map ),             13 blocks (1.5 miles/2.41 km) northeast             of Penn Station: walk north 9 blocks north             on 7th Avenue, then 4 blocks east on 42nd             Street.
You can walk between           stations in about 45 minutes,           35 if you have no luggage and you walk fast. A taxi might take 15 minutes once you actually           get in a cab (there may be a waiting line           for taxis).
Pennsylvania Station was           once a grand Doric-temple monument to 20th-century           progress, but the imposing original station,           designed by McKim,           Mead and White, was razed in 1964           to make way for a new Madison Square Garden           sports and show arena, and an office tower,           with the charmless but functional station           beneath.
