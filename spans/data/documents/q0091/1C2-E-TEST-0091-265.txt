Welcome to Pennsylvania's official web site
on vehicle emissions inspection!
The emissions inspection program was developed by the Departments                      of Transportation and Environmental Protection with input from the public and the various representatives of the auto                      industry.
Tailored to meet Pennsylvania's specific air quality improvement                      needs, the program focuses on motorist convenience and choice.
If required for your vehicle, the emissions inspection is                      due once a year at the same time or before your annual safety                      inspection .
