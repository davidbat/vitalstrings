In 1963, one of the last structures of neo-classical architecture in New York City was demolished to make room for a massive sports arena.  
Pennsylvania station, originally constructed in the Beaux-Arts-style between 1905 and 1910 by the Pennsylvania Railroad, was a masterpiece of pink granite, marble columns, and arched glass windows. 
Before the station's bulldozing, which inspired large-scale demonstrations, a New York Times article famously wrote:
"Until the first blow fell, no one was convinced that Penn Station really would be demolished, or that New York would permit this monumental act of vandalism against one of the largest and finest landmarks of its age of Roman elegance."
Although the above-ground portion of the station was ultimately replaced by Madison Square Garden, its destruction is seen as the impetus for the city's landmarks preservation law, which later spared Grand Central Station from a similar fate. 
The following collection of photographs come from the Historic American Buildings Survey and were snapped only a few years prior to the original structure's demolition.
