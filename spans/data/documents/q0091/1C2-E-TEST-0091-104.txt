Our Chelsea NY Neighborhood
From its famous art galleries to the infamous Chelsea Hotel, from the Chelsea Piers to the Penn Station, this neighborhood offers a rich panoply of culture and treasure trove of shopping, dining and entertainment opportunities.
Eventi is ideally situated for you to enjoy Chelsea to its fullest. Just a block from our boutique hotel is Manhattan's century-old flower district where, despite its small size, still presents a lush oasis of flowers, plants and more that spill out onto the sidewalks and brighten even the gloomiest day.
Then there's Macy's flagship store, about five blocks from our luxury hotel. Macy's is the second largest department store in the world and an icon in popular culture. Sponsor of the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the store has starred in film and song, most famously in the 1947 classic Miracle on 34th Street. There are also more intimate luxury boutiques that dot the neighborhood, making Chelsea a shopper's dream come true.
Chelsea may be best known, however, for its arts community. It has become a global center of contemporary art. The West Chelsea Arts District houses nearly 400 art galleries and countless artist studios. The People's Improv Theatre, Joyce Theater, The Kitchen, TADA! Youth Theater and Dance Theater Workshop offer exciting performance art, while Madison Square Garden, Manhattan Center and Jacob Javits Convention Center showcase large events. Art museums and public parks, such as Hudson River Park, the elevated High Line and the new public plaza adjacent to Eventi, round out the scene.
