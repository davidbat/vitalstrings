Sterling Heights, MI

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!  This is how much I love this place, I live in Sterling Heights and drive here just to get a sub at this location.  
I love the variety of subs that they offer.  
Between the classics (Philly Cheesesteak and Dagwood) to the different (Chicken Cordon Bleu and Reuben).  Personally I feel they include a little too many onions in the Philly Cheesesteak, but you can always tell them to give you less or none...this does make it better.  
I've tried about every sub on this menu and personally my favorites are the Reuben and the Artichoke subs.  The subs work great because the bread is freshly baked and freshly grilled.  
What makes this place even better are the fresh cut fries.  These are amazing.  Plus even better that they offer malt vinegar in the restaurant or in packets to go.  
The wait is a little longer, but it's what you would expect for freshly assembled sandwiches.  Plus the fries are cooked at the right times so that they are perfect when you get them.  
Some other notes: If you join their email list, you get a heads up as to what their specials are, which are pretty good.  Ryan B. pretty much mentioned the types of sales that they offer.  
I promise that if you go here, you will not look at Tubby's or any other grilled sub chain the same way.
