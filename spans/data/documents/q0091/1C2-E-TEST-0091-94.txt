But DON’T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT -  these are quotes from Penn Station East Coast Subs customers.
The family is Hooked  & the kids cannot wait as every Thursday we go to Penn Station – thanks for coming to town.
 Their subs are crazy delicious... grilled to order and they are generous with the meat. The bread, baked in house daily was soft and perfect.
 Your meatless grilled artichoke sandwich is the best. Artichoke hearts, provolone, mushrooms, oregano parmesan and mayo – makes quite a tasty meal.
 And the one that says it all – Love it! My friend introduced me to Penn Station and I still haven’t recovered!
