No, there are no public storage lockers at Penn Station (or Grand Central). Not since 9-11.
There is a luggage storage company right outside Penn Station that you can try. But beware: this is not a recommendation. This information was actually posted by a spammer, who was obviously an employee (or the owner) of the company.
