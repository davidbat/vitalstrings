Madison Square Garden
Billed as The World's Most Famous Arena---at least according to their website--- Madison Square Garden (or MSG) sits directly adjacent to Penn Station along Seventh Avenue. The Garden, as it is commonly referred to, hosts a wide range of shows, games and concerts each day. Acts are constantly changing, so there's always something or someone new to see. The NHL's New York Rangers and the NBA's New York Knicks both play all home games at Madison Square Garden. The Garden also hosts the famed Westminster Dog Show each year. Tickets to events range greatly, depending on the event, and can be booked through the Madison Square Garden website.
