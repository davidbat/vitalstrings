Grand Central Terminal (Park Ave and 42nd) handles the MetroNorth trains that run upstate NY and Connecticut. There are many shops, restaurants and bars inside the terminals so if you are running late you can usually grab a quick bite to eat or a newspaper or magazine before you jump on the train.

Port Authority Bus Terminal Midtown 8th Ave and 40th Street is the hub for all long distance and commuter bus service in and out of the city of New York. You can get service from companies like Greyhound and Adirondack from this terminal. The Port Authority can be a little rough like any big city bus station so keep that in mind.
