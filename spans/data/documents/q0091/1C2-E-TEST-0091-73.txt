The quick-service restaurants, found mostly in Ohio, Indiana, and about ten other states, offer a menu of classic submarine sandwiches, along with its popular Philadelphia cheesesteak. The menu also includes wrap-style sandwiches, salads, and vegetarian options. CEO Jeff Osterfeld opened the first Penn Station in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1985.
