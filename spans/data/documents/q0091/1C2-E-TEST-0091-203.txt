[UPDATE BELOW] The Office of Emergency Management says that there's been a "minor train derailment" at Penn Station, and NJ Transit and Amtrak are experiencing delays this evening. Though the derailment isn't considered major, the delays are nothing to sneeze at; Fox 5 reports hour-long delays on NJ Transit Northeast Corridor/North Jersey Coastline trains leaving New York. The derailment happened this morning, when a Midtown Direct train went off the tracks as it was leaving the station. 300 people were on board, but there were no reported injuries.
UPDATE: NJ Transit and LIRR say the delays are continuing into the evening commute. According to the NJ Transit site:  Expect crowding conditions, as some trains will be combined to reduce congestion.  Please allow 20-30 minutes of additional travel time... All Midtown Direct trains will originate and terminate at Hoboken Terminal, instead of New York.  PATH trains are cross honoring NJ TRANSIT tickets and passes between Hoboken and 33rd Street. All Midtown Direct trains will make all local stops, resulting in longer travel times for some customers.
And Long Island Rail Road commuters should expect delays of up to 30 minutes, with the cancellation of some evening trains expected. Here's a list of all the cancellations .
The tracks where the derailment occurred are usually shared by the railroads. To make up for the loss of capacity, New Jersey Transit has taken over some tracks normally reserved for the Long Island Rail Road. But NJ Transit spokesman Dan Stessel tells City Room that the problem should be cleared up overnight, with normal commuting resuming tomorrow morning.
