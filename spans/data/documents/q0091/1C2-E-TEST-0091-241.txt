Madison Square Garden
We are only 3 blocks from Madison Square Garden in Midtown. Because they know we are one of the best bars near Madison Square Garden, Knicks and Rangers fans meet with their friends to get ready for the game or to cap off the evening. We are sports fans too so we made sure to set up Mustang Sally’s to fit a sports fan’s idea of what good bars are. At Sally’s, you don’t have to deal with the obscene prices at MSG. Concert goers still energized from the show also find Mustang Sally’s the best bar around Madison Square. Coming to an authentic Irish bar will make any big Madison Square event a couple pints better.
Pub Proud to be Irish
Mustang Sally’s is one of a rare breed of true Irish pubs in NYC. Staying true to our roots, we have a real wood interior that is both comfortable and intimate. Like your favorite bars, you can share a few with friends and order a tasty starter from our menu. Others sit at the bar and enjoy the pleasant atmosphere of a true Irish bar. As much as we are a Midtown bar, we stand out amongst Chelsea bars too. We invite in customers who in their pub crawl want to enjoy themselves at the best pub in Chelsea.
Penn Station’s Bar
Of all the bars Penn Station commuters visit, Mustang Sally’s is the best. You can get a drink and not worry about missing your train if you heading out to Long Island or New Jersey because we are only a few minute away. The day in day out commute can take a lot out of anyone, so we give you quality beers perfect for unwinding for a few minutes before the train. We also are the one of the bars near Penn Station that you can bring your work friends to have a few laughs.
