About Penn Station
Located underground in Pennsylvania Plaza in New York, Penn Station is the United States' busiest transportation location. Over 300,000 passengers travel through its terminals daily, over double the number that travel through Grand Central Station. Penn Station offers services by Amtrak, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), New Jersey Transit and some smaller bus companies. The transportation services offered through the MTA include the New York City Subway and bus systems.
The original Penn Station was completed in 1910 and was designed by McKim, Mead and White. The structure was highly luxurious and was, in its time, considered to be an artistic and architectural masterpiece. Covering over seven acres, Penn Station was much larger than any other building in the city and was one of New York's most prized possessions. It featured a huge waiting area that was modeled after the Roman Baths of Caracalla and was one of the largest public areas in the world, and the largest in New York City.
The station was demolished in the early 1960s and construction on the new Pennsylvania Plaza was finished later in the century. At the time, there were many who expressed outrage at the station's destruction while others supported the city's move to construct the new plaza, which included Madison Square Garden.
Today's Penn Station uses the original platforms and site of the original and is divided into the "Amtrak", "NJ Transit" and "LIRR" sections. Each operation manages its own location and unique decoration. Additionally, the station houses entertainment including Amtrak's exclusive ClubAcela Lounge, and a United Airlines Ticketing Counter. Passengers also have access to New York City's subways and bus lines, as well as other limited forms of transportation.
