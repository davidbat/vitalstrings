Parking Attendant
Dedicated parking is marked for those with disabilities only.  A disabled license plate or mirror tag is required.
Wheelchair lift is a platform-mounted lift for loading passengers onto trains without onboard ramps from low platforms.
Accessible platform is a barrier-free path from the drop-off area outside the station to the station platform.
A high platform is a platform at the level of the vestibule of the train, with the exception of Superliners.
For passengers who cannot walk far or at all, we offer a wheelchair to move the passengers around within the station.  At some stations this may be a battery-powered people mover. The wheelchair or other types of movers must not leave the station or be moved onto the train. Â
