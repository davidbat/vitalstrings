"Indigo, Perfect, Perfect, Perfect" Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest on Jul 21, 2011
“
When in NYC, I've tried the top to the bottom, been there, done that in the past ten years and over fifty visits. What has Hotel Indigo stand out is the outstanding commitment to detail. From the first greeting upon entering to dealing with the General Manager, and every step in between. You will not be disappointed. There is a very bright, committed and dedicated staff who cares. Cares about you, your comfort more than the typical.... How much revenue are we going to earn per guest. The restaurant and bar are awesome...... One need not leave a two block area of the hotel on W. 28th St., there is so much there from every area of comfort. The Flower District is fun, safe and easily accessible to two subway lines and more.... So much to see. The property is fairly priced, easy to use and comes with the benefits of a caring and devoted staff. Can't miss here.
