How much is parking fees for parking at Penn Station Baltimore MD?
In: Travel & Places [ Edit categories ]
Answer:
The going rate for parking at the garage at Penn Station is a max of $12 per day. The monthly rate is $200 but there is a long waiting list. I have found private business offered outside parking within a couple of blocks of Penn Station around $125 monthly.
There's also a 24/7 public parking garage across the street from Mt. Royal Station at The Fitzgerald.
While not as close as the Penn Station garage, it has the same $12 max daily rate & it's monthly rate is only $130.
