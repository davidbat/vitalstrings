How come NJ Transit doesn't say the Hamilton train runs to Penn Station anymore?? HELP!?
I'm going to NYC tomorrow morning & I'm going to drive to Hamilton Station (I live in S Jersey) & get the train to Penn Station in NY. I did this once before a year ago. I know Hamilton goes to Penn Station...people commute this way every day! But I went on njtransit.com to get the schedule and Penn Station isn't even on the list AT ALL. I need to know what time to go tomorrow, I need to be in Hamilton around 6am. Can anyone help me??
