[ edit ] PRR stations not named Pennsylvania Station
Other major PRR terminals that never received the Penn Station name include Washington, D.C. 's Union Station , Chicago 's Union Station and Cincinnati 's Union Terminal . These were all used by other railroads in addition to the PRR. Dennison, Ohio 's PRR station was named Pennsylvania Railroad Depot and Baggage Room while Fort Wayne, Indiana 's station, though officially called Pennsylvania Railroad Station was also named Baker Street Station .
[ edit ] Penn Central Station
With the 1968 merger of the PRR into Penn Central , several of the Pennsylvania Stations were renamed on June 6 to Penn Central Station. Philadelphia 's Pennsylvania Station-30th Street became Penn Central Station-30th Street, and Baltimore 's Pennsylvania Station and Pittsburgh 's Pennsylvania Station both became simply Penn Central Station. Additionally, the New York Central Railroad 's (NYC) Buffalo Central Station and Michigan Central Station in Detroit, Michigan received the new name. The stations in New York City and Newark, New Jersey kept the old name, the former because Penn Central also operated Grand Central Terminal .
The two former New York Central Railroad stations (Buffalo and Detroit) have since closed, and the Baltimore and Pittsburgh stations have returned to the name Pennsylvania Station. The Philadelphia station is now known as simply 30th Street Station .
