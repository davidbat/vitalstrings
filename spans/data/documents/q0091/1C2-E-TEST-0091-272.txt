Boy, I learn something new from Flyertalk everytime I post!  Thanks, CPX and guv, for informing me of Bolt Bus and the Megabus.  I may someday need that info.  As for my nephew, he needs to get to Central PA and that ain't easy.  He's coming into JFK around 4:15 pm.  Needs to clear customs and get his baggage and he has no tickets for the Air Tran or LIRR or Amtrack.  He is not familiar w/JFK, AirTran or NYC...so you can see why I don't think he'll make his 6:30 train to Philly, right?  But, ever the optimist, I'll keep my fingers crossed that he does.  Thanks for taking the time to respond.
