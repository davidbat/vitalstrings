Officials mark launch of free north-south bus route downtown
By Liz F. Kay and Katherine Smith, The Baltimore Sun | June 7, 2010
The Purple Line of the Charm City Circulator shuttle service opened Monday, ferrying passengers — for free — between Ostend Street in South Baltimore and Penn Station.        The hybrid electric buses, which are funded by increases in city parking taxes, will operate at 10-minute intervals along the north-south corridor, the second of three shuttle routes to open.        Ted Walls, a Federal Hill accountant whose office is along the Purple route, was excited about the opening.

Rolling geek tweetup on Amtrak gets temporarily delayed by broken-down train
Gus G. Sentementes | May 24, 2012
Today is a big day for Baltimore (and East Coast) geekdom. It's    Geeks on a Train   : a rolling tweetup that started in Washington DC this morning, with a denizen of DC techies and entrepreneurs boarding an Amtrak train. The itinerary: stop at Baltimore and other major stops along the East Coast Amtrak corridor and connect with geeks and techies in other cities, all the way up to Boston.      But there was an early snafu. The    #GeekTrain    broke down somewhere around Odenton, Md.       "Train now stuck and without power," tweeted    @BenSlavin    from the train.       In Baltimore, this city's geek contingent waited at Penn Station -- maybe it should be called Geeks in a Station and not Geeks on a Train,    tweeted Scott Paley   . Baltimore entrepreneur Greg Cangialosi tweeted a picture of the board at Penn Station, with the Northeast Regional #172, from Washington to Boston,    saying "DELAYED"   .      But alas, Amtrak sent a diesel engine to replace the electric one, some tweeters said.

Good riddance to the Penn Station sign
March 22, 2010
I will not be sorry to see the mechanical schedule board at Penn Station replaced, and I shall sbsolutely rejoice that vocal announcements are going digital ("At Penn Station, clack-clack no more," March 22).        It has been nearly impossible to understand train announcements because of echoes and the unintelligable enunciation of the staff. Whirring floor fans in hot weather did not help, either. The final straw has been the rude and condescending attitude of the representatives if one dared ask a question.

Creaky
By John E. McIntyre and The Baltimore Sun | March 9, 2012
There was a fine coating of pollen on the car this morning, suggesting that the winter forced-air-dryness allergies are being supplanted by the spring filthy-tree-sex allergies.             Then, yesterday evening I tripped and fell heavily (I never grasped the technic of falling gracefully) at Penn Station in Baltimore, so that last night and today I have been nursing a painfully sprained and swollen ankle.             It's possible that my customarily sunny disposition may be somewhat clouded over.             So now I am at the paragraph factory to oversee the production of half a dozen sections by midnight or 1:00 a.m., making use of the long-neglected newsroom wheelchair, and giving a fresh sense to the term "hell on wheels.

A 100th birthday present for Penn Station: Get rid of that ridiculous statue
September 16, 2011
Baltimore should take pride in the celebration of Penn Station's 100th anniversary. What a radical contrast one experiences approaching this architectural gem when confronted by the hideous man/woman statue. This eyesore is inappropriate and an embarrassment to our city which is desperately trying to improve its image. At a time when recycling unwanted metal is strongly encouraged, this statue is a prime candidate.      Hobart V. Fowlkes

City to install traffic light near Penn Station
By Michael Dresser, The Baltimore Sun | November 30, 2010
The Baltimore Department of Transportation will install a long-sought traffic signal and crosswalk next year on Charles Street near Penn Station to help pedestrians cross the busy northbound street, the city's traffic chief said Tuesday.       Traffic division chief Randall Scott said the new signal at Charles and Oliver streets will remain green to northbound Charles Street traffic until a pedestrian pushes a button indicating a desire to cross. The new signal, which will be installed north of Mount Royal Avenue and south of the entrance ramp to Interstate 83, is expected to be in operation as early as February but no later than May, Scott said.

Developer sought for parcel north of Penn Station
By Edward Gunts, The Baltimore Sun | June 21, 2011
Three public groups are looking for a private-sector partner interested in building a transit-oriented development on a triangular parking lot just north of Penn Station.       Amtrak, which owns the 1.5-acre development parcel, has set Aug. 5 as the deadline for groups to submit qualifications to serve as the master developer for the property, which is bounded by Lanvale, St. Paul and Charles streets and the Amtrak train lines.       Amtrak issued the request along with the Maryland Department of Transportation and the City of Baltimore.

At Penn Station, the sign no longer goes clackety-clack
By Michael Dresser | michael.dresser@baltsun.com | March 22, 2010
It's a whole lot quieter in Penn Station these days - no whirring sounds, no clickety-clack of an old-fashioned, mechanical signboard bringing the news that your train is 20 minutes late.        In place of the iconic board above the main desk at Baltimore's Amtrak station, there now hangs a large digital board that works intermittently as it undergoes testing. For live information, passengers depend on two small temporary digital screens - miniature versions of what travelers might see listing arrivals and departures at an airport.

Amtrak contractor breaks gas main on Penn Station property
By Steve Kilar, The Baltimore Sun | December 29, 2011
Around 10 a.m. Thursday an Amtrak contractor struck a 24-inch gas main on the property of Penn Station in Baltimore, a utility spokeswoman said.      Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. responded to the scene and were continuing work on shutting off the gas line at around 2 p.m., said Rachael Lighty.      Only buildings on the Penn Station property are expected to lose gas service because of the leak, she said, but BGE is having employees canvass the area to ensure no residential gas users have lost service.

Penn Station Parking Crunch
October 15, 1990
With the Board of Estimates having given its blessings, design work on a new entrance plaza and underground parking garage at Pennsylvania Station can finally begin. When the much-talked about $15.2 million project is finished, it will provide a focal point for improvements taking place in the area of Mount Royal Avenue.The bad news is that the 550-garage is likely to be too small the day it opens because two nearby open-air lots will be closed. Meanwhile, Amtrak passenger volume is steadily increasing.

ATF sting nabs another group of would-be home invasion suspects
By Justin Fenton, The Baltimore Sun | February 6, 2012
They met three times at Penn Station to discuss the robbery of a cartel's drug stash house, then on Thursday, strapped with handguns, gathered at a 7-11 in Hampden for a last-minute rendezvous before carrying out the plot, according to court documents.      The whole operation was a ruse, however, set up by federal agents. It's at least the second time the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has used the method in recent months to identify and arrest home invasion suspects.

Amtrak Off the Track
By Kathy Hudsonhudmud@aol.com | January 31, 2012
When it comes to customer service, Amtrak is easily derailed.  My nephew gave me an Amtrak gift certificate for Christmas. I tried to use it on Sunday when making reservations for travel to New York.       First, I went online. Nothing relevant could I see on the computer screen.  I called the Amtrak 800 number. The friendly man said I had to go to the train station to use the gift certificate.       On Monday, I went to Penn Station. The man at the counter made the reservations, then said he thought he'd better check with his manager to be sure the certificate could be used at his terminal.

City building bike trail to connect Penn Station and Inner Harbor
By Candus Thomson, The Baltimore Sun | December 4, 2011
About 16 months from now, bicyclists will be able to ride from the Inner Harbor to Pennsylvania Station on a smooth path all their own.      Little by little, crews working in the shadow of the Jones Falls Expressway are inching their way north, building a concrete and belgian-block median to separate four-wheel traffic from the two-wheel variety.      The $3.5 million, state-funded segment of the Jones Falls Trail will start at Lee Street near the Baltimore Visitor Center, wrap around the Inner Harbor and follow the Fallsway to the train station.

Penn Station's architect designed terminals in Hoboken, Scranton

I repeated a blooper in my recent column on the 100th anniversary of Baltimore's Pennsylvania Station that was caught by a sharp-eyed Roland Park resident and lawyer, John C. Murphy, who comes from a family of Baltimore architects.      I had stated with the authority of numerous articles (some that appeared in this newspaper) that Kenneth Murchison, who had designed Baltimore's Pennsylvania Station, had been a member of the esteemed New York City architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White.

New parking garage at Penn Station opens today

Amtrak and commuter rail passengers and the countless drivers trapped in North Charles Street traffic over the past two years have reason to rejoice over today's opening of a $14 million parking garage at Pennsylvania Station.Seven months late and $1 million over budget, the tri-level facility features 550 parking spaces -- twice what has been available at the privately operated street-level lot north of the 84-year-old train depot at Charles and Lanvale streets.Not only is the garage expected to make parking more convenient, but the building's top level creates a plaza at the station's main entrance.

Aerial convoy at Penn Station was part of drill
BY A SUN STAFF WRITER | December 5, 2002
Rush-hour commuters were treated to an unusual display of aerial activity yesterday at Penn Station, where travelers reported seeing two roaring Black Hawk helicopters follow a high-speed Acela Express train.  The aerial convoy was sighted about 4:30 p.m. and was part of a military exercise, said Amtrak spokesman Dan Stessel. He would not provide details about it but said Amtrak periodically conducts drills with law enforcement agencies.  Maryland National Guard spokesman Maj. Charles Kohler, whose office is near Penn Station, said the helicopters were UH-60 Black Hawk aircraft.
