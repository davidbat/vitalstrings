Pictures of Penn Station in New York City and 30th Street Station in Philadelphia
For those that read my blog but have never been to Penn Station in New York City and 30th Street Station in Philadelphia I thought I'd include a couple photos of both. I found these on flickr.
Penn Station in New York City
7th Ave entrance to Penn Station:
These are the stairs that lead down from the 7th Ave entrance to Penn Station. Penn Station is in a basement basically. These are from the bottom of the stairs looking up. The on stair advertising is fairly new, been there for about 3 years I'd say. It was not there when I started my commute from Philly to NYC in 2004. There's a long hallway leading to these stairs from the train platforms so you get a good look at whatever ad is there.
Main Penn Station waiting area for Amtrak trains. Tracks are down the stairs which are to the left and right in this picture with the train announcement board in the middle of the picture
On the platform at Penn Station
30th Street Station
Shot of 3oth Street Station from the Center City side of the Schuylkill River (East of the Schuylkill River is Center City Philadelphia, West of the river is West Philly) with the Cira Center in the background. The Market Street bridge is in the foreground.

Most Phi to NYC trains boarded on Track #3, I got to know these stairs very well...
30th Street Station is quite a beautiful structure while Penn Station NYC, well, is not. They say the original Penn Station used to be quite nice before it was demolished in 1964 , here's a picture of the original:
This is shot of 8th Ave looking south with Penn Station on the left and the Farley Post Office on the right. New York wants to remodel the Farley Post Office and to make it into a new Penn Station.
