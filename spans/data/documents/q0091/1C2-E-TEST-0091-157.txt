New York was a town that had never been much obsessed with a sense of permanence and demolition crews were routinely reducing splendid old buildings to rubble when, in early 1962, Mayor Robert Wagner created the Landmarks Preservation Commission to protect "structures and areas of historic of esthetic importance."
But by then it was already too late to save Pennsylvania Station and many blamed Wagner for having been insufficiently attentive to the city's save-the-station activists as they protested the grand old lady's imminent demise.
The Pennsylvania Railroad had for years wanted this costly white elephant off its hands and now the Pennsy had signed an agreement with the people who were building a new Madison Square Garden and there was no longer anything to be done for Charles McKim's neoclassic masterwork, which began falling to the wrecking ball in October 1963.
SHAME, read the signs carried by the silent marchers as demolition began.
"In the years to come," mourned commission director James Van Derpool, "we will be consumed with regret for allowing this supreme example of the architecture of the period to be destroyed."
He was right.
Meanwhile, directly as a result of the Penn Station tragedy, the City Council soon undertook to pass legislation giving some measure of official standing to the landmarks board's recommendations.
But Penn Station's proud granite columns already lay in pieces in New Jersey's Secaucus Meadows, where they had been dumped as landfill.
