Amtrak: Baltimore Penn Station to get hotel -- baltimoresun.com
I am SOOOOO excited about this project. Station-North will be forever changed after this occurs. I am always shocked after getting off the train here in Baltimore after walking and spending time in the other great train stations on the east coast. I mean, is it so hard to at least wash the windows and straighten the shades on the upper floors?  I have written letters to the Sun about it and it has been a pet-peeve of mine for many years. Now, change will come and I look so forward to this development. We will be with the big boys after this. Plus, what an added stimulus for Station-North. This will bring the area into full-swing.
