A quiet Saturday afternoon was interrupted when the sound of tires screeching followed by a loud crash echoed through the station.  A two vehicle crash occurred at the corner of Manoa and Trent Roads, pushing one vehicle through a fence.  The rescue assignment was dispatched as the passenger side door to one of the vehicles could not be opened to asses the injured elderly occupants.  Rescue 21 went in service and quickly removed the door.  During the course of the incident size up, a fuel leak was detected.  It was quickly deduced that as a result of the collision, the one car ran over a street sign.  The metal post of the sign punctured the near full gas tank, spilling the contents.  With a protective hand line in place, crews began to contain the leak.  The company was in service for an hour and a half.
 
Penn Wynne Visits the Reading Phillies
Date:

Today members, their families and friends traveled northwest to the city of Reading to see the Double-A Reading Phillies take on the Binghamton Mets in an evening doubleheader matchup.  After losing the first game by a score of 3-4, the R-Phils rallied late in the second game to win in extra innings by a score of 5-4.  The night was filled with exciting baseball, good food and a great time.  We would like to thank the Highland Park Fire Company for sending a few of their members to stand by in our station, while we attended the game.

On Wednesday evening, members from Penn Wynne traveled to the Lower Merion Township Training Tower for our monthly burn drill.  Utilizing a tool often overlooked, firefighters from the company completed three different evolutions using pressurized water extinguishers.  Each evolution, taught and reminded members a different tactic for containing and extinguishing small room and content fires.  This weeks drill was an excellent review for our senior firefighters, as well as a great learning experience for the company's newer members who were amazed at the amount of fire one water can will extinguish.

Members traveled to the Public Safety Training Campus for a ceremony and dedication remembering two firefighters, one of them being township firefighter Tom Hays.  Tom passed away in December 2006 after operating at a fire in Wynnewood.  Tom started his career at the Merion Fire Company of Ardmore, then joined the Narberth Fire Company, and still loved the job and had enough time to join the Penn Wynne Fire Company.  Today we gathered to remember and honor their memory so no one forgets their sacrifice.

This morning firefighters from the Penn Wynne Fire Company attended a special ceremony at the Penn Wynne Elementary School with Ladder 21.  The students and staff participated in the Philadelphia 76ers “Read for Ronald” program and fundraiser during February, 2010.  As an incentive to read and to raise money for such a worthy cause, Mr. Bernatowicz, the school principal, agreed to spend a school day reading on the roof of the Penn Wynne School if the number of minutes read by everyone totaled more than 100,000 minutes.  The students and staff rose to the challenge and read for 145,495 minutes raising $6,651.00.  Accordingly, this morning Mr. B climbed to the roof with the asistance of a few of our firefighters as the students and staff watched and cheered him on.  Mr. B spent the day reading and greeting the students as they played on the field during recess.
 
EXTRA TRAINING ACQUIRED STRUCTURE DRILL
Date:
4.5.10
On Monday evening 6 members from Penn Wynne mounted Rescue 21 and headed to the 1200 block of Rock Creek Road, in the Gladwyne section of Lower Merion, to drill at an acquired structure slated for demolition.  Once on location, our crew teamed up with crews from the Merion Fire Company of Ardmore, Station 25, to perform multiple fire attack, search & rescue and roof ventilation evolutions.  Since these types of drills are few and far between, we wanted to take advantage of this type of training.  We would like to thank our neighbors to the north for allowing us to participate in this drill, and we look forward to working together at joint drills in the future!
 
FROM PENN WYNNE TO THE BIG APPLE
Date:
3.15 - 3.16
On Sunday evening, three members of the Penn Wynne Fire Company departed Lower Merion Township for the Big Apple for a two-day Fire Service Symposium.  Assistant Chief David Watrous, Engineer Chris Feder, and Firefighter Brad Remick attended the 2010 FDNY Special Operations Symposium held at the FDNY Fire Academy AKA “The Rock”.  This year’s symposium focused on procedures of the FDNY’s Special Operations Command. The conference was attended by over 400 professionals from across the country and around the world, including Australia, the Netherlands, Panama, Canada, France and of course Penn Wynne.  FDNY chiefs and company officers gave lectures on a variety of topics, such as hazardous materials operations, rescue company procedures, safety command guidelines, marine company operations and anti-terrorist command procedures. A special presentation also was given by Chief Joe Downey, who headed up the FDNY’s Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) team in Haiti.
Penn Wynne attendees absorbed a plethora of information, spoke with commanding officers and networked with other professionals from the fire service community.  There was a variety of manufactures on display showing off the latest and greatest tools in the public safety world.  Following the end of the days presentations, tours of the facility were offered to the brother and sisters who attended.  Penn Wynne members felt it was their duty to take the tour and bring back some ideas for training.
Little did we know that we would be touring a training academy like no other.  The training grounds included a full-scale city “mini” city with inside training facilities.  One of these facilities was called the field house.  FDNY members are able to drive in apparatus into the 6-story building, which has a cover and bay doors, and conduct full scale training evolutions.  Some of these evolutions include tower ladder operations, ground ladder evolutions, rappelling and high angle rescue, hose advancement, apparatus placement and a variety of other evolutions.  The grounds also included a full-scale subway platform with three actual subway cars.
The symposium was a great success and members are looking forward to next year’s topic.  A great thanks goes out to the FDNY Foundation for sponsoring this event and FDNY for hosting this symposium.  A great deal of information was passed on. The Fire Department of New York has learned a great deal since the September 11th attacks and we were happy to have been a part of absorbing this information and bringing it back to our Brothers and Sisters in Lower Merion.
God Bless
