This is one of the best Internet videos I’ve ever seen.
Are there any other details about it like who was behind it, how it was done etc.?

It’s done by Fyre UK, They have a youtube channel you can check out. Just search fyreuk. They have a few other time lapse vids and they show you around their awesome server. If you want to become a part of the server you have to donate though.
