They sound just like the Tallest Man on Earth after a night of serious partying! Like it!

Saw them live in Birmingham (UK) recently - the've got so much great material that they didn't even bother to play Penn Station.  Absolutely cracking live show.

Wonderful song... go see these guys live if you get a chance.  It's always a big rambling, sloppy, foot-stomping party -- especially in a bar.

You guys are fricking ace. Come back to the UK soon.
