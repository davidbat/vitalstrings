“ Parking at Newark Penn Station ”
Nov 08, 2007, 4:19 PM
We will stay at Sheraton Newark Airport hotel and want to visit NYC twice (once to Madison Square Garden and second to Chinatown)while we stay at the hotel. I was told that riding a train from Newark Penn Station to NY Penn Station (then subway for Chinatown) will be our bext bet. Now we have to think about how we are going to get to Newark Penn Station from the hotel. We will have a car, but does Penn Station have convenient parking lot? If we take a cab to Penn Station, how much would the fare be? Also if we come back late at night from NY, would it be a problem finding a cab to come back to our hotel?
Thank you in advance.
