Editorial Review
A major transit hub in midtown Manhattan, New York Penn Station serves commuters from Long Island and New Jersey as well as subway riders in New York City. It also provides intercity services through Amtrak. But the current Penn Station is but a poor underground shadow of its former self. The former Pennsylvania Station, built in 1910 and demolished in 1964, was one of New York's great architectural glories. Fortunately, its sister building, the grand General Post Office across the street, also designed by famed architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, will eventually become the new Moynihan Station .
