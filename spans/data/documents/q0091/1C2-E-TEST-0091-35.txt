It's a train station.
Never been in the bathrooms, so I cannot impart my wisdom on the cleanliness or overall enjoyment in using one of those stalls. However, NY Penn's bathrooms are the pits, so you may not want to hold it until then - great first experience in NY for those tourists, eh?
I have been to Newark Penn as a Raritan Valley commuter who had to change trains, and I have been to Newark Penn as my destination. Both are different experiences.
As a RV commuter.. it's a rough commute. You have to make a mad dash from your RV train to the next NJCL or NEC usually in 2 minutes flat. Men have no sense of chivalry, and people with baby strollers use their children as human shields. I think this is more of a problem for NJT, though, as I am still waiting for the answer to my letters, emails, and singing telegram as to why it cannot just make another stop to NY Penn.
As a destination to see the ex bf. It could be worse. The nice thing is that all trains stop at Newark Penn, so if you need to go there for some reason (a hockey game or just to sightsee in the ol Ironbound), it's not much more than a $5 ticket and a 20 min trip. Don't quote me if they have to stop for 'train traffic' (aka Amtrak slowin everyone up), however.
Some tips that have probably already been much more eloquently stated..
- The taxi line is outside by the main area (when you walk down, it's past Track 5). However, you may be able to get one of the cheaper Portuguese guys if you go out the entrance by Track 1.
- The RV trains are at Track 5 like someone said, and they typically get to the track between 15 & 17 min early. If you take this train, you know it's important to get on 17 min early to aim for one of the single seats (lest you have the gall to tell that woman to move her purse as she does not need a 2 seater by herself).
- All tracks are posted before the train comes, MUCH unlike NY Penn, so you never have to worry about that run to the correct track (don't you feel like a sheepdog should be leading you at NY Penn?)
- I prefer the Raymond Blvd exit for getting picked up (it's the stairway at the far side of the track, without having to go into the station) because it seems to be less busy and it lets you out at the side entrance. However, this closes after 8 and on weekends.
- Most of the Park & Ride lots are ridiculously expensive. There is a parking lot behind the Blue Cross garage that is $10 a day. Not cheap, but a better deal than having to pay what could be a month's rent at the other places.
- Lots of homeless outside.. 1 set of teeth between em, but they are pretty harmless.
