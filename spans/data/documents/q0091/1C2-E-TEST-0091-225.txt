Figures of Day and Night, including the 2 smaller eagles adjacent to         the figures, were for years located at Ringwood State Park in New         Jersey.
The NY TIMES pictured a "Figure of Day" in the New Jersey Meadowlands dump.         This DAY would account for the third figure known to exist.
The two previously known DAYS were in the statuary groups in Kansas City and Ringwood State Park, NJ (now at the NJT Newark Training         Facility) so it appears that all figures of DAY have been accounted for.         March 25, 1998 NY TIMES

NJT Training Facility Newark, NJ c.2002, NJT obtained the statuary and had it restored by Steve         Tatti. Since then, the statuary has languished outside of the NJT Training Facility building in Newark. Latest word is that the statuary might be placed at the new facility that NJT is planning at Penn Station.

During the mid 1960s, this eagle was donated to Cooper Union, and it was         only later learned that sculptor Adolph Weinman was an alumnus.         Originally it was placed on the grounds of the school's Green Campus in         Ringwood, New Jersey. It was later moved to a courtyard of the Manhattan         Campus and a few years ago, it was moved to one of the schools adjacent         building rooftops.

They got an eagle under the erroneous assumption that the "granite" was quarried in         Vinalhaven, Maine.
When it was later discovered that the "granite" was supposedly quarried in Milford, Mass., Vinalhaven decided to keep the eagle anyway and dedicate it to the local granite industry.
Much to their chagrin, the quarry stone is marble.

There are two at the US Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY.  A nearby plaque identifies the eagles as being carved from Pink Granite quarried in Milford, Mass.  Wrong, they are marble.
