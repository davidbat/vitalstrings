NEW YORK â€” Elected leaders and railroad officials are celebrating the 100th birthday of the original Penn Station as they begin the long-delayed expansion of the existing one.
The old Penn Station was completed in 1910 and was torn down in the mid-1960s.
New York officials gathered today in the rotunda of the existing Penn Station to celebrate the bittersweet anniversary of the former station with its vaulted ceilings evoking a grand cathedral.
U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler called the destruction of the station "a desecration."
Later today, officials planned to attend a groundbreaking for the expansion of Penn Station to the Farley Post Office across the street.
The expanded Penn Station will be known as Moynihan Station. The late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan pushed for it throughout the 1990s.
