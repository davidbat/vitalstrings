"Very good option . . ."
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
I was here for two events at the Prudential Center and another in Madison Square Garden. I usually drive into NYC but decided that it was time to pay respects to the current Mayoir of Newark, and all he does, and try staying there. This is a very good hotel. It is attached by walkways -- well-lighted and safe as can be -- to the intersection immediately […] beside the Prudential Center and to Newark Penn Station, where the NJ Transit trains are easily decipherable and will have you in NYC Penn Station in 18 minutes for five bucks each way. Parking was $21 a day under the hotel, but it was paid if you stayed at the Hilton. There was a very good bar/cafe just off the lobby, and although it was a bit pricey it was not out of the ordinary. Also in the walkway shoppes were a Starbucks, Subway, a full deli, gift shop, sports club, newsstand, and several other businesses. It was all very convenient.Trying to find a complaint isn't easy. I did notice that the walls and doors are thin, but no one seems to notice because the guests are all polite. The staff was exceedingly helpful. This is a great place to stay if you want to avoid the downtown NYC prices. It is also a great spot ifyou are driving from the west, as I did, because you can depart without having to fight through the Hudson tunnels or the GW Bridge. Read more

"Great Location for AmTrak, PATH, and NJ Transit"
Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
The Newark Penn Station location is excellent if you want quick and easy access to AmTrak, PATH (World Trade Center), and NJ Transit (New York Penn Station). That said the hotel is showing it's age, and the it was quite noisy (hallway noise). We had a few issues, but the staff were very nice and worked to resolve them as quickly as possible. The neighborhood […] doesn't seem the best, but we didn't have any trouble with the directly connected skybridge (even more run down), and sadly the shops mainly catered to a work week schedule.

Decided to stay here knowing my family was just sleeping here. We didn't want to drive into the city. That worked out as expected. Trains were always crowded no matter what time. The biggest surprise was there are no restaurants to really go to around the immediate area. The outside area is too dangerous to walk around. Bottom line, hotel staff really […] great. Location awful. Convenient access to trains.  I would spend more money next time and stay in a better place. Read more

I stay at this hotel every time I come to NYC/NJ area. To go to NYC, all we have to do is hop on to the NJ Path, which is at the cross from the Hotel. Price is less than half of what we'll pay in manhattan for same star rating. Hilton Newark Penn Hotel is very clean and staff are VERY nice and even go out of their way to help you.  We usually drive, […] so it is great that they have parking lot right next to it. With one flat fee, we can take car in and out all day. Very convenient.

"Avoid NYC parking. Stay here."
Reviewed by Stephen M of Maryland
This hotel meets expectations brought to mind by the name Hilton. Parking is free with hotel validation. The concourse from the Hilton to Newark Penn Station protects from the weather, etc. The Path Train to Manhattan could not be simpler, more affordable or convenient. The commute is not insignificant but for the lesser price, worth it.

Reviewed by a Hotels.com guest
I had to pay for internet access in my room, very disappointing. Cheaper hotels and even motels in developing countries have complimentary Internet access. I also had to pay for parking, very disgusting. I won't recommend this hotel at all.
We do apologize about the charges for services for the hotel, such as the internet and the parking. We are unable to control these expenses as the garage we have is not managed or owned by our property and the internet is through a third party provider as well. We know that this is not any means a way to satisfy the inconvenience you encountered, but please let us know if there's anything further we can do to have you stay with us again.

Reviewed by Robert P of Houston, Texas
I stayed three nights in a double room on the third floor of this hotel. Upon exiting the elevator I was greeted with what smelled like a stale, dirty carpet; the alir was thick and stuffy and the hallway was dimly lighted. Although the front desk clerk assured me that my room was not near the elevator, or stairwell, I found it to be away from the elevator, […] but almost directly accross fron the stairwell. The room was clean, but smelled the same as the hallway; except that the hallway had been spayed with a frangrance that I assumed was to mask the dank smell. I also found that the plumbing connections on the toilet had a slow leak. The room was also noticebly dusty and on the inside face of the bathroom door.there was a thin film of soap scum punctuated by fingerprints smudges. The towels appeared dingy and the very rough to the skin. The heating system was weak and irritated my eyes and sinuses. Upon closer inspection I noticed a heavy dust build-up on the register and the intake vents appeared dirty. The room had definite air cirulation problem; Although the windows were designed to open, there was no way to open them without a key. The bedding was suspect and the white comforter was dingy; The head of the beds were lower than the foot and the covers were dusty. I stayed here twice before, but never on the third floor. I spent three restly nights this time. If you are sensitive to dirty carpet, dusk or poor fresh- air circulation you might want to avoid the third floor.; It's not worth the money. Read more
