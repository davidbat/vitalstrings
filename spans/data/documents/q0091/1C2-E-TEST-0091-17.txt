Penn Station
Penn Station
Baltimore's Penn Station sit over the Pennsylvania Railroad's former mainline through Maryland, now part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. MARC and Amtrak share the platforms here, with daily service to Baltimore Washington International Airport and Washington D.C.'s Union Station. MARC trains are stored here at night and over weekends, but it is rather difficult to view them without taking a train. Only passengers are allowed down the steps from the waiting room, and visibility from outside the station is limited by fences lining the bridges and streets overhead. The trains are visible from nearby I83, the Jones Falls Expressway, but there is no place to stop along this highway. It would be best to snap photographs while commuting between Baltimore and D.C.
AEM-7s were once very common at Penn Station, operated by both MARC and Amtrak. Since the delivery of the new GP40WH-2s, MARC AEM-7s are rarely, if ever, seen pulling the commuter trains. Amtrak still continues to use them, with an occasional E60 making an appearance. UPDATE: I spotted a MARC AEM-7 from I83 on Saturday, 27 July, sitting idle at the head of a commuter train. They appear to be still in use, but are hard to find since only four are on the MARC roster.
The recent renovation of Penn Station included adding a new parking garage, which will make a trip here much more convenient. The MTA is also adding an extension to its Light Rail line between the Mount Royal Station and Penn Station. The bridge across the JFX is in place and track and catenary has been installed on the concrete ramp leading under the station terminal. When completed, this extension will allow passengers to take the Light Rail between Penn Station and Camden Yards. This may be helpful for Oriole fans in the D.C. area, following the recent cancelation of MARC Oriole game service to Camden Station.
