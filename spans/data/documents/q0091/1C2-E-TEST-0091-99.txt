As a special thank you to its local customers and neighbors, Penn Station East Coast Subs is offering a free small order of its fresh-cut fries to anyone who dines in their restaurants on Wednesday, August 17. Penn Station’s fries are a customer favorite – hand-cut from unpeeled potatoes, which are then flash-fried in cholesterol-free peanut oil.
“Penn Station’s core customer base is fiercely loyal, especially when it comes to our fresh-cut fries,” says Craig Dunaway, president of Penn Station, Inc. “Our fresh-cut fries certainly have a high degree of crave appeal, along with our other menu items like our fresh-baked chocolate chunk cookies.”
Penn Station is renowned for its legendary Philadelphia Cheesesteak Sub sandwich served hot on French bread, hand-cut fries made to order, and fresh-squeezed lemonade made in the restaurant several times daily. 
In addition to its signature Philadelphia Cheesesteak Sub, Penn Station also offers other hot-grilled to order sandwiches such as Chicken Cordon Bleu, Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken Parmesan, Pizza, Italian, Club, Reuben, Vegetarian, and a fresh-grilled Artichoke Sub that is unique to Penn Station. The menu also features Chicken Salad and Tuna Sub Sandwiches and a kid’s meal.
