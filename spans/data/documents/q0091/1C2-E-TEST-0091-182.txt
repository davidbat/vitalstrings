About Penn Station, New York
Penn Station, or Pennsylvania Station is a major        commuter rail hub and the major intercity train station        in New York, USA. It is connected to the New York City        Subway through several lines and it is one of the        busiest rail stations in the world. The station is        situated in Midtown Manhattan, at underground levels of        Pennsylvania Plaza, and owned by the National Railroad        Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). There are three        operators: NJ Transit, Amtrak and LIRR. In 2010 Penn        Station had 8.4 million passengers which made it the        busiest train station in North America.
The original building of Penn Station, covering 8 acres,        was designed by McKim, Mead and White and finished in        1910; it represented one of the architectural        masterpieces of New York City. The pink granite, the        Doric columns and the enormous waiting room inspired by        the Roman Baths of Caracalla made it a breathtaking        monument of NYC.
Sadly, the air rights optioned in the 1950s called for        the demolition of the train shed and head-house which        were replaced by a sports complex and an office complex.        The demolition started in 1963, while the underground        track remained untouched.
In the 1990s the train station was renovated to improve        the waiting and concession areas appearance and upgrade        the station information systems. A four-sided clock and        some mural elements recall the old Penn Station’s        architecture. In 2010 a new renovation was started which        implies major infrastructure improvements.
