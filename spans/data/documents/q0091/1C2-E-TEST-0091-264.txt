Choose from these models if you would prefer an uncompressed 3dmf file, or if you have trouble decompressing a file provided above for Windows or Macintosh.   Because they are uncompressed, neutral 3dmf files will take much longer to download.  However, if you set your Windows or Macintosh web browser to use DesignWorkshop as the helper application for ".3dmf" files, then these files will open directly into DesignWorkshop when downloaded.

Notes
A massing model is a very simple, exterior-only type of architectural 3D model, used to study    the essence of the overall 3D form and proportions of an architectural design.   Great Buildings Massing Models
A spatial model is an architectural 3D model with an intermediate level of detail, usually   including some of both the interior and exterior of the structure.  The spatial model may not   be fully realistic, but it usually allows interior as well as exterior walkthroughs.   Great Buildings Spatial Models
A detailed model is a relatively complete interior/exterior architectural 3D model, used to view    an architectural design relatively realistically.  A detailed model often includes material textures, and even   details like furniture and major ornamental elements.   Great Buildings Detailed Models
