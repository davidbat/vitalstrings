Location very convenient to event. Staff also quite friendly.
Room was clean enough, but common areas looked a little run down. Price was quite high for a hotel of this level.
I came into town for the evening for an event, and found the pickings in Downtown Newark pretty slim. Nonetheless, the Hilton was right by the train station and, although pricey on this particular day, I decided to stay. Hotel facility itself was fine.

I like the fact that we used our card key in the elevator, it shows a level of extra security.
I didn't see an elevator on the street level, we had to take luggage up the escalator.
Nice for a one night stay. Didn't like not being able to use the 1st level of the parking deck, the cards didn't work on the parking gates when we were leaving and it took the man in the office over 5 min to get us out of the parking deck. Five minutes is a long time to be waiting at a parking gate.

The bed is comfortable.
Parking fee and there is nothing much to eat nearby.
I required "free parking" when I bid the price. However when we reached the hotel, we were told that parking fee is additional. And no breakfast included. The location is a bit weird if you drive instead of using Newark Transit service. The room is clean and of good size. And the bed is really firm and comfortable.
