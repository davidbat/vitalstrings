Breakfast Near Penn Station
My idiot travel agent and friend booked us on Amtrak to New York that leave Baltimore at 5:52 a.m. for a cruise that you can't begin boarding until Noon.  Where can we have breakfast near Penn Station.  We will be dragging luggage, so do not want to drag it too far.  Thanks.

If you want to have Korean for breakfast, most of the places from 32nd to 36th between Broadway/6th and 5th are open 24 hours. You can even get savory pancakes there - hyaemul pa-jun (seafood pancakes) or kimchi pa-jun (kimchi pancakes). Most any Korean restaurant will have those on the menu.
