Gimbels Passageway Btwn Herald Square and Penn Station
There's been talk for years now that a semi-forgotten underground passageway between Herald Square and Penn Station would be reopened. And while there's still nothing guaranteed, a few more details about the plan have emerged. The 800-foot pedestrian concourse, which was closed in the early '80s because of crime, is only nine feet wide at some points, and currently dilapidated. (Called Gimbels Passageway, it's named for the old Gimbels department store that closed in 1986, which was replaced by Manhattan Mall.) Now the Post reports that Vornado Realty Trust is still seeking permission to reopen the passage, expanding the narrowest section to 16 feet and filling it with retail shops and art, in the style of Rockefeller Center.
