Pennsylvania Station
Newark, NJ
Art Deco and Streamlined come together to make Newark's Penn Station a masterpiece.  The marbled walls of the waiting room sport logos dedicated to the transport of their times and earlier.  A stylized Viking ship, stylized steam and electric engines and an old propeller airplane are among icons in this bright temple of transportation.  NJ Transit has restored the station to some of its former glory.
