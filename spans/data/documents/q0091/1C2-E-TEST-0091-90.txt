Disgusting and depressing, cramped and uncomfortable. The bowels of hell. Urine soaked. Difficult to navigate.

My partner and I I took the 7:15 pm train from Penn Station to Albany yesterday.  The Broadway matinee we’d seen ended at 4:30, so we had to decide where to spend those couple of hours.  Had it been Grand Central, no contest: we would wait at the station.  But Penn Station?  Sitting in the soulless Amtrak waiting area?  You’re right in saying it is space not worthy of NYC.  We took a walk around Hell’s Kitchen, and then resigned ourselves to the dinginess of the waiting room.  I like where Penn Station is, in the heart of NYC, not too far from any of the places I like to go in the city.  That’s about it.

It has taken me years — years — to figure out the exits at Penn Station.  When my train arrives, it is a matter of luck that I ever find my way to the main concourse.  Dreary, low-ceilinged, no place to sit except that fenced-off area. — What an introduction to NYC.  I really miss Grand Central Station, where the upstate trains used to arrive, and the excitement of reaching that glorious room, which symbolized the glories of the city.

When will the whole structure including the platform, the stairs, etc be really throughly cleaned?
For the 200th birthday?
Also when will the Station become a real high speed train station and not only for very slow trains? Also in 100 Years?
There is not much to celebrate because the future for the rail system in the USA is gloom and dark.

New York….a city to be proud of.  And what do you encounter when you arrive?  JFK, LGA and Penn Station.  It’s truly embarrassing, just humiliating.

Saving that grand post office building by turning it into the entrance for Penn Station never made any sense for Penn Station.  All it did was save the main post office building.  But #1 pliny is right – nobody’s going to ever go UP all those steps to get DOWN to the railroad tracks.
Even bigger question:  what did D.P. Moynihan ever do for New York to earn having Penn Station renamed in his honor.   He did next to nothing for New York.  His reputation is based on his academic work, not on what he did in the Senate.  In the Senate he was always a bit of a flake.   He’s a city boy, but not a New York hero.
Maybe it all fits.  Dumb idea named after flakey politician.

A plaque is always bestowed upon those who create great public works – In the case of Penn Station’s destruction I believe a plaque should be erected to those who voted to knock-it-down – as a lesson to those who choose to destroy for the sake of progress – perhaps in our next lives we will not be so foolish….perhaps a plaque to Sheldon Silver over on the rail yards where the Jets should be playing and one for that kncukle-headed Governor of NJ where the rail-tunnel should be

I enter and leave New York through Penn Station on a regular basis. It’s futile to complain about the crowds in NYC, I know, but the sheer volume of people, tourists included, who are in and around Penn Station lends itself to a vaguely organized chaos. I often feel like a rat in a maze rather than a civilized human being on my way to work. More benches to sit on would be helpful, as would a better organized space. I bet NYC could learn something from the train stations in Europe too.
And then I wonder how the entire lot of midtown would be if we could remove the tourists!

I barely remember the old Penn Station.  The current Penn Sta is a disaster–confusing, crowded, ugly, disorganized.  It is a travesty.  It is a monument to greed.

The new station will also move further away from the subways that service the commuters. What urban planning idiot thinks this is a good idea?

1. Redesign the main NJ Transit waiting area with much wider access doors to the train platforms, making it possible to get home without being crushed of a mob of morons pushing to squeeze into a small entrance way. Better yet, put up signs advertising that it’s permissible to punch someone trying to force their way in front of you.
2. Employ all of those soldiers, NYPD members, and plainclothes operatives standing around uselessly waiting for a terrorist attack to herd the masses, at gunpoint, into neat lines of people moving courteously through the station instead of allowing them to remain the charging, aggressive animals that they are now.

I just can’t believe that in 2010 we don’t have a better system than to crowd in front of a big sign, wait anxiously until they tell us what track we’re on, and then push each other around to get to our train.

I was 10 when the original was destroyed, so I cannot compare.  I don’t take Metro North, so I can’t compare with Grand Central.  All I know is that the LIRR concourse is a crowded, dark, dull, soul-numbing experience.

Always enjoyed a slice at Don Pepi’s, but since my college days going through Penn Station has been depressing, from its bad lighting to its grime and inconvenience.  I hope in my lifetime I get to see a new station, but not holding my breath.

Penn Station is old ,outdated and antiquated. The train system in this country is too. We have a lot of improvements to make it a world class system.

Every time I walk through that subterranean thing, that space wherein not a photon of sunlight ever exposes itself, I curse (inwardly) the politicians who lined their pockets with the graft accrued to them from tearing down the real Penn Station, and replacing it with that temple of the crude: MSG. Nothing will assuage my anger than reversing the process: tearing down MSG and rebuilding the greco/roman edifice that once stood elegantly their.

I remember the station in its original neo-Classical style– an imposing structure and a grand space. After its defenestration, it became a depressing warren and, for an infrequent user, confusing to the point of bewilderment. New Yorkers may be nonplussed by it. Several years ago I was trying to find my way through its mazes and came upon two men with boa constrictors draped around their shoulders. No one else paid any attention to them–just another day in Penn Station, still named for a long defunct railway.

The fix for Penn Station is simple.
1. Enough dynamite to wipe out the existing house of horrors. All of it.
2. Rebuild with an exact copy of the original Penn Station, enlarged for today’s and future expanded needs.
If it can be done with the hand tools and horses of 1910 it can certainly be done today.
Anything else is a further waste.
…..for good measure, locate whoever was behind the demolition and secure them in the current station as it’s being imploded.  Destroying the perfectly functioning station wasn’t development, it was vandalism.

I’ve been commuting through Penn Station for the better part of 20 years. Main complaints, coming from NJ: not enough staircases going down to the train tracks, hideously ugly waiting rooms, both at the Amtrak end and at the NJ Transit end, not a single store you’d want to actually visit anywhere from LIRR to NJT to Amtrak areas. Plus claustrophobia-inducing low ceilings in the sublevel waiting areas. I would hate to have to get out of a crowded rush-hour Penn Station quickly in the event of an emergency.

As a frequent traveller to Manhattan, I cannot imagine a stronger contrast than the experiences one encounters at Penn Station and at Grand Central.  Grand Central sets a tone that is everything New York has been and wants to be–and Penn Station is, to put it bluntly, a pit.  Dirty, crowded. stuffy, confusing, poorly designed–and completly outshone by the Amtrak stations in Boston, New Haven, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.

May I add a disgrace, we will never live down the masterpiece we so stupidly destroyed in 1963.
Just review photographs which documented its stunning beauty….

Being underground would be disorienting enough, but Penn Station’s symmetrical layout means that visitors approaching from the north and south entrances have almost exactly the same experience upon arriving at the center. An overhauled redesign of the signage and wayfinding system would go a long way, and could include color-coding the walls in each quadrant (N, S, E, and W) to better help underground travelers orient themselves and find their ways in and out as quickly as possible.
