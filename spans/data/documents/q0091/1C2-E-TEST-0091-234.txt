Thanks.
I've never seen one. What exactly are you looking for? Where the Amtrak gates are is just one small part of the station - it's kind of a maze of walkways, with lots of shops and stuff. There aren't that many vendors, though that I can think of - lots of storefronts. There are bagel places, delis, fast food places, a TGI Friday's, bookstores, newstands, K-Mart, I think a Duane Reade, Staples, a few tourist souvenir places, a really great socks/tights shop, etc. With the layover you have, you shouldn't have any problem exploring. In fact, you'll want to because there is nowhere to sit (aside from the floor) in the main Amtrak concourse.
What did you find that shows the layout of the first floor? I just did a quick search and didn't come up with anything, so I'm curious.
