Penn Station's Ever-Expanding Boundaries in Midtown West
The first Pennsylvania Station opened in 1910 and faced Seventh  Avenue between 31st and 33rd streets. Soon after, Manhattan's General Post Office (now known as the Farley Post Office, but which may soon be developed into Penn Station’s new digs as the Moynihan Station ) opened behind the station on Eighth Avenue. To the west of the post office is the West Side Yard, a vast commuter rail storage station and maintenance station for the Long   Island Rail Road. However, in the fall of 2012, the Yard will undergo construction into a mega-development project by the Related Companies called  Hudson Yards , which will bring approximately 12 million square feet of Class A office space, residential, hotel, retail, and cultural uses in addition to the number 7 subway line extension.
