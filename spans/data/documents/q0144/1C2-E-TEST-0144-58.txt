Within the United States,                  the West (and specifically California) are major producers of                  Geothermal Energy. Each state has different regulations on geothermal                  energy. According to the Bureau                  of Land Management in California , , "The Geothermal Steam                  Act of 1970, as amended, (84 Stat, 1566; 30 U.S.C. 1001-1025)                  provides the Secretary of the Interior with the authority to lease                  public lands and other federal lands, including National Forest                  lands, for geothermal exploration and development in an environmentally                  sound manner. This authority has been delegated to the Bureau                  of Land Management (BLM). BLM implements the Act through the regulations                  contained in 43 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 3200." The table below shows the amount of money, leases and megawatts                  produced in California during the Fiscal                  Year 2000 (October 1, 1999-September 30, 2000).
Types                  of Geothermal Power Plants
Geothermal                technology has three varied ways of taking geothermal energy and                turning it in to useable energy for humans to use. The most common                systems are steam and binary power plants. There are two different                types of steam power plants: dry steam and flash steam. The following                definitions and pictures are from Geothermal                Technologies Program or Godfrey Boyle in Renewable Energy:                Power for a Sustainable Future.
Dry                Steam Power Plants or Hot Dry Rock Power Plants
Vapor dominated resources                where steam production is not contaminated
Steam                is 1050°F - 1220° F
Steam passes through                turbine
Blades and shaft rotate                and generate power
Cooling towers generate                waste heat
Most common and most                commercially attractive (Godfrey Boyle)
Used in areas where                geysers do not exist
Need water to inject down into rock
Well is deep
Takes more time to                inject water in well
 
Binary cycle                power plant
Uses lower-temperatures,                but much more common, hot water resources (100° F – 300° F).
Hot                water is passed through a heat exchanger in conjunction with a secondary                (hence, "binary plant") fluid with a lower boiling point                (usually a hydrocarbon such as isobutane or isopentane).
Secondary fluid vaporizes,                which turns the turbines, which drive the generators.
Remaining secondary                fluid is simply recycled through the heat exchanger.
Geothermal fluid is                condensed and returned to the reservoir.
Binary plants use                a self-contained cycle, nothing is emitted.
Energy produced by                binary plants currently costs about 5 to 8 cents per kWh.
Lower-temperature                reservoirs are far more common, which makes binary plants more prevalent.
Flash or Steam                plants
Use                very hot (more than 300° F) steam and hot water resources (as                found at The Geysers plants in northern California)
Steam                either comes directly from the resource, or the very hot, high-pressure                water is depressurized ("flashed") to produce steam.
Steam then turns turbines,                which drive generators that generate electricity.
Only significant emission                from these plants is steam (water vapor).
Minute amounts of carbon                dioxide, nitric oxide, and sulfur are emitted, but almost 50 times                less than at traditional, fossil-fuel power plants.
Energy produced this                way currently costs about 4-6 cents per kWh.
