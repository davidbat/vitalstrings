Geothermal Renewable Energy
Why Choose Geothermal?
Geothermal Energy Savings… Heating and cooling your home accounts for over 50% of your utility bills and water heating is another 15%. Geothermal energy is up to 500% efficient! That means, for every one unit of electricity that you use, you get up to five units back. Plus it even heats your water for FREE during the summer. A traditional system can’t do that! Thanks to the energy efficiency of a geothermal system, your investment can be returned to you in savings in as a little of 5-10 years, depending upon the efficiency of the system that is being replaced! As a matter of fact, you can save up to $25,000 in energy costs in just 10 years! Plus, geothermal energy qualifies for an UNLIMITED federal tax credit of 30% of the purchase price. You may also qualify for up to a $1,000 utility rebate and a $1,000 Energy Star Rebate, available until state funds are gone.
