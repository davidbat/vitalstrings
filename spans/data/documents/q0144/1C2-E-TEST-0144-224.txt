The New Mexico Geothermal Ground-Coupled Heat Pump Tax Credit will pay up to 30%, with a $9,000 maximum, of your geothermal ground-coupled heat pump system that is operational subsequent to January 1, 2010. This incentive is available for both personal and corporate income taxes for purchase and installation costs for these systems. In addition to this state tax credit, the federal government will pay 30% in a federal tax credit (Personal) or 10% (Corporate) for your geothermal ground-coupled heat pump system. New Mexico's incentive was passed by the legislature in 2009 to help citizens invest in clean energy for their homes or businesses.
