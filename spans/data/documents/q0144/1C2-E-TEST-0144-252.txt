It should also be noted that geothermal wells are drilled with the same equipment as oil and gas wells, and drilling is a large part of geothermal project costs. For this reason, geothermal project costs will tend to increase with high fossil energy prices, due to heightened demand for drilling equipment.
Geothermal projects are typically developed in four phases: Identification, Exploration, Drilling, and Production. The time frame of each of these steps is such that about three years pass before any electricity is produced, and between $40 million and $60 million has been spent for a typical 50-MW plant.
10
Of these costs, drilling accounts for between $35 million and $50 million. Most, if not all, capital prior to the development's proven feasibility is financed through equity and not debt. Due to the high risk at the early stages of the process, banks generally do not fund development with loans at phases prior to drilling. Therefore, the initial investment money comes from seed capital, venture capital, or equity financing.

This gap between available financing and required financing for a developer creates a substantial barrier to entry that explains in part why geothermal energy accounts for such a small share of global energy use, in spite of apparently favorable economics (if one only looks at levelized cost of energy, for example). How the investment environment might change in the future will be a key determinant of global geothermal energy production.

Advantages
Geothermal energy produces reliable (i.e. not intermittent) baseload renewable electricity. While there are some CO2 emissions from non-binary geothermal systems, the emissions are far lower than any fossil-based electric power technology. The CO2 emissions intensity of geothermal electricity, 0.18 lb CO2 per kWh, is about 17% of the average emissions intensity of the existing stock of gas power plants in the USA.
12
Binary geothermal systems have almost no CO2 emissions as the system is closed.
Geothermal heat pumps may be installed nearly anywhere; they do not require nearby hydrothermal activity. While capital costs are higher than standard furnaces, the present-day technologies may deliver a payback in as little as 3-5 years.
13
Geothermal may also serve as a key source of power in many developing nations. Kenya , for example, produces much of its electricity from geothermal resources, and in the future may be able to meet all of its electricity demand with only geothermal and hydroelectricity. Also of note, 10 of the 15 countries with the highest shares of geothermal energy (per national electricity production) are developing nations, including El Salvador , the Philippines , Nicaragua , Indonesia and Guatemala .
Thus, geothermal may allow some developing countries to supply a large amount of their future electricity demand through a clean, renewable resource.
Disadvantages
There are two main limitations on geothermal energy: siting and financing (for research and project deployment). As with all renewable energy sources, the energy is produced where it is found, regardless of whether it is used for generating electricity or direct applications. For this reason, using currently commercialized technologies, geothermal projects can only exist in regions with abundant geothermal resources, generally areas with recent tectonic activity.
Financing is a difficult challenge for geothermal; part of the reason why projects cannot get loans in the early stages is that, in fact, there is a high probability of failure in the first few years of a proposed geothermal project.
The high failure rates stem from uncertainties in the conditions that will determine the ultimate economic feasibility of projects. Slight differences in water temperature 2-3km below the surface can mean large differences in costs of energy extraction.
Future Development

; the key question regarding future development of geothermal resources will be whether any technologies allow cost-effective deployment. One set of technologies that appears somewhat promising is producing geothermal energy from active oil and gas wells, known as coproduction. While this technology may offer a resource comparable in potential magnitude to traditional hydrothermal sources and at lower costs
