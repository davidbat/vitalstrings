Exploring Ways to Use Geothermal Energy
The Earth's heat, which constantly flows outward from its core, provides an enormous source of energy called geothermal energy.
If you live in the western United States, you may have the opportunity now or in the future to buy clean electricity from a geothermal power plant .
Also, if you happen to live in an area that has access to a geothermal reservoir of low-to-moderate temperature (68ºF–302ºF) water, you can tap into it for a direct use application . Direct use applications include home heating, greenhouse heating, district heating, and fish farming.
You may have also heard of using a geothermal or ground-source heat pump to heat and cool your home. This energy-saving technology uses the constant temperature just below the earth's surface to help keep your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer, saving you money while maintaining a comfortable temperature.
