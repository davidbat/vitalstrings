Iowa Geothermal Association
 
The Iowa Geothermal Association is a non-profit Iowa trade  association formed in 1992 to advance the use of geothermal heating and cooling  within Iowa and the Midwest. The Association is comprised of geothermal  contractors, equipment manufacturers, design engineers, architects, utilities  and others dedicated to the promotion and growth of Iowa’s geothermal heating  and cooling industry.
Geothermal heating and cooling is a proven, extremely  reliable method of delivering energy efficient, environmentally friendly  heating and cooling to homes and businesses. Geothermal systems work by taking  advantage of the earth’s constant year-round ground temperature to provide  heating, cooling and hot water in both new construction and remodeling.
IGA has a long history of encouraging ethical business practices by all of its  members combined with consumer and contractor education. The IGA is a reputable  source of information for anyone interested in geothermal heating and cooling  systems and encourages its members to become IGSHPA Certified .
