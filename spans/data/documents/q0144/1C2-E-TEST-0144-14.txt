GEOTHERMAL         ENERGY
 
 
Geothermal                                 energy is a proven resource for direct heat and                                 power generation. In over 30 countries                                 geothermal resources provide directly used heat                                 capacity of 12,000 MW and electric power                                 generation capacity of over 8,000 MW. It meets a                                 significant portion of the electrical power                                 demand in several developing countries. For                                 example, in the Philippines geothermal provides                                 27% of that country's total electrical                                 generation, from power plant complexes as large                                 as 700 MW.
 
Individual                                 geothermal power plants can be as small as 100                                 kW or as large as 100 MW depending on the energy                                 resource and power demand. The technology is                                 suitable for rural electrification and mini-grid                                 applications in addition to national grid                                 applications. Direct use of geothermal heat can                                 boost agricultural and aqua-culture production                                 in colder climates and supply heat for                                 industrial processes that can add value to local                                 primary products. Geothermal resources may be                                 especially important and significant in                                 developing nations where no indigeneous fossil                                 fuel resources exist such as oil, coal or                                 natural gas. For example in Tibet, where no                                 readily available fossil fuels exist, the Nagqu                                 geothermal field (Tibet Autonomous Region, PRC)                                 provides a useful energy source for the local                                 population. With the help of the UN, a 1 MWe                                 binary plant was built in 1993.
 
Costs                                 of geothermal electric power are very dependent                                 on the character of the resource and project                                 size. The unit costs of power currently range                                 from 2.5 to over 10 US cents per kilowatt-hour                                 while steams costs may be as low as US$3.5 per                                 tonne. Major factors affecting cost are the                                 depth and temperature of the resource, well                                 productivity, environmental compliance, project                                 infrastructure and economic factors such as the                                 scale of development, and project financing                                 costs.
 
I.                                 Geothermal Resources
 
Geothermal                                 means "Heat from the Earth". The heat                                 that flows from the Earth's hot interior due to                                 crustal plate movements, zones of high heat flow                                 may be located close to the surface where                                 convective circulation plays a signifcant role                                 in bringing the heat close to the surface.
 
 
 
Deep                                 circulation of groundwater along fracture zones                                 will bring heat to shallower levels, collecting                                 the heatflow from a broad area and concentrating                                 it into shallow reservoirs or discharging as hot                                 springs. These reservoirs may contain hot water                                 and/or stream. By drilling into these                                 reservoirs, the hot water and/or steam is piped                                 to the surface where it is used for direct use                                 applications, or the high pressure steam is                                 separated to drive turbines for power                                 generation. The low energy waste water form such                                 power generaiton is then usually re-injected                                 back into the reservoir, or further utilised for                                 direct heat applications. This technology                                 enables it to be utilised to generate                                 electricity and provide domestic and industrial                                 heat. Geothermal energy has proved to be                                 reliable, economic, environmentally friendly and                                 renewable.
 
In                                 general there are two main categories, the high                                 temperature resources and the moderate/low                                 temperature resources. The high temperature                                 geothermal resources - 220 degrees Celsius and up - are predominantly found in volcanic regions                                 and island chains. The moderate to low                                 temperature resources are found on all                                 continents. The high temperature are almost                                 always used for power production while most of                                 the low temperature resources are used for                                 direct heating purposes or agriculture and                                 aquaculture.
 
II.                                 Resource Evaluation and Risk Assessment
 
Geothermal                                 projects typically progress through stages of                                 reconnaissance, exploration and development with                                 various decision points along the way. In the                                 early exploration stage when there are                                 uncertainties of finding a useable heat resource                                 after expending effort on early reconnaissance,                                 surface exploration and/or drilling exploration                                 wells. Carefully implemented regional                                 reconnaissance surveys can, however, lead to a                                 sound prioritisation of target areas by the                                 filtering out of less promising prospects. Good                                 exploration surveys of targeted prospect areas                                 have shown they deliver high success rates for                                 exploration drilling. Examples of such                                 successful programmes include those undertaken                                 in Indonesia, New Zealand and the Philippines                                 where exploration drilling achieved success                                 rates of over 80%.
 
III.                                 Applications
 
The                                 range of potential methods for utilising any                                 geothermal resource is very dependent on the                                 temperature of the resource.
 
Direct Uses of Geothermal Heat
Lower temperature geothermal resources are found                                 in many regions of the World. They can provide                                 useful energy for heating buildings and                                 agricultural and industrial processes. Such heat                                 can also be available as a by-product of                                 geothermal power generation projects that use                                 higher temperature resources. Some greenhouses                                 in the central region of Algeria are reported to                                 be using 60°C geothermal water for heating. In                                 China most of their geothermal use (of an                                 estimated 181 fields) has been for space                                 heating, agriculture, aquaculture, balneology                                 and medicinal purposes. Romania has a total of                                 130 MWt installed thermal capacity for direct                                 uses, which are: district heating for about 3000                                 dwellings, 47 ha of greenhouses, sanitary hot                                 water for 16000 dwellings, preparation of                                 industrial hot water for about 10 factories and                                 balneological uses.
 
Space/District                                 Heating.
Schemes utilising geothermal heat provide over                                 80% of the central heating needs of Reykjavik                                 city in Iceland and are employed in many towns                                 in USA, Poland and Hungary. The World Bank is                                 currently supporting a program in Poland for                                 using hot water from unsuccessful oil wells to                                 displace the use of coal for district heating.
Heat pump technology utilising the earth as a                                 heat source and sink to provide central heating                                 in winter and cooling in summer. In many                                 countries such heating or cooling may be                                 supplemented by electric power and has been                                 widely applied in the USA and Europe.
 
Agriculture                                 and Aquaculture.
In temperate and colder climates, greatly                                 improved plant and fish growth can be achieved                                 by heating soils, greenhouses and fish ponds                                 using geothermal heat.
 
Power                                 Generation
High temperature geothermal reservoirs                                 containing water and/or steam can provide steam                                 to directly drive steam turbines and electrical                                 generation plant. Binary cycle sytems using heat                                 transfer media of lower boiling point than water                                 (such as organic fluids), enable power to be                                 generated from lower temperature resources.
 
With                                 over 8000 MW of installed capacity, geothermal                                 electric power generation is a well-proven technology that has been especially successful                                 in countries and islands that have a high                                 reliance on imported fossil fuels.
 
Small                                 and Mini-grid Power Generation.
Power plants as small as 100kW, but commonly                                 1-5MW, may provide distributed generation on                                 larger grids or they may be a major generation                                 source for smaller power grids. There is a                                 perception that geothermal power plants are base                                 load stations that operate 24 hours a day and                                 365 days a year. This is not necessarily the                                 case. Indeed geothermal power plants can be                                 designed to follow load demand if necessary such                                 as may be required in mini-grid applications.                                 Small power plants are usually built using a                                 modular approach that reduces site construction                                 costs and can be placed adjacent to the wells so                                 that the overall project has a minimal                                 environmental impact. The Ribeira Grande Geothermal field on Sao Miguel Island, Azores                                 has had a 5 MWe binary plant in operation since                                 1994. In Fang, Thailand there is a 300 KW binary                                 module which has been in use since 1989 and                                 utilises fluids of 116°C.
 
Grid-Based                                 Power Generation.
Power plants with generation units up to 100MW                                 in size are connected to national power grids                                 and usually operated in a base load mode,                                 operating at full capacity continuously 365 days                                 of the year. This type of generation is                                 widespread in Indonesia and the Philippines.
