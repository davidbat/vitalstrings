Humans have been enjoying water heated by the Earth for millenia. Bath, England, for example, got its name from the hot springs savored by relaxing Romans.
Nowadays, geothermal power plants also take advantage of water heated by the Earth's interior to boil water into steam. The steam then turns a turbine to make energy. Geothermal is cheap to operate, less expensive to build than nuclear and produces significantly less pollution than fossil fuels.
However, the need for accessible underground heat limited the technology to places like California, the Philippines, El Salvador and Iceland. But new technologies and maps of the Earth's crust are making geothermal a renewable energy competitor to fossil fuels, even in places like coal-rich West Virginia.
In fact, a recent study suggested the United States, already the world's top geothermal energy producer according to the Geothermal Energy Association , may have geothermal resources under its feet capable of producing 10 times the capacity of all coal plants now installed.
Want proof? Google it. The geothermal maps are available on Google Earth, which also helped fund the project.

Besides finding new sources of underground heat, advances in geothermal energy production are squeezing more juice from the beneath the Earth.
Many new geothermal plants can use water heated to as low as 57 degrees Celsius (135 degrees Fahrenheit). This system, called a binary cycle power plant, uses the hot water to vaporize another liquid with a lower boiling point. The secondary fluid then turns the turbines.
Using magma to boost the power of geothermal plants is way to boost energy output, as Discovery News reported.
