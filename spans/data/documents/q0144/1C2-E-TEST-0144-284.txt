Editorial Reviews
Review
"Geothermal energy is emerging as a significant renewable energy source in many places worldwide. This UNESCO book updates several publications over the last 30 years; however, its uniqueness results from its emphasis on methods and technologies to utilize earth heat after it has been extracted from the ground, as well as on nonelectrical applications that have previously been given lesser emphasis. Major subjects include geothermal background, electricity generation, space and district heating, space cooling, greenhouse, heating, aquaculture, industrial applications, environmental impacts and mitigation, and economics and financing. In this beautifully organized book, each chapter ends with select references, self-assessment questions, and answers. Numerous figures and tables appropriately augment the text. Instructive case histories and insightful practical examples are particularly illuminating. This book is an outstanding contribution; it speaks to the potential future of geothermal energy, and it should serve as an essential guidebook for developers and environmentalists as well as an introductory textbook to the futuristic promise of geothermal energy. Summing Up: Essential. Upper-division undergraduates through professionals; two-year technical program students."--T. L. T. Grose, Colorado School of Mines in CHOICE
