Electricity from:
Geothermal Energy
The heat from the          earth's own molten core can be converted into electricity. This core consists          primarily of extremely high temperature liquid rock known as magma. This          "geothermal" heat circulates within the rock or is transferred to underground          reservoirs of water, which also circulate under the earth's crust. Because          of the near limitless ability of the earth to produce magma, and the continuous          transfer of heat between subsurface rock and water, geothermal energy          is considered a renewable resource.
Geothermal resources          have been harnessed as an energy source since the dawn of civilization,          when natural hot springs were first used for cooking and bathing. The          geothermal resources tapped to generate electricity are far more intense          than those used for space heating and can reside as deep as 10,000 feet          below the earth's surface. Capital costs for the construction of geothermal          power plants are much higher than for large coal-fired plants or new natural          gas turbine technologies. But geothermal plants have reasonable operation          and maintenance costs and no fuel costs. Though more expensive than wind          power in most cases, new geothermal electricity generation facilities          are increasingly competitive with fossil options.
Geothermal plants can operate around-the-clock, which            increases their value from a reliability point-of-view, unlike some            intermittent renewable fuels such as solar and wind.
Geothermal electricity          generation technologies consist of either "flash" technology or "binary"          technology. With flash technology, water from 300 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit,          but still in liquid form, is piped from its highly pressurized underground          reservoir into a geothermal facility. Once this super-heated water is          released, it flashes into steam that then drives a conventional turbine          generator. With binary technology, underground reservoir waters of lower          temperatures are used for flashing. Heat from geothermal water is transferred          to a second (binary) liquid, which flashes into vapor upon heating, and          that vapor is used to drive turbines. (With dry steam technologies - a          much rarer fuel source but the one used in the world's largest geothermal          power plant at The Geysers in northern California -- highly pressurized          geothermal vapor is used directly to drive a turbine.)
What are the environmental impacts?
Flash technologies          allow the geothermal fluid to expand and release gases into the atmosphere          when the steam is created. Binary technology keeps the geothermal fluid          contained, using heat exchangers to capture heat to provide steam. Though          these air emissions represent tiny quantities and generally do not pose          any serious environmental threat, the chemical characteristics of geothermal          resources are highly site-specific. Dissolved gases usually include carbon          dioxide (CO2), methane, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen.
Groundwater contamination, which can be easily prevented, is          the principal pollution concern.
The disposal of water          and wastewater may cause significant pollution of surface waters and ground          water supplies. Still, used geothermal fluids are generally collected          and re-injected. This maintains pressures in underground reservoirs, but          also allows for recycling and reuse.
The best geothermal          resources are sometimes located at remote sites that may have significant          wilderness, scenic or recreation value. While requiring relatively little          land itself, the siting of a geothermal plant - like remote wind farms          -- may cause land impacts when new transmission lines are connected to          power plants in these rural regions.
