Geothermal
Sunrise Alternative Energy is Oklahoma City’s leader for geothermal installations.  We have been designing and installing geothermal for Oklahomans for over 25 years.  In that time, we have learned the “ins and outs” of geothermal in Oklahoma.
The single biggest factor for the success of your geothermal system is the installer. We realize that when you are considering geothermal for your home you have many options for installers in Oklahoma. What helps us stand out from the crowd, is that we are Oklahoma City’s only exclusively geothermal installers.  We do not sell or service any other kind of HVAC system for your home, in order that we can sufficiently focus on geothermal.  Because we are an alternative (renewable) energy company, we will approach your geothermal install from an energy efficiency standpoint, not an HVAC only standpoint.  In short, we look at your home as a whole, not just as an HVAC system.
If you are looking for a company you can trust, with years of geothermal installation experience in Oklahoma, then Sunrise Alternative Energy is your best choice.  If you have any questions about geothermal, would like us to come by and determine if geothermal will work in your home, or just need some more information, feel free to contact us .  If you would like more information on the way geothermal works, why it works, etc, then go here .
