nice thats what i wanted to do for my green house and then to top it off use hydroponics to grow my crops which actually uses less water and yields faster, healthier and bigger fruit and as an added recycle bonus i was going to have worms and mushrooms to break downï»¿ what i don't eat and a fish tank with talapia to eat extra scraps and worms and then that water and waste would be used with the compost for the plants. rinse and repeat for organic worms, healthy fish, fruit and vegi :)
