Renewable Energy
Geothermal
Idaho uses geothermal water for generating electricity; heating buildings; growing fish, alligators, and plants; and for recreation.  Idaho is a prime candidate for additional geothermal energy development in the future because the State has vast, untapped and underused geothermal resources. Idaho is proud to have the first geothermal power plant in the Pacific Northwest, the U.S. Geothermal Raft River Facility, which started generation in January 2008. In addition to power generation and direct use applications, the Idaho Governor's Office of Energy Resources actively supports the use of all heat pump technologies and applications including ground and water-source version.
