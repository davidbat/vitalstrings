 
Welcome,
Have you considered Geothermal for your Home or Business? Or perhaps you already have and were disappointed by the cost of the installation. Even worse, perhaps you were told that your property does not have the necessary room to install the loop for the system.
Hyperloop geothermal technology for pond/lake applications is currently available while we continue to test and collect data on our ground/earth applications. For further information as to when we release the ground model please sign-up for our newsletter, to the right.
HyperLoop (High Yield Poly Exchange Ready Loop) for ponds and lakes is a compact and prefabricated loop that greatly reduces loop build and installation time, shipping costs, site-specific engineering costs, sizing, and general loop size requirements.
All of these benefits equate to an overall savings on the total cost of your geothermal system. Hyperloop greatly increases your return on investment (ROI) and decreases your payback time. When factored in with Federal Tax Incentives, State Incentives and Utility Rebates, HyperLoop makes owning a geothermal system a “No Brainer”
HyperLoop makes it much easier to afford a geothermal system and gives you comfort in knowing that you are doing your part to reduce carbon emissions, and green house gases while eliminating our dependency on foreign oil.
