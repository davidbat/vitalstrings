Historically, among the country's indigenous resources,              it is the largest supplier of electricity and as contained in PEP              2003-2012, it will continue to be a significant source of energy for              the country (Figure 5). Based on 2001 data, geothermal generation              accounted for 22.2 percent of the power mix. Apart from providing              a substantial amount of electricity, geothermal resources, at the              same time, help the country save huge amounts of foreign exchange              through the displacement of a large fraction of imported fuels. For              the next ten years, geothermal energy is projected to displace an              average of 25 MMBFOE of imported fuel yearly, equivalent to foreign              exchange savings of about US$588.4 million (based on an average crude              price of US$25 per barrel).
To date, the country's total estimated potential of untapped geothermal                resource is about 2,600 MW. For the succeeding ten years, plans                to develop proven reserve areas will make possible the availability                of a maximum capacity of 1,200 MW of this estimated potential. Of                these potentials, about 610 MW are situated within service contract                areas belonging to the government-owned Philippine National Oil                Corporation-Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC)(Table 4).
To meet the estimated demand requirements, an average of 36 wells              per year needs to be drilled, 25 of which are intended to be developed              by PNOC-EDC while 11 wells are earmarked for private sector financing.              This contributes a modest average annual increase of 0.8 percent in              geothermal electricity production from 14.1 TWh in 2003 to 15.1 TWh              in 2012. Accordingly, fuel oil displacement is foreseen to rise from              23.5 MMBFOE in 2003 to 25.2 MMBFOE in 2012, corresponding to a total              of US$6.2 billion in foreign exchange savings for the ten-year planning              horizon.
There are two committed plants in the geothermal power plant line-up,                namely: PNOC-EDC's 80-MW Northern Negros plant in Negros Occidental                due for commissioning in 2005 and the Palinpinon 40-MW optimization                project in 2006. Meanwhile, as part of PNOC-EDC's aggressive geothermal                development, drilling of exploratory wells are slated to begin in                2003 for its prospects in Mt. Lobi and Mt. Cabalian, both located                in Southern Leyte, which are expected to confirm steam reserves                (Figure 6).
Incentives
Current incentives for geothermal service contractors are enumerated                under Presidential Decree No. 1442, otherwise known as "An                Act to Promote the Exploration and Development of Geothermal Resources".                These are:
1. Recovery of operating expenses not exceeding 90 percent of the                gross value in any year with carry -forward of unrecovered cost
2. Service fee of up to 40 percent of the net proceeds
3. Exemption from all taxes except income tax
4. Exemption from payment of tariff duties and compensating tax                on the importation of machinery, equipment, spare parts and all                materials for geothermal operations
5. Depreciation of capital equipment over a ten (10) year period
6. Easy repatriation of capital investments and remittance of earnings
7. Entry of alien technical and specialized personnel (including                members of immediate family
Challenges and Gaps
Despite being endowed with numerous active geothermal areas, the                country's substantial potential for geothermal energy remains to                be harnessed notwithstanding government's efforts to promote greater                investments in this sector. As the DOE endeavors to increase the                utilization of geothermal energy, strategies, plans and programs                are being pursued to encourage entry of more investors into the                sector. However, more efforts need to be exerted to spur development                in this sector.
Lack of awareness and interest in investment opportunities
There has been limited private sector investment in steamfield                  development. To-date, there are only two geothermal steamfield                  developers in the country, namely PNOC-EDC which operates a majority                  of the existing geothermal contract areas and Philippine Geothermal                  Incorporated (PGI), a subsidiary of the Union Oil of California                  (UNOCAL).
Environment and socio-cultural concerns
With the passage of laws for the preservation of the environment                  such as Republic Act 7586, or the National Integrated Protected                  Areas System (NIPAS) Act, and the empowerment of the cultural                  minorities such as Republic Act 8371, otherwise known as "Indigenous                  People's Rights Act (IPRA) of 1997, environmental and socio-cultural                  concerns are now considered critical factors in geothermal resource                  development. There is a need for the harmonization of the NIPAS                  and IPRA as these pose problems to RE investors in prospect areas                  that are both protected areas and ancestral lands. Moreover, acceptability                  of geothermal projects in view of these concerns may prolong the                  gestation period of geothermal projects and entail additional                  costs.
Technological constraints
The development of some promising geothermal areas has been temporarily                  set aside pending technological breakthroughs in handling acidic                  wells. An example is Mt. Labo which is located within the boundaries                  of Quezon, Camarines Sur, and Camarines Norte. Eight wells have                  been drilled in Mt. Labo from 1990 to 1997 but all intersected                  acidic geothermal fluids. Similarly, the wellhead assembly at                  Alto Peak area of Tongonan Field in Leyte suffered a blowout and                  was knocked off due to the fast rate of corrosion from geothermal                  fluids. Unless innovative technologies are developed to handle                  these natural constraints, harnessing of Mt. Labo and Alto Peak                  (with combined resource potential of 80 MW) and other areas with                  significant resource potentials may be delayed.
Lack of investment in non-power applications
The country has yet to take off in terms of development of non-power                  applications of geothermal energy resources. Mainly resulting                  from a lack of financing and public awareness, the development                  of spa resorts and crop drying facilities using geothermal heat                  is still in the early stages.
While there is a huge potential for geothermal heat in crop drying,                  harnessing of this potential is hampered by the preference for                  sunlight, which is the traditional source of energy for drying                  in the country. People have yet to realize the benefits of using                  geothermal heat, especially in terms of time saved in drying owing                  to its high temperature and non-seasonality compared to sunlight.                  The ideal use of geothermal heat, which will bring about large                  savings in fossil energy consumption, will be for industrial purposes.                  In this light, bringing geothermal heat to industrial installations                  or bringing industries near geothermal fields poses an additional                  challenge in order to achieve increased use of the resource in                  industries. Examples of such industries include pulp and paper,                  veneer factory, timber drying, beer brewery and distillation and                  confectionary industry.
PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS
The DOE will conduct international and local promotion of investment                opportunities in Philippine geothermal exploration and development                to increase private sector investments and encourage the entry of                modern and innovative technologies. Exploration programs, including                reconnaissance activities and semi-detailed studies of potential                geothermal areas will be sustained to provide sufficient information                to prospective developers and investors. Socio-economic profiling                of at least seven prospects will also be continued to provide a                glimpse of the geothermal utilization demand in the target areas.
Optimal use for non-power applications
To demonstrate the government's efforts to focus on promoting                  the non-power application of geothermal resources, proposals for                  a multi-crop dryer project in Leyte and for the enhancement of                  the self-reliant multi-crop dryer project in Manito, Albay will                  be pursued. A showcase project exists in the Palinpinon geothermal                  complex in Southern Negros facilitating the operations of a local                  cooperative on agricultural products.
In addition, close cooperation with the Department of Tourism                  (DOT) and the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative                  Health Care (PITAHC) for promoting hot spring areas for possible                  spa resort development will likewise be pursued. The project will                  revitalize the use of geothermal resources for balneology and                  therapeutic purposes. Site assessment of four more areas, namely                  Camiguin Island in Cagayan, Mt. Apo in Cotabato, Northern Negros                  and Tuba in Benguet will be conducted.
A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was forged in May 2002 to delineate                  the scope of cooperation. The DOT will lead the implementation                  of the project and will prepare an investment promotion package                  for spa resort development. On the other hand, DOE will identify                  the hot spring areas favorable for spa resort development. The                  PITAHC will train the locals on therapeutic massage and the use                  of herbs for therapy.
Intensive promotion of geothermal energy
Geothermal energy exploration and development will be a part                  of the DOE's aggressive investment promotion campaigns. Public                  awareness campaigns will be conducted to boost private sector                  investments in geothermal projects, enhance its acceptability                  and harmonize the same with environmental and social concerns,                  as highlighted by the enactment of NIPAS and IPRA, respectively.
As an initial effort, international cooperation for the Coordinating                  Committee on Coastal and Offshore Geoscience Programme (CCOP)                  Project on Regional Geothermal Database Compilation shall continue                  until 2006. The project aims to produce base maps and a geothermal                  database in CD-ROM.
Meanwhile, the DOE recently entered into an agreement with the                  DENR to consider geothermal areas for use as airsheds. Under Memorandum                  Circular (MC) No. 2002-13 issued by the DENR, geothermal airsheds                  shall be provided for geothermal areas with existing projects                  and those listed in the PEP and other areas designated by DOE                  as well as areas that may be affected by the dispersion of air                  pollutants from geothermal operations. The guidelines embodied                  in the MC are expected to facilitate the compliance of the geothermal                  power sector with the Clean Air Act (R.A. 8749).
