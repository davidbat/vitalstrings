Texas Geothermal Energy
 
All of the earth underneath the United States has some thermal capacity. The question is how to access that heat and get it to generate turbines. Alexander Karsner, U. S. Department of Energy, 2007
 
Though little recognized by the general public, geothermal energy (“earth heat”) is the third largest source of renewable energy in the   United States, behind hydropower and biomass. Hundreds of thousands of megawatts of geothermal power lie beneath the surface   in the United States, practically inexhaustible and waiting for new exploration tools, better resource    techniques,  lower-cost drilling technologies, and improved   methods of predicting  the behavior of geothermal reservoirs. As new technologies are being developed, so is the interest in mining the earth's heat.
Accelerating oil and electricity prices have also  encouraged the use of the earth's heat, which is generated both from drilling wells deep into the earth to produce electricity from heated              water (hydrothermal heat) and from the the high temperatures of the earth itself closer to the surface, which is used to heat and cool buildings and homes. This method most often uses geothermal heat pumps that work with heat exchangers to transfer              heat between warm and cool spaces.
Geothermal power plants have much in common with traditional power-generating   stations, using many of the same components, including turbines, generators,   transformers, and other standard power generating equipment. View these animations from the U.S. Department of Energy to learn more about how geothermal systems   work.
As of 2007, 58 new geothermal energy projects were   under development in the U.S., which will provide an additional 2,250 MW of   electric power capacity and 18 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually   when completed. The Geothermal Energy Association credits the federal production tax credit with the current expansion of the geothermal industry.
The map below shows  areas of  geothermal resources in the United States. The white areas show low temperature areas  good for geothermal heat pumps (geoexchange systems) that can work almost anywhere in the United States. The blue areas have hotter water for direct use projects, and the pink areas have the  high temperatures required for most geothermal electrical power generation.  Geothermal electrical power generation has  traditionally been more restricted to the western states where high  temperatures are closer to the surface of the Earth.
This Geothermal Energy Uses poster created by the Geothermal Education Office illustrates the typical uses of geothermal  energy at  various underground temperatures. Southern Methodist University's Geothermal Laboratory has a full-size poster available. Please email the Geothermal Lab if you would like one.

Texas Geothermal Resources
Texas has thousands of wells that have              high enough temperatures for the possible development of geopressured and geothermal resources. Geothermal                energy can be generated anywhere in the state. However the                biggest technical issue facing geothermal development                is determining where and how deep the resources are                and how companies can get to and utilize them.
In 2007   state lands were leased for the first time to research  possible              geothermal energy development. Ten percent of any income from energy              produced on this land will go to the state’s Permanent              School Fund.
Using  Oil & Gas  Wells
Accessing geothermal power by drilling   for water (photo) or steam,  is similar to  drilling for  oil and gas. Texas has an  advantage in drilling for geothermal resources as the state has decades of experience              with  oil and gas extraction, with  access to detailed subsurface analyses of  heat resources,  reservoirs   and deep water availability.
Oil and gas wells co-produce additional hot fluids that require disposal. This fluid could be a bonanza for the  geothermal industry, while sparing the oil and gas industries  the expense of disposal of these co-produced fluids. Equally advantageous is the existence              of large amounts of data on existing wells.
Using tapped out oil and gas wells could greatly reduce the costs involved in  exploration and drilling even though retrieving geothermal resources to generate electricity              is a significantly different process from that of oil              and gas drilling and would involve redesign and redrilling.
Texas Geothermal Research
State              Energy Conservation Office (SECO)  has been working with the Southern Methodist University's  Geothermal Laboratory and the University of              Texas at Permian Basin (UTPB) to analyze existing oil and gas-well data to develop the expertise to determine              how this information can be used for geothermal energy exploration. SMU's Geothermal Laboratory  estimates              that within the next ten years, Texas could have 2,000 to              10,000 MW in generating capacity from geothermal              resources accessed through oil and gas wells.
In January 2007,  the State Energy Conservation Office (SECO) published a ground-breaking  study, Geopowering Texas: Conversion of Deep Gas Wells and Fields into  Geothermal Energy Wells ,  by Dr. Richard Erdlac at UTPB.  This data provides advance knowledge of the best areas to go for heat energy   acquisition. The three-year  exploration and resource research project  focused on West Texas, identifying and assessing potential sites for converting depleted deep gas wells and fields              into geothermal energy wells to generate renewable electrical              power. This UTPB map shows five areas in Texas with either deep sedimentary basins or areas of high   temperatures sufficiently close to the Earth's surface for possible use in   electrical energy production.
The study proposes   that the idea behind Texas  geothermal production is the reuse of the wells drilled by the oil and gas industry  that are either  sufficiently deep to encounter hot water, or that  could be deepened into these hot zones. In Pecos County, for example, temperatures of nearly  300°F are found in wells of around 18,000 feet.  One purpose of the study was  to develop the  needed subsurface databases and maps to enable the energy industry to expand  their activities to acquiring the subsurface heat for generating renewable  electrical power from sedimentary basins. Researchers              estimate that electric power production potential from Texas oil and gas wells range from 400              MW  to over 2,000 MW.
In early 2008, SECO will publish a second geothermal study performed by the Southern Methodist University (SMU) Geothermal              Laboratory that will focus on East Texas (east of IH-35). The use of hot waste water from existing hydrocarbon wells is a feasible              electrical energy solution. The project goal              is to develop site specific locations for geothermal electrical power production in existing Texas hydrocarbon fields, with              the ultimate goal to develop specific examples for proof-of-concept              tests of geothermal electrical generation in Texas.
SECO has also contracted with Southern Methodist University's Geothermal Laboratory  to create a geothermal outreach and networking group, in conjunction with the U. S. Department of   Energy's GeoPowering the West program,  with the  intent  to              move Texas from a state of little geothermal knowledge              and consumption, to one where geothermal becomes an              important component of the renewable energy industry. A program goal is the development of additional geothermal projects in Texas. One new geothermal project being developed is geothermal   energy generation from oil and gas waste fluids.
An additional SECO study, Texas              Renewable Energy Resource              Assessment , was performed by Virtus Energy Research Associates to evaluate Texas renewable energy                resources in 1995, including  geothermal. The report is currently being updated.
The map of Texas geothermal resources  below shows  that a largely  untapped energy resource lies underneath our feet that can be developed for  electrical power generation. Hydrothermal,  geopressured and hot dry rock resources areas are identified (these terms are described below). The orange color  represents the known potential for hydrothermal uses such as space heating,  fish farming, desalinization and resort spas. The green color shows the known  potential for geopressure uses such as heating, enhanced oil recovery and electricity.  The blue areas show the known potential for hot dry rock uses such as heating  and electricity.
The map also shows that there are at least five major regions within  Texas that have a strong potential for geothermal electrical power  production. These include  East Texas, the Gulf Coast, the Delaware-Val  Verde Basin  region, the Trans-Pecos region, and the Aardvark Basin  where it enters the Texas Panhandle. The region consisting of the Maverick Basin  along the South Texas–Mexico border may represent an independent sixth area for  consideration. These  regions are based upon the existence of oil and gas wells with temperatures  that can get above 212oF. The locations and boundaries of the geothermal areas illustrated are approximate.
SMU's Geothermal Laboratory has provided a set of maps to illustrate the temperatures and fluid flow needed for successful geothermal electrical              power production in Texas.
The following three descriptions refer to the resources identified by the map shown above.
Hydrothermal resources
Hydrothermal  resources are composed  of hot water and/or steam that is found in fractured or porous rock at shallow  to moderate depths as a result of the intrusion of molten  magma into the earth’s crust, or from the deep circulation of water through  fault or fracture systems.
Geopressured resources
A geopressured resource consists of hot brine  saturated with methane and found in large, deep aquifers that are under higher  pressure due to water trapped in the burial process. The northern Gulf of Mexico  is the largest region discovered that contains this type of resource.
Hot dry rock
Hot dry rock  is a heated  geological formation formed in the manner of hydrothermal resources, but  containing no water due to the absence of aquifers or fractures required to  transport water. This resource is huge  in comparison to hydrothermal resources.
Future development of geothermal energy in Texas will fall along  three lines: geoexchange systems (heat pumps), direct use activities, and electric power  generation.  Several different companies    that  install geoexchange systems are centered in Texas. Direct  use application is less developed, and is used only locally at several places  in Central Texas. Electrical power generation has not yet become  commercially established.

Heat Pump               (geoexchange system)
A geothermal   heat pump system consists of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the   building. Fluid (mostly water) circulating in the pipes carries heat into a building in the winter
and pulls heat out of the building in the summer,                  exchanging the heat with the cooler surroundings                  at either end of the loop. Like an air conditioner or furnace, a geothermal heat pump  is an electrically powered  heating and cooling system, but it  moves                  heat from and to the earth to take advantage of the almost constant temperature                  occurring just a few feet underground, which is usually warmer than the air in winter and                  cooler than the air in summer. See this photo of piping being laid down for a geoexchange system.
Geoexchange systems are more expensive to install, but much more efficient and cost- effective than competing fuel technologies, and  can be developed anywhere in Texas for our homes, businesses and schools. Costs can be recouped                    in two to 10 years through energy savings.
Geothermal heat pump installation (loop water pumps and piping).
Presently,  many Texas homes, schools and other buildings are using geoexchange systems to take advantage of the cost savings in heating and cooling the inside of a  building. 
Direct Use
Direct geothermal use taps hot water or heat from below the ground, near the earth's surface, to generate electricity for industrial heating needs, fish farming , food processing facilities, pasteurizing milk, spas and hot springs , nurseries ,  and residential and commercial heating. The hot water can also be piped directly under roads and sidewalks to melt snow, and even to  heat a network of buildings in  a community. Dehydration, the drying                    of onions and garlic, is the largest industrial use of                    geothermal energy. See this DOE article, Direct Use of Geothermal Energy .
Texas Trans-Pecos region
The key to the development of direct use geothermal  energy in Texas  is access to hot water. While there are  some hot springs  that have been identified in the Trans-Pecos region, an undeveloped source  of hot water comes from oil and gas wells that were  drilled by prospectors in the search for oil and  gas.
Some                    of the manifestations of  underground reservoirs are volcanoes, fumaroles , hot springs and geysers, such as Old Faithful , the most famous geyser in Yellowstone National Park.
Direct  use of geothermal energy for homes and commercial operations can achieve savings up to 80% lower than  fossil fuels. 
Geothermal                  Power Plant
A geothermal power plant (photo) uses geothermal                  steam or heat to drive turbine-generators to produce                  electricity. Three different types make use of the various                  temperature ranges of geothermal resources: dry steam (photo), flash and binary (these terms are described below).
The typical size range for a geothermal power  plant is from 10 to 250 MW.  One MW  (8,760,000 kWh) of electricity will meet the needs of approximately 1,000  households  for one year. Meeting a 250 MW generating plant output from fossil fuels  would require 1,288,994 bbls of oil, or 7,227,722 mcf of natural gas, or  280,769 tons of coal per year. 
See this NREL web page describing steam plants and binary plants .
The Geysers in California supply power for several plants. These power plants emit only excess steam and very minor amounts of gases.

In traditional geothermal electricity production,              using near-surface high temperature water or steam,              three methods are used to convert thermal energy              into the mechanical energy of a spinning turbine. The following three descriptions refer to these methods.
Dry steam
Power plants using dry steam systems were the first type of geothermal power   generation plants built. Dry steam is extremely hot water that is already in  the form of steam and thus ready to drive a steam  turbine. In this type of well, the very hot pressurized steam is produced at high speed. A dry steam power plant (photo)  brings the  steam  to the surface of the earth to turn a turbine and generate electricity. At the end of the process, the water  is returned to the thermal reservoir through  an injection well to replenish this renewable energy resource. This technology is well developed and  commercially available. See DOE's Dry steam power plants  description.
Flash steam
Flash steam plants are the most common type of geothermal power generation   plants in operation today. A flash  steam power plant (photo) vaporizes water                above 360° F by releasing it from the pressurized                reservoir into a lower-pressure flash tank. The hot water  is ‘flashed’ into steam through a  pressure drop within the  tank. The  steam then drives a turbine to produce electricity. Flash steam power  generators are in the  size range of 10MW to 55MW, with 20MW being a standard size being used in many countries. See DOE's Flash steam power plants  description.
Binary cycle
The use of two separate fluids for power  generation gives the name ‘binary’ to this type of power plant. In this  process, the geothermal fluid is brought to the surface and passed through a  heat exchanger to heat   another “working fluid” which is vaporized and used to turn the   turbine/generator units.  The geothermal water, and the working fluid are each confined in separate   circulating systems or “closed loops” and never come in contact with each other. The secondary fluid is reused  again and again as it runs through vaporization and condensing phases. The geothermal fluid is injected back into  the ground in a closed-loop system. The binary cycle method has the greatest potential for expanded electricity generation because  it allows producers to take advantage of  lower-temperature fluids (225° F - 360° F). Additionally, this method produces no air emissions. See DOE's Binary-cycle power plants  description.
What are hydrocarbons?
A hydrocarbon  is a mix of hydrogen and carbon.  The most common hydrocarbons are natural gas, oil, coal and methane. Petroleum (liquid geologically-extracted hydrocarbons) is a complex mixture of   hydrocarbons. The oil reserves that are found in sedimentary rocks are the principal source of hydrocarbons for the energy industries. Our electric energy and heat sources (such as home heaters, which use either oil or natural gas) come from the energy produced when hydrocarbons are burned.
How can waste water from existing wells provide geothermal energy?
Once considered a nuisance, hot water encountered during petroleum production is   attracting increasing interest due to the energy potential it offers. Wells currently drilled for petroleum extraction often reach the depths   necessary to access moderate to high-temperature geothermal   fluids. The hot water produced from these oil field wells is   regarded as a waste product, but  geothermal technologies can use this hot water    to generate electricity to power on-site operations. In addition,  existing transmission   infrastructure can deliver excess power back to the grid.

National Geothermal Reports
In it's 2008 Annual Energy Outlook , The U.S. Department of Energy's  Energy Information Administration    projected  geothermal power production to increase 88.4% by 2030.
In 2007, an MIT-led panel , which included the Geothermal Lab of Southern Methodist University, released a comprehensive study, The Future of Geothermal Energy . The  analysis showed that it is possible to supply 10% of the U.S. electric   generation capacity from geothermal power plants by the middle of the century.             It estimated that    if 40 percent of the heat under the United States could be tapped, it would meet   our nation's energy demand 56,000 times over. See the report summary .
The  Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) has released a November, 2007 report, The State of Geothermal Technology ,              which says that the key to making use of the untapped geothermal energy resources that lie beneath   our feet is to improve the technologies used to discover and tap into those   resources. The report describes the techniques used to find and exploit   geothermal reservoirs and fleshes out those techniques with specific case   studies, providing a useful overview of the technologies employed by the   geothermal energy industry and the challenges the industry faces. The report also calls for building a test facility to try out the concepts of   so-called Enhanced Geothermal Systems , in which geothermal resources are   modified to enhance their energy production.
GEA's May, 2007 report, Update   on World Geothermal Development , examines the              progress in international geothermal power development since 2005. It notes projects              under development, major political and/or policy initiative related to development, and             plans announced by either governments or in-country parties.
Another 2007 report, U .S. Geothermal Market Report estimates that  there is a realistic potential to increase U.S. geothermal power   production by a factor of six.
