Introduction  
The centre of the Earth is around 6000 degrees                    Celsius - easily hot enough to melt rock. Even a few kilometres                    down, the temperature can be over 250 degrees Celsius if the                    Earth's crust is thin. In general, the temperature rises one                    degree Celsius for every 30 - 50 metres you go down, but this                    does vary depending on location
In volcanic areas, molten rock can be very close                    to the surface. Sometimes we can use that heat.
Geothermal energy has been used for thousands                    of years in some countries for cooking and heating.
The name "geothermal" comes from two Greek words: "geo" means "Earth" and "thermal" means "heat".
How it works
Hot rocks underground heat water to                produce steam.
We drill holes down to the hot region, steam comes up, is purified                and used to drive turbines, which drive electric generators.
There may be natural "groundwater" in the hot rocks anyway,                or we may need to drill more holes and pump water down to them.
The first geothermal power station was built at                  Landrello, in Italy, and the second was at Wairekei in New Zealand.                  Others are in Iceland, Japan, the Philippines and the United States.
In Iceland, geothermal heat is used to heat houses                  as well as for generating electricity.
If the rocks aren't hot enough to produce steam                  we can sometimes still use the energy - the Civic Centre in Southampton,                  England, is partly heated this way as part of a district heating scheme with thousands of customers..

More
Geothermal                energy is an important resource in volcanically active places such                as Iceland and New Zealand.
How useful it is depends on how hot the                water gets. This depends on how hot the rocks were to start with,                and how much water we pump down to them.
Water is pumped down an "injection                well", filters through the cracks in the rocks in the hot region,                and comes back up the "recovery well" under pressure.                It "flashes" into steam when it reaches the surface.
The steam may be used to drive a turbogenerator,                or passed through a heat exchanger to heat water to warm houses.                A town in Iceland is heated this way.
The steam must be purified before it                is used to drive a turbine, or the turbine blades will get "furred                up" like your kettle and be ruined.

Advantages  
Geothermal energy does not produce any pollution,                  and does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.
The power stations do not take up much room, so                  there is not much impact on the environment.
No fuel is needed.
Once you've built a geothermal power station, the                  energy is almost free.
It may need a little energy to run a pump, but this can be taken                  from the energy being generated.
Disadvantages
The big problem is that there are not many places where            you can build a geothermal power station.
You need hot rocks of a suitable type, at a depth where we can drill            down to them.
The type of rock above is also important, it must be of a type that            we can easily drill through.
Sometimes a geothermal site may "run out of steam",            perhaps for decades.
Hazardous gases and minerals may come up from underground, and can be difficult to safely dispose of.
Is it renewable?
Geothermal energy is renewable .
The energy keeps on coming, as long as we don't pump too much cold water          down and cool the rocks too much.
