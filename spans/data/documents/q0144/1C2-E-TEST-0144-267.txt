What is Geothermal?
Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) are electrically powered systems that tap the stored energy of the         greatest solar collector in existence: the earth. These systems use the earth's relatively constant         temperature to provide heating, cooling, and hot water for homes and commercial         buildings.

How efficient is a GSHP?
The GSHP is one of the most efficient residential heating and cooling systems available         today, with heating efficiencies 50 to 70% higher than other heating systems and cooling efficiencies 20 to         40% higher than available air conditioners. That directly translates into savings for you on your utility         bills.
Can one system provide both space         heating and cooling for my home? And what about heating hot water? 
Yes. A GSHP can be a combination heating/cooling and hot water heating system. You can         change from one mode to another with a simple flick on your indoor thermostat. Using a desuperheater, some         GSHPs can save you up to 50% on your water-heating bill by preheating tank water.
How does a GSHP system heat water for         my home? 
Using what is called a desuperheater, GSHPs turn waste heat to the task of heating hot         water. During the summer, when the system is in cooling mode, your hot water is produced free as a         byproduct of the thermal process. In winter, with the heating mode, the desuperheater heats a portion of         your hot water. Desuperheaters are standard on some units, optional on others. Stand-alone systems that         will heat water all year around can be purchased.
How much space does a GSHP unit         require? 
Most of a GSHP installation is underground. Inside the house, the heat pump units are         about the same size as a traditional heating and cooling unit.
How long will my         GSHP system last? 
GSHPs are durable and highly reliable. The GSHP contains fewer mechanical components,         and all components are either buried in the ground or located inside the home, which protects them from         outside conditions. The underground pipe carries up to a 50-year warranty.
How noisy is the         GSHP unit? 
GSHPs are very quiet, providing a pleasant environment inside & outside of the         home. GSHPs have no noisy fan units to disturb outdoor activities, on or near the patio.
How safe are         GSHPs? 
GSHP systems are safe and protected. With no exposed equipment outdoors, children or         pets cannot injure themselves or damage exterior units. GSHPs have no open flame, flammable fuel or         potentially dangerous fuel storage tanks.
What about         comfort? 
A GSHP system moves warm air (90-105(F) throughout your home or business via standard         ductwork. An even comfort level is created because the warm air is moved in slightly higher volumes and         saturates the building with warmth more evenly. This helps even out hot or colds spots and eliminates the         cold air blasts common with fossil fuel furnaces.
How effective is         this underground system? 
The buried pipe, or ground loop, is the most recent technical advancement in heat pump         technology. Recently, new heat pump designs and improved buried pipe materials have been combined to make         GSHP systems the most efficient heating and cooling systems available.
Are GSHP systems         guaranteed? 
Nearly all GSHP system manufacturers offer a warranty for major components that is         equivalent to the warranties for conventional heating and cooling systems. Manufacturers of plastic pipe         used for ground loops warrant their products for 50 years.
Can these systems be used for         commercial, industrial, or apartment requirements?
Yes! Many GSHP systems are being installed using a multitude of systems hooked up to an         array of buried vertical or horizontal loops. This simplifies zone control and internal load balancing.
What are the         advantages to an HVAC dealer? 
GSHP systems create a huge retrofit market not subject to wild fluctuations in housing         construction. There is also ample opportunity for stable growth benefiting the dealer and his employees. In         addition, these systems are relatively maintenance-free, requiring only regular filter changes. This means         fewer maintenance and support calls. There is no outside equipment, so wear and tear is         less.
Savings /         Costs:
How will I save money with a         GSHP?
GSHPs save money, both in operating costs and maintenance costs. Investments can be         recouped in as little as three years. There is a positive cash flow, since the energy savings usually         exceeds payment on the system.
How much does a GSHP         cost? 
The initial investment for a GSHP system is greater than that of a conventional system.         However, when you consider the operating costs of a geothermal heating, cooling, and water heating system,         energy savings quickly offset the initial difference in purchase price.
What other costs         are there besides the GSHP system? 
You can expect an installation charge for any electrical work, ductwork, water hook-up,         and other provisions or adaptations to your home that are required. Your installer can estimate these costs         in advance.
How would increased use of GSHP         systems affect electricity cost and availability? 
The reduced peak load requirements would allow utilities to serve more customers and to         lower fixed costs per customer, thus offsetting some increased variable costs. This would result in less         cost per kilowatt, since fixed investment for new capacity is high.
Does my state offer any incentives         for installing a GSHP system? 
Some utilities offer rebates or incentives to their customers who purchase GSHPs. To         see what your state has to offer click here.
Installation:
Are GSHP systems         difficult to install? 
Most units are easy to install, especially when they are replacing another forced-air         system. This is known as a retrofit. GSHPs can be installed in areas unsuitable for fossil fuel furnaces         because there is no combustion and thus no need to vent exhaust fumes. Ductwork must be installed in homes         without an existing air distribution system. Your dealer or installer can assess the cost of installing         ductwork.
Can I install a         ground source heat exchanger myself? 
It's not recommended. Thermal fusion of the pipe, drilling and trenching are procedures         best handled by licensed professionals. Nonprofessional installations may result in less than optimum         performance, which could cancel out anticipated savings
How far apart are         trenches and vertical boreholes spaced? 
Trenches are spaced four to five feet apart while boreholes are spaced ten to fifteen         feet apart.
How long does it         take to install a horizontal system? 
This depends on soil conditions, length and depth of pipe, and equipment required. A         typical installation can be completed in one or two days.
How long does it take to install a         vertical system? 
With the vertical installation, time varies with conditions on the site such as type         and depth of the overburden, type and hardness of the bedrock, and the presence of aquifers. Typical         drilling times are one or two days; total installation can usually be accomplished in two days.
What are the advantages and         disadvantages of the horizontal and vertical installations,               respectively? 
Horizontal installations are simpler, requiring lower-cost equipment. However, they         require longer lengths of pipe due to seasonal variations in soil temperature and moisture content. Since a         horizontal heat exchanger is laid out in trenches, a larger area is usually required than for a vertical         system. Where land is limited, vertical installations or a compact Slinky™ horizontal installation can be         ideal. If regional soil conditions include extensive hard rock, a vertical installation may be the only         available choice. Vertical installations tend to be more expensive due to the increased cost of drilling         versus trenching, but since the heat exchanger is buried deeper than with a horizontal system, vertical         systems are usually more efficient and can get by with less total pipe. Your GSHP contractor will be able         to help you decide which configuration best meets your specific needs.
How can I be sure the pipe is         installed properly? 
Use a reputable contractor. Don't be afraid to ask for and use references. Reputable         dealers and loop installers will be happy to give names and phone numbers for you to call and confirm their         capabilities. Find out where the installer received training, whether he or she is IGSHPA-accredited, and         how many systems he or she has installed. Also, check with your utility company representative for names of         installers. A list of IGSHPA-trained and accredited installers is available on our website.
Is it advisable         to install a GSHP system large enough to handle my total heating         needs? 
GSHP systems are generally sized to meet all your cooling needs. Depending on heating         needs, a GSHP system usually supplies 80-100 percent of your design heating load. Sizing the system to         handle your entire heating needs may result in slightly lower heating costs, but the savings may not offset         the added total of the larger system. Special consideration should be given to systems in the north where         multiple capacity units should be considered to handle the large variation between heating and cooling         loads. Your dealer/installer should provide a heating and cooling load calculation to guide your equipment         selection.
Environment /         Climate:
How do GSHPs protect the         environment? 
GSHP systems conserve natural resources by providing climate control very         efficiently-thus also lowering emissions. GSHPs also minimize ozone layer destruction by using         factory-sealed refrigeration systems, which will seldom or never have to be recharged.
What are the         environmental benefits of GSHP systems? 
Currently installed systems are making a huge difference in our environment! The         systems are eliminating more than three million tons of carbon dioxide and is equivalent of taking 650,000         automobiles off the road. GSHP systems conserve energy and, because they move heat that already exists         rather than burning something to create heat, they reduce the amount of toxic emissions in the atmosphere.         They use renewable energy from the sun, and because the system doesn't rely on outside air, it keeps the         air inside of buildings cleaner and free from pollens, outdoor pollutants, mold spores, and other         allergens.
Do soil freezing conditions create         any problems? 
Not if a system is properly designed and installed. The three to four foot depths allow         the sun to melt the frozen soil during the summer. Adequate length per ton capacity prevents objectionable         soil movement.
Does this mean         that in extremely cold climates additional heat sources are         necessary? 
All systems require an emergency back up. Heat pumps can provide all the heat necessary         even in the coldest weather. An economic analysis by your contractor should dictate what portion of the         heat should be provided by the heat pump and what portion by auxiliary means.
Concerning Your Home:
Will my existing ductwork function with this         system? 
Yes, in most cases. Your dealer or installer will be able to determine ductwork         requirements and if any minor modifications are needed.
Will an         underground loop affect my lawn or landscape? 
No. Research has shown that loops have no adverse effects on grass, trees, or shrubs.         Most horizontal installations require trenches about six inches wide. Temporary bare areas can be restored         with grass seed or sod. Vertical loops require little space and do not damage lawns significantly.
My yard contains many shade trees.         Will this affect ground temperature and my ability to use it as an energy         source? 
Not at all. The system is installed deep enough that it utilizes constant ground         temperature.
Can a GSHP system be added to my         fossil fuel furnace? 
Yes. Called dual systems, they can easily be added to existing furnaces for those         wishing to have a dual-fuel heating system. Dual-fuel systems use the GSHP system as the main heating         source, and a fossil fuel furnace as a supplement in extremely cold weather should additional heat be         needed.
Will I have to add insulation to my         home if I install one of these systems? 
Ground source heat pump systems will reduce your heating and cooling costs regardless         of how well your home is insulated. However, insulating and weatherizing are key factors in gaining the         maximum amount of savings from any type of heating and cooling system.
