GEO Supports California GHP Bill
In a March 29 letter to Chairman Steven Bradford and Members of the California General Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, Geothermal Exchange Organization (GEO) President Doug Dougherty expressed the association's and industry support for AB 2339, the Renewable Thermal Energy Deployment Act, which directs the California Public Utilities Commission—in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders—to evaluate policies, develop sufficient infrastructure and adopt rules to overcome barriers to the wide-spread deployment and use of geothermal and solar heating and cooling technologies.
    "GEO is the national trade association representing the geothermal heat pump (GHP) industry.  We stand in full support of Assembly Bill 2339 and its mandate that requires the California Public Utilities Commission to identify and address barriers to more widespread installations GHP technologies.
    "Buildings consume 73% of the nation’s electricity. GHPs are among the most energy efficient, environmentally clean and cost effective systems available for heating and air conditioning. A GHP is a distributed technology that captures a thermal form of renewable energy from the Earth, and it is available everywhere.
    "GHPs save 40 to 70% of energy consumption by buildings of all sizes, which would go
a long way toward helping California meet its visionary carbon emission reduction goals. With current federal tax credits and other incentives, payback for the consumer (depending on the structure) can be in some cases be immediate, and certainly no longer than 3 to 5 years.  At the same time, increased installations of GHPs would create a variety of well paid jobs across the state.
    "GHPs should be included in California energy policy, and GEO believes that AB 2339 is a good start in recognizing GHPs for the environmental and economic benefits that they offer to your state and its citizens."  See the proposed legislation here .
