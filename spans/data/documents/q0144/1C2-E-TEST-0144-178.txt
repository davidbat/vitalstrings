Geothermal Energy
What          Is Geothermal Energy? Geothermal energy is the natural heat         of the Earth, which is transferred from the hot core of the         planet         to the         much cooler surface by conduction of heat through rocks. It is this same         heat that produces the molten lava, hot ash and gases         that we see spewing from an erupting volcano.         Geothermal         energy can be harnessed by modern technology and brought to the surface         as steam or hot water and converted to electricity.
Miles beneath the Earth's surface lies one of the world's largest energy          resources—geothermal energy. Our ancestors have used geothermal          energy for cooking and bathing since prehistoric times. Today, we use          this enormous energy reservoir to supply millions of people with clean,          low-cost electricity. Geothermal          power plants use wells to pipe steam and hot water trapped underground          to the surface to make electricity. The power plants produce electricity          at 5¢ to 7.5¢ per kilowatt-hour. The          Geysers Power Plant in northern California—the world's largest          geothermal power plant—generates more than 1700 megawatts of electrical          power. Geothermal power plants are highly reliably and can operate 24          hours a day. Most power plants operate more than 95 percent of the time.
Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)
The accessible U.S. EGS resource base is enormous — greater than 13 million quads or 130,000 times the current annual consumption of primary energy in the  United States.
Abundant             Power from Universal Geothermal Energy  —An MIT chemical engineer explains why new technologies could finally make “heat       mining” practical nearly anywhere on earth. By Kevin Bullis
A comprehensive new MIT-led study of the potential for geothermal energy within       the United States has found that mining the huge amounts of heat that reside       as stored thermal energy in the Earth's hard rock crust could supply a substantial       portion of the electricity the United States will need in the future, probably      at competitive prices and with minimal environmental impact.
An 18-member panel led by MIT prepared the 400-plus page study, titled " The             Future of Geothermal Energy " (PDF, 14.1 MB). Sponsored by the             U.S. Department of Energy, it is the first study in some 30 years to             take             a new look at geothermal, an energy resource that has been largely             ignored.
The goal of the study was to assess the feasibility, potential environmental             impacts and economic viability of using enhanced geothermal system (EGS)             technology to greatly increase the fraction of the U.S. geothermal resource             that could be recovered commercially.
Although geothermal energy is produced commercially today and the United             States is the world's biggest producer, existing U.S. plants have focused             on the high-grade geothermal systems primarily located in isolated         regions of the west. This new study takes a more ambitious look at this         resource             and evaluates its potential for much larger-scale deployment...
MIT-led panel           backs 'heat mining' as key U.S. energy source
Gene         Wescott , a geophysicist and Professor Emeritus at the University         of  Alaska, Fairbanks has explored the possible use of geothermal         energy in          the Aleutian         Islands to produce hydrogen for use in clean automobiles.
...Several decades ago, when            the world was searching for new types of energy, Professor Wescott             was dispatched from his campus in Fairbanks to a long string of islands             that stretches             for 1,100 miles from Alaska into the northern Pacific Ocean. The             Aleutians           are volcanic islands, many of them quite active today, and they are             literally sitting on shallow beds of molten rock, surrounded by water.
The U.S. Department of Energy wanted to know if those desolate            islands could be used to produce geothermal energy. The idea was that            the hot areas beneath the surface might provide a continuous source            of blistering hot water, which could in turn be flashed to steam and            used to turn turbines and produce electricity. The precedent had been            set in California and Iceland. California draws a small percentage of            its electricity from geothermal power plants near San Francisco.
Energy for Centuries
So Wescott traveled out the Aleutians, drilling a few test wells            along the way, and he found just what common sense would suggest should            be there. The rocks beneath the surface were very, very hot.

But here's the hitch: Why build power plants hundreds, or thousands,            of miles away from any users? It isn't practical to run power lines            from the Aleutians all the way to the major population centers of the            western United States, so what Wescott really found was an enormous            source of energy where nobody could use it.
So the whole idea kind of died, except in the mind of Gene Wescott...
In recent years, Wescott has returned to the idea of building geothermal            power plants in the Aleutians, and using that electricity to produce            hydrogen. The hydrogen could be liquified, he says,           and shipped to Asia or the west coast of the United States. One of           the           largest geothermal resources he found in his earlier research is near           the major deepwater port of Dutch Harbor, making it almost seem           as though providence planned the whole thing.
