Overview of Geothermal energy
Low Temperature Geothermal
When the term "geothermal" is used in the context of energy the            term tends to engender images of shooting geysers and bubbling lava.  Certainly this type of energy generation known as "High Temperature            Geothermal" exists in many parts of the U.S. and is discussed in            detail in our section on Geothermal Plants.  However, for most            homeowners the most exciting story when it comes to renewable energy            is low temperature geothermal using a type of heating system called a            ground source heat pump. This type of heating leverages the fact that            the temperature of the earth in your front and back yard remains very            stable throughout the year at between 45° - 75° degrees Fahrenheit.  By            leveraging these constant temperatures it is possible to heat and cool            your home geothermally at substantially less cost than you probably do            today.  In an era where natural gas and heating oil prices have            gone through the roof, a ground source heat pump is something that            just about every homeowner ought to consider.
Geothermal energy is a bi-directional energy source that can be            used for both heating and cooling.  When using geothermal energy            for cooling  in the summer heat pumps are used to extract the            hotter air from the house so that it can be cooled in the earth. In            the winter the outside air is colder than the ground temperature and            so the heat exchanger in the heat pump can move the heat from the            ground into the house or building.
Ground source heat pump systems can save you substantial money on            your home heating and cooling bill.  Most studies indicate that            geothermal heating and cooling can lead to savings between 25%-50%            over conventional heating and cooling systems. While they do have an            upfront cost, the payback period is relatively short, between 2-10            years depending upon the installation. Given recent changes in heating            oil and natural gas prices the savings are likely to be even greater            in the future and payback periods even shorter.  For more            information on costs check out the Typical Costs section. Also, there            are federal tax credits available for geothermal heating and many            states provide incentives as well.  You can find information on            incentives in our Incentives section.
In addition to lower cost, ground source heat pumps offer a number            of other advantages over a conventional furnace.  Ground source            heat pumps run on electricity.  This means they are exceptionally            safe.  There is no combustion and no combustion gases such as            methane are released.  This means it is not only safer for you,            it is better for the environment as well.  Heat pumps also tend            to provide a more even heat than traditional furnaces and usually run            much quieter. 
High Temperature Geothermal
The direct use of geothermal heating has been practiced for thousands of years, and direct use continues today.  Many parts of the world, particularly those in the regions which            border the earth's tectonic plates (sometimes called the ring of fire)            have strong access to geothermal sources close to the surface.  In the United States there are extensive geothermal sources in the            west and northwest.  These geothermal sources can be tapped            directly or indirectly and then used for heating buildings, streets or            districts.  The heat is also used in heating spas and pools, in aquaculture and greenhouses, and in various industrial applications.  For information on direct uses of geothermal heating look at our            section on Geothermal Heating in the Geothermal Plants section.
Another use of geothermal energy is electric power generation.  Electric power generation using geothermal resources may take place in several different types of plants, but most rely on the process of piping water or steam into a plant from            an underground heat source.  The steam is used to run a            conventional steam turbine when then generates the electricity.  Because there is no need to use natural gas or oil to heat the water            and create steam, these types of plants can be extremely efficient and            can generate enough electricity to feed thousands and sometimes tens            of thousands of homes. Moreover they do this without adding any            hydrocarbons or pollutants to the atmosphere. For information on            electric generation with geothermal look at our section on Geothermal            Electric in the Geothermal Plants section.
Direct access to geothermal sources and electrical generation            through tapping geothermal sources are often referred to as High            Temperature Geothermal in that they are leveraging extremely high            temperature underground sources.  These sources are usually only            found in specific geological areas adjacent to the earth's tectonic            plates. However,  it is also possible to develop useful energy by            leveraging the differential that exists between air temperature and            ground temperature near the surface.  These types of Low            Temperature Geothermal systems are called Geo-exchange systems, and            constitute a third category of geothermal energy use.
High temperature geothermal energy systems require significant            physical infrastructure and therefore are generally restricted to            large heating or electric plants.  However, low temperature            geothermal exchange systems using heat pumps are much simpler and can            be used by most home or small business owners. They are becoming            increasingly common throughout the United States and Europe and are            one of the most promising renewable energy approaches.
Finding the Best
One of the services we want to provide our EB members is          a listing of Recommended Geothermal Heating Contractors.  If you have used a          heating and cooling contractor to put a ground source heat pump into your home or business and were happy with their          work please provide us their contact info by clicking here and we will do the rest. As soon as we have a sufficient list together          we will publish it on the site.  Thanks! --Editor
Geothermal Facts
As early as 10,000 years ago, Native Americans used hot springs water for cooking and medicine. For centuries the Maoris of New Zealand have cooked "geothermally," and, since the 1960s, France has been heating up to 200,000 homes using geothermal water.
More Facts
In snow covered Idaho they raise alligators using          ponds heated by geothermal energy.
Geothermal Books
Most books on the topic of          geothermal energy are really targeted for energy professionals and are          not of much value to the average consumer.  An exception is the          book Geothermal Heat Pumps by Karl Oschner.  See this book and          others in our book section.
