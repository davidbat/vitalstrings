Two geothermal plants saves a resort owner over $300,000 in electricity costs each year.
Energy Tomorrow
Innovative Geothermal Startup Will Put Carbon Dioxide To Good Use
GreenFire Energy began work to demonstrate a process that would use CO2 to harness geothermal energy to make electricity. What is more, the technology has the potential to add carbon sequestration – not to mention reduced water consumption – to the benefits already associated with geothermal power.
The Neal Hot Springs project will use a first-of-its-kind improved technology, called supercritical binary geothermal cycle.
