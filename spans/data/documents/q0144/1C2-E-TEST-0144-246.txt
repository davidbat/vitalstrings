Answer:
Geothermal energy is heat from underground that is used to make energy.
The earth contains a huge amount of liquid or hot rock at a relatively short distance from the surface. Some of it is welling up now at various points in the world. Hot springs are the result of water seeping into the heated rocks and coming back up hot. In a geothermal power plant water is piped down to the hot area and the returning boiling water is used to produce electricity. It is a fact that lava up welling in the mid-Atlantic is moving Europe and America apart. That is a large amount of geothermal energy at work.
Under Lady island in the Columbia river there is a hot spot. Water is circulated via a pipe through the heated area and returns to run an electric turbine. There are a lot of geothermal sites at ground level. Any "hot springs" or a lot of Yellow stone National Parks wonderful hot springs and geysers.
Long holes are drilled to a length of few kilometers. Water is pumped into the bottom rock. The water will become steam. The force of the steam generates energy. There is a notable geothermal power plant in France.
