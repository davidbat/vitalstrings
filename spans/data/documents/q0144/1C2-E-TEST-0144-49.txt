On 12 July 2011 the U.K. Government published ‘ Planning our electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity ’. Plans to reform energy policy are under debate around the world, e.g. Australia is planning to introduce a carbon tax that doesn't include transport fuels.
Many such policies focus on power plants, at the risk of overlooking the potential for batteries to be charged at off-peak hours and then to feed their surplus power back into the grid when needed most. As you may know, I advocate a comprehensive policy that includes feebates such as fees on fossil fuel and polluting facilities, funding rebates on local transport electrification and clean energy programs.
The image below shows how several fees and rebates can be combined to provide the best local mix of incentives and disincentives, to minimize leakage that would occur with policies that provide either incentives only, or disincentives only, or that focus only on energy, respectively only on facilities and infrastructure that use or produce energy.
Moreover, such feebates can be implemented on a budget-neutral basis, allowing them to be implemented with minimal changes to existing taxes and support programs.
