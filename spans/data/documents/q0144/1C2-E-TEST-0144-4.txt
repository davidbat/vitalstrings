WHAT            DOES THE WORD "GEOTHERMAL" MEAN?
"Geothermal" comes                from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat). So, geothermal                means earth heat.
WHAT IS GEOTHERMAL              ENERGY?
Our earth's interior - like                the sun - provides heat energy from nature. This heat - geothermal                energy - yields warmth and power that we can use without polluting                the environment.
Geothermal heat originates from                Earth's fiery consolidation of dust and gas over 4 billion years                ago. At earth's core - 4,000 miles deep - temperatures may                reach over 9,000 degrees F.
HOW DOES GEOTHERMAL              HEAT GET UP TO EARTH'S SURFACE?
The heat from the earth's core                continuously flows outward. It transfers (conducts) to the surrounding                layer of rock, the mantle. When temperatures and pressures                become high enough, some mantle rock melts, becoming magma.                Then, because it is lighter (less dense) than the surrounding rock,                the magma rises (convects), moving slowly up toward the                earth's crust, carrying the heat from below.
Sometimes the hot magma reaches                all the way to the surface, where we know it as lava. But most often                the magma remains below earth's crust, heating nearby rock and water                (rainwater that has seeped deep into the earth) - sometimes as hot                as 700 degrees F. Some of this hot geothermal water travels back                up through faults and cracks and reaches the earth's surface as hot springs or geysers, but most of it stays deep                underground, trapped in cracks and porous rock. This natural collection                of hot water is called a geothermal reservoir.
HOW HAVE PEOPLE              USED GEOTHERMAL ENERGY IN THE PAST?
From earliest times, people                have used geothermal water that flowed freely from the earth's surface                as hot springs. The oldest and most common use was, of course, just                relaxing in the comforting warm waters. But eventually, this "magic water" was used (and still is) in other creative ways. The                Romans, for example, used geothermal water to treat eye and skin                disease and, at Pompeii, to heat buildings. As early as 10,000 years                ago, Native Americans used hot springs water for cooking and medicine.                For centuries the Maoris of New Zealand have cooked "geothermally," and, since the 1960s, France has been heating up to 200,000 homes                using geothermal water.
HOW DO WE              USE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY TODAY?
Today we drill wells into the                geothermal reservoirs to bring the hot water to the surface. Geologists,                geochemists, drillers and engineers do a lot of exploring and testing                to locate underground areas that contain this geothermal water,                so we'll know where to drill geothermal production wells.                Then, once the hot water and/or steam travels up the wells to the                surface, they can be used to generate electricity in geothermal                power plants or for energy saving non-electrical purposes.
HOW IS ELECTRICITY              GENERATED USING GEOTHERMAL ENERGY?
In geothermal power plants steam, heat or hot water from geothermal reservoirs provides the                force that spins the turbine generators and produces electricity.                The used geothermal water is then returned down an injection                well into the reservoir to be reheated, to maintain pressure,                and to sustain the reservoir.
There are three kinds of geothermal                power plants. The kind we build depends on the temperatures                and pressures of a reservoir.
A "dry'" steam                  reservoir produces steam but very little water. The steam is piped                  directly into a "dry" steam power plant to provide                  the force to spin the turbine generator. The largest dry steam                  field in the world is The Geysers, about 90 miles north of San                  Francisco. Production of electricity started at The Geysers in                  1960, at what has become the most successful alternative energy                  project in history.
A geothermal reservoir that                  produces mostly hot water is called a "hot water reservoir" and is used in a "flash" power plant. Water ranging                  in temperature from 300 - 700 degrees F is brought up to the surface                  through the production well where, upon being released from the                  pressure of the deep reservoir, some of the water flashes into                  steam in a 'separator.' The steam then powers the turbines.
A reservoir with temperatures                  between 250 - 360 degrees F is not hot enough to flash enough                  steam but can still be used to produce electricity in a "binary" power plant. In a binary system the geothermal water is passed                  through a heat exchanger, where its heat is transferred                  into a second (binary) liquid, such as isopentane, that boils                  at a lower temperature than water. When heated, the binary liquid                  flashes to vapor, which, like steam, expands across and spins                  the turbine blades. The vapor is then recondensed to a liquid                  and is reused repeatedly. In this closed loop cycle, there are                  no emissions to the air.
WHAT ARE SOME              OF THE ADVANTAGES OF USING GEOTHERMAL ENERGY TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY?
Clean.                Geothermal power plants, like wind and solar power plants, do not                have to burn fuels to manufacture steam to turn the turbines. Generating                electricity with geothermal energy helps to conserve nonrenewable                fossil fuels, and by decreasing the use of these fuels, we reduce                emissions that harm our atmosphere. There is no smoky air around                geothermal power plants -- in fact some are built in the middle                of farm crops and forests, and share land with cattle and local                wildlife.
For ten years, Lake County California, home to five geothermal electric                power plants, has been the first and only county to meet the most                stringent governmental air quality standards in the U.S.
Easy on the                land. The land area                required for geothermal power plants is smaller per megawatt than                for almost every other type of power plant. Geothermal installations                don't require damming of rivers or harvesting of forests -- and                there are no mine shafts, tunnels, open pits, waste heaps or oil                spills.
Reliable. Geothermal power plants are designed to run 24 hours a day, all                year. A geothermal power plant sits right on top of its fuel source.                It is resistant to interruptions of power generation due to weather,                natural disasters or political rifts that can interrupt transportation                of fuels.
Flexible.                Geothermal power plants can have modular designs, with additional                units installed in increments when needed to fit growing demand                for electricity.
Keeps Dollars                at Home. Money does                not have to be exported to import fuel for geothermal power plants.                Geothermal "fuel'" - like the sun and the wind - is always                where the power plant is; economic benefits remain in the region                and there are no fuel price shocks.
Helps Developing                Countries Grow. Geothermal                projects can offer all of the above benefits to help developing                countries grow without pollution. And installations in remote locations                can raise the standard of living and quality of life by bringing electricity to people far from "electrified" population                centers.
HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY              IS FROM GEOTHERMAL ENERGY?
Since the first geothermally-generated                electricity in the world was produced at Larderello, Italy, in 1904                the use of geothermal energy for electricity has grown worldwide                to about 7,000 megawatts in twenty-one countries around the                world. The United States alone produces 2700 megawatts of electricity                from geothermal energy, electricity comparable to burning sixty                million barrels of oil each year.
WHAT ARE SOME              NON-ELECTRIC WAYS WE CAN USE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY?
Geothermal water is used around                the world, even when it is not hot enough to generate electricity.                Anytime geothermal water or heat are used directly, less electricity                is used. Using geothermal water 'directly' conserves energy and replaces the use of polluting energy resources with clean                ones. The main non-electric ways we use geothermal energy are                DIRECT USES and GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS.
DIRECT USES Geothermal waters ranging from 50 degrees F to over 300 degrees F,              are used directly from the earth:
'to soothe aching                muscles in hot springs, and health spas (balneology);
to help grow flowers,                vegetables, and other crops in greenhouses while snow-drifts pile                up outside (agriculture);
to shorten the                time needed for growing fish, shrimp, abalone and alligators to                maturity (aquaculture);
to pasteurize milk,                to dry onions and lumber and to wash wool (industrial uses);
Space heating of individual buildings and of entire districts, is - besides hot                spring bathing - the most common and the oldest direct use of nature's                hot water. Geothermal district heating systems pump geothermal                water through a heat exchanger, where it transfers its heat to clean city water that is piped to buildings in the district.                There, a second heat exchanger transfers the heat to the building's                heating system. The geothermal water is injected down a well back                into the reservoir to be heated and used again. The first modern                district heating system was developed in Boise, Idaho. (In the western                U.S. there are 271 communities with geothermal resources available                for this use.) Modern district heating systems also serve homes                in Russia, China, France, Sweden, Hungary, Romania, and Japan. The                world's largest district heating system is in Reykjavik, Iceland. Since it started using geothermal energy as its main source of heat                Reykjavik, once very polluted, has become one of the cleanest cities                in the world.
Geothermal heat is being used in some creative ways; its use is                limited only by our ingenuity. For example, in Klamath Falls, Oregon,                which has one of the largest district heating systems in the U.S.,                geothermal water is also piped under roads and sidewalks to keep                them from icing over in freezing weather. The cost of using any                other method to keep hot water running continuously through cold                pipes would be prohibitive. And in New Mexico and other places rows                of pipes carrying geothermal water have been installed under soil,                where flowers or vegetables are growing. This ensures that the ground                does not freeze, providing a longer growing season and overall faster                growth of agricultural products that are not protected by the shelter                and warmth of a greenhouse.
GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS Animals have always known to burrow into the earth, where the temperature              is relatively stable compared to the air temperature, to get shelter              from winter's cold and summer's heat. People, too, have sought relief              from bad weather in earth's caves. Today, with geothermal heat pumps              (GHP's), we take advantage of this stable earth temperature - about              45 - 58 degrees F just a few feet below the surface - to help keep              our indoor temperatures comfortable. GHP's circulate water or other              liquids through pipes buried in a continuous loop (either horizontally              or vertically) next to a building. Depending on the weather, the system              is used for heating or cooling.
Heating:                Earth's heat (the difference between the earth's temperature and                the colder temperature of the air) is transferred through the buried                pipes into the circulating liquid and then transferred again into                the building.
Cooling:                During hot weather, the continually circulating fluid in the pipes                'picks up' heat from the building - thus helping to cool it - and                transfers it into the earth.
GHP's use very little electricity              and are very easy on the environment.
In the U.S., the temperature inside              over 300,000 homes, schools and offices is kept comfortable by these              energy saving systems, and hundreds of thousands more are used worldwide.              The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rated GHP's as among              the most efficient of heating and cooling technologies.
WHAT PARTS              OF THE WORLD HAVE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY?
( Geothermal                Worldwide )
For electricity                and direct use:                Geothermal reservoirs that are close enough to the surface to be                reached by drilling can occur in places where geologic processes                have allowed magma to rise up through the crust, near to the surface,                or where it flows out as lava. The crust of the Earth is made up                of huge plates, which are in constant but very slow motion relative                to one another. Magma can reach near the surface in three main geologic                areas:
where Earth's large oceanic                    and crustal plates collide and one slides beneath another, called                    a subduction zone The best example of these hot regions around                    plate margins is the Ring of Fire -- the areas bordering the                    Pacific Ocean: the South American Andes, Central America, Mexico,                    the Cascade Range of the U.S. and Canada, the Aleutian Range                    of Alaska, the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia, Japan, the Philippines,                    Indonesia and New Zealand.
spreading centers, where                    these plates are sliding apart, (such as Iceland, the rift valleys                    of Africa, the mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Basin and Range Province                    in the U.S.); and
places called hot spots--                    fixed points in the mantle that continually produce magma to                    the surface. Because the plate is continually moving across                    the hot spot, strings of volcanoes are formed, such as the chain                    of Hawaiian Islands.
The countries currently producing the most electricity from                    geothermal reservoirs are the United States, New Zealand, Italy,                    Iceland, Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia and Japan, but geothermal                    energy is also being used in many other countries.
For geothermal                heat pumps, use                can be almost world-wide. The earth's temperature a few feet below                the ground surface is relatively constant everywhere in the world                (about 45 - 58 degrees F), while the air temperature can change                from summer to winter extremes. Unlike other kinds of geothermal                heat, shallow ground temperatures are not dependent upon tectonic                plate activity or other unique geologic processes. Thus geothermal                heat pumps can be used to help heat and cool homes anywhere.
HOW MUCH              GEOTHERMAL ENERGY IS THERE?
Thousands more megawatts of                power than are currently being produced could be developed from                already-identified hydrothermal resources. With improvements                in technology, much more power will become available. Usable                geothermal resources will not be limited to the "shallow" hydrothermal reservoirs at the crustal plate boundaries. Much of                the world is underlain (3-6 miles down), by hot dry rock - no water, but lots of heat. Scientists in the U.S.A., Japan, England,                France, Germany and Belgium have experimented with piping water                into this deep hot rock to create more hydrothermal resources for                use in geothermal power plants. As drilling technology improves,                allowing us to drill much deeper, geothermal energy from hot dry                rock could be available anywhere. At such time, we will be able                to tap the true potential of the enormous heat resources of the                earth's crust.
