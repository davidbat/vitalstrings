Geothermal Energy
Geothermal resources range from shallow ground to hot water and rock several miles below the Earth's surface, and even further down to the extremely hot molten rock called magma. Wells over 1 mile deep can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought to the surface for use in a variety of applications.
Geothermal power requires no fuel, and is therefore virtually emissions free and insusceptible to fluctuations in fuel cost. And because a geothermal power station doesn't rely on transient sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind turbines or solar panels, its capacity factor can be quite large; up to 90% in practice.
Geothermal Energy Facts
Geothermal energy is sustainable because hot water can be re-injected into the ground.
Geothermal energy can be found in the form of volcanoes, hot springs and geysers.
Geothermal energy has three main uses: Heating, Electricity generation and Geothermal heat pumps.
Geothermal energy's amount of electricity is less than 1 percent of total electricity produced in the USA.
