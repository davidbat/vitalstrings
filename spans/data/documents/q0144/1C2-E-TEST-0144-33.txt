Geothermal Energy In Michigan
Geothermal systems have been used for more than 40 years in Michigan, and millions of units have been installed world-wide in both commercial and residential applications.  A geothermal heat pump is the most energy-efficient and environmentally  friendly HVAC system currently available.  In fact, the system is so efficient that it
can pay for itself in savings in only 3-5 years.  Geothermal systems are also eligible
for federal tax credits and state incentives.
Even with the extremes of our Michigan climate a geothermal heat pump can heat or cool on demand, and therefore has the ability to keep your
entire house comfortable year-round and provide better humidity control.  All Bosch GeoThermal systems
can be easily adapted to zoned systems, providing even greater comfort year-round throughout the whole house.
