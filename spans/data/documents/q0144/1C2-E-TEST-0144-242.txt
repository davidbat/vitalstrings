Geothermal Training
Geothermal systems are an increasingly popular way to provide energy to homes and other buildings thanks to their consistent energy output over seasons, their extremely low maintenance requirements, and an increasingly affordable upfront cost due to multiple incentives provided by federal and local programs.
A ground source heat pump has a 50 year life expectancy, and provides about 70% of the energy needed to heat and cool a building, allowing the building owner freedom from future energy pricing shocks.The International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA) certifies our training courses.
