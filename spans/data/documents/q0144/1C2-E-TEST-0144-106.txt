Geothermal Energy
The word "geothermal" is derived from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat), and "energy" is defined as usable power, such as       heat or electricity. The temperature at the Earth's core (6,437       kilometers or 4,000 miles deep) may exceed 4,980°C (9,000°F).       Energy from the Earth's interior, in the form of heat, constantly       flows outward. Upwelling of hot mantle material to shallower depths and lower pressure produces melting, forming       a magma (molten rock) that is less dense than the mantle material from       which it was derived. This less dense magma rises slowly through the       mantle to the Earth's crust. If the magma reaches the       Earth's surface, it is called lava.
If magma remains beneath the Earth's surface within the crust, the       heat energy is released slowly over time to the local and even regional       area. This residual heat energy transfers to adjacent rock and groundwater , heating them to temperatures exceeding 370°C (700°F). Most of       this heat energy remains stored in the Earth's depths, creating       geothermal reservoirs. Some heat energy from the geothermal reservoirs       transfers to deep-circulating groundwater, and the superheated water       travels to the Earth's surface via faults and fractures, creating geysers and hot springs .
High-temperature geothermal resources (temperatures greater than       150°C, or 302°F) are primarily found in volcanic regions and       island chains, whereas low-temperature geothermal resources (temperatures       less than 100°C, or 212°F) are found throughout the world and on       all continents. Worldwide, high-temperature resources usually are found in tectonic settings associated with volcanism , such as the Pacific Rim (the so-called "Ring of Fire") * and in Iceland. In the United States, energy use associated with       geothermal reservoirs takes place primarily in the western states and       Hawaii, which are areas of geologically recent volcanism.
Using Geothermal Energy
From prehistoric times, humans have utilized the geothermal energy that         flows freely from underground reservoirs to the Earth's surface.         The Romans used geothermal water to treat various diseases as well as to         heat the city of Pompeii. Native North Americans used geothermal water         for cooking and medicinal purposes for more than 10,000 years, and the         Maoris of New Zealand have cooked geothermally for centuries. Ancient         records in Iceland mention the use of geothermal springs for washing and         bathing.
Today, geothermal energy is utilized in three technology categories:
Heating and cooling buildings via geothermal heat pumps that utilize           shallow sources;
Heating structures with direct-use applications; and
Generating electricity through indirect use.
Heat Pumps.
Most areas of the world are suitable for geothermal heat pumps; hence,         there is a great potential for future worldwide use of heat-pump         technology. Geothermal heat pumps take advantage of the fact that a         majority of the Earth's upper 3 meters (less than 10 feet)         maintain temperatures ranging from 10 to 15.5°C (50 to 60°F).
A geothermal pump system consists of pipes buried horizontally in the         upper 3 meters adjacent to a building and then tied into the         structure's ventilation system by simply using the subsurface as         a heat exchanger. A liquid passed through the pipes picks up residual         underground heat in winter, then delivers it to the building, thus         warming it. In summer, the liquid transfers heat from the building to         the ground, thus cooling the building.
Direct Use.
Direct-use applications utilize groundwater that has been heated to         generally less than 100°C (212°F). Direct use of geothermal         energy can supply heat for industrial processes, and can boost         agricultural and aquaculture production in cold climates by heating         greenhouses, soils, and aquaculture ponds. Geothermal uses also include         hot spring and spa bathing, as well as residential and regional         (district) heating.
Direct uses annually provide 11,000 thermal megawatts of power         worldwide. In Reykjavik, Iceland, more than 95 percent of the buildings         are heated with geothermal water pumped from deep wells. The city of         Klamath Falls, Oregon (USA) heats 35 percent of all residential         dwellings and also heats most downtown sidewalks in the winter.
Electricity Generation.
High-temperature geothermal resources almost always are used for power         production. Although geothermal energy has been used throughout history,         the indirect generation of electricity is relatively
The Blue Lagoon near Grindavik, Iceland is a mineral-rich thermal             lake created by the nearby Svartsengi geothermal power plant. The             plant pumps superheated brine from 2 kilometers beneath the             Earth's crust to supply electricity and hot water to the             surrounding area, and discharges relatively "cooled" (but still warm) water to the lagoon. The turquoise blue,             mineralrich waters of almost 40°C (104°F) are a popular             tourist attraction. Some bathers spread silica-containing foam or             mud on their skin.
new. Wells are drilled into known geothermal reservoirs where         temperatures often exceed 360°C (680°F). Steam or super-heated         water is brought to the surface under its own pressure where the energy,         in the form of steam, is utilized to turn the turbines of an electrical         generator.
Three types of geothermal power plants are operating today:
Dry steam plants, which directly use geothermal steam to turn           turbines;
Flash steam plants, which pull deep, high-pressure hot water into           lower-pressure tanks and use the resulting flashed steam to drive           turbines; and
Binary-cycle plants, which pass (in separate piping) moderately hot           geothermal water by a secondary fluid with a much lower boiling point           than water. This causes the secondary fluid to flash to steam, which           then drives the turbines.
Geothermal electric power generation is a proven technology that is         significant in nations with no indigenous fossil fuel resources. Moreover, it is a renewable energy source and one that is         considered cleaner than fossil fuel (e.g., geothermal power plants emit         less carbon dioxide). Worldwide, geothermal energy produced 7,500         megawatts in 21 countries (mostly developing) in 2000, serving 60         million people. The United States produced 3,000 megawatts from         geothermal power plants, supplying about 4 million people.
Environmental Considerations.
Comparatively speaking, geothermal energy is more "environmentally friendly" than fossil fuels or nuclear         fission. However, emissions of carbon dioxide gas and smaller amounts of         hydrogen sulfide accompany the geothermal fluids extracted from wells.         Moreover, hot brine liberated by drilling must be carefully managed to prevent         environmental damage and potential human health impacts.
The super-heated nature of geothermal fluids creates a hazard to             animals and humans. This sign at a geothermal power plant in             California (sited on a geyser field) warns visitors to use caution.
To prevent ground subsidence (sinking) caused by the extraction of         geothermal fluids from their underground reserves, waste brines often         are reinjected into the well. Reinjection must be done carefully to         avoid contaminating potable (drinkable) groundwater supplies.         Above-ground disposal of waste brine also must be managed to avoid         contamination of seas and waterways.
As more geothermal resources are exploited for their         electricity-producing capabilities, it will become increasingly         important to control carbon dioxide emissions and properly manage waste         brines and other byproducts of mining and power production.
