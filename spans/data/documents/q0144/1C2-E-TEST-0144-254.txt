GeoThermal Training
Our geothermal courses will enable you to enter this quickly growing clean energy market by teaching you both the fundamental theory and the practice of designing and installing ground source heat pump systems.
Geothermal systems are an increasingly popular way to provide energy to homes and other buildings thanks to their consistent energy output over seasons, their extremely low maintenance requirements, and an increasingly affordable upfront cost due to multiple incentives provided by federal and local programs.
GSHPs rely on the constant temperature below the Earth's surface to transfer heat into buildings in the winter, and out of buildings in the summer. Not to be confused with large-scale geothermal systems, ground source heat pumps are localized to a building or small group of buildings.
A ground source heat pump has a 50 year life expectancy, and provides about 70% of the energy needed to heat and cool a building, providing a steady and reliable energy source and allowing the building owner freedom from future energy pricing shocks.
The International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA) certifies our training courses, which are taught by industry veterans, and will allow you to offer this great service to your clients.
