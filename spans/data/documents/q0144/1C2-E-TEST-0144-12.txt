Project Spotlight:
Predicting Stimulation Response Relationships
Lawrence Livermore National Lab is developing a computational test bed to produce realistic models of engineered geothermal system (EGS) stimulation‐response scenarios, and successfully modeled a 10% enhancement in a stimulated fracture network.

Enhanced Geothermal Systems basics
DOE estimates that the application of EGS technology is capable of providing at least 100,000 MW of electricity within 50 years.

Geothermal Data Systems
To support geothermal development, the Geothermal Technologies Program collects geothermal data, conducts analyses and maintains this information in the National Geothermal Data System.
More Information
The Geothermal Technologies Program (GTP) works in partnership with industry, academia, and DOE's national laboratories to establish geothermal energy as an economically competitive contributor to the U.S. energy supply.
