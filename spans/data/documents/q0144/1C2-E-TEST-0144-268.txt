Geothermal Energy --      Interesting Facts
Last Updated on:  11/30/2010 06:45 AM
The origin of the word "Geothermal" is Greek.  It comes from "geo" which means "earth" and "therme" which is translated "heat".
Geothermal energy ultimately                comes from radioactive decay in the core of the Earth, which heats                the Earth from the inside out, and from the sun, which heats the                surface.
Volcanoes and geysers are                examples of geothermal energy.
The ancient Romans used                geothermal energy to heat water in their bathhouses for centuries.                They also used the water to treat illnesses and heat homes.
The first geothermal power plant                was started in 1904 in Larderello, Italy. It is still in operation                today.
Geothermal energy comes from the                center of the earth. Its interior heat continual flows  outwards towards the surface
In 1864, a hotel in Oregon                heated rooms using geothermal energy from underground hot springs.
The first geothermal power plant                opened in California in 1921.
A professor at Ohio State                University invented the first geothermal heating system in 1948.
Geothermal electricity is clean                - no fossil fuels are burned.

Geothermal Energy (Tibet) : Geothermal power plants do have some environmental impacts. However, these impacts should be balanced against geothermal energy’s advantages over                conventional power sources when conducting assessments of power plant project environmental impacts. The primary impacts of geothermal plant construction and energy production are                gaseous emissions, land use, noise, and potential ground subsidence.
History Of Geothermal : Understanding geothermal energy begins with an understanding of the source of this energy—the                earth’s internal heat. The Earth’s temperature increases with depth, with the temperature at the center reaching more than 4200 °C (7600 °F). A portion of this heat is a relic of the                planet’s formation about 4.5 billion years ago, and a portion is generated by the continuing decay of radioactive isotopes. Heat naturally moves from hotter to cooler regions, so Earth’s                heat flows from its interior toward the surface
