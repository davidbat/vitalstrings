Geothermal energy is nothing new. It’s been used by civilizations throughout history for heating, medicinal purposes, bathing and cooking. With today’s technology, clean, renewable energy from geothermal resources can be used by APS customers to stabilize and reduce their energy costs and increase energy independence.
Only systems installed within APS territory are eligible for these incentives.

What is geothermal energy?
Geothermal energy uses the heat (“thermal”) that is contained inside the earth (“geo”). Different technologies can be used to extract that heat and then use it to create electricity, to warm water or to provide heat to your home or business.
Commercially, geothermal energy is currently being used in Arizona in various locations in a diverse number of applications such as aquaculture operations raising fish and shrimp, crop irrigation, spas, greenhouse heating, grain and vegetable drying, soil warming for mushroom growing and earthworm farms.
For residential customers geothermal energy is typically used to provide home heat or cooling and can be used as an energy source to help heat water.
Will Geothermal work for me?

What steps do I need to take?
One of the first things you can do is to speak with an industry professional who can discuss different geothermal energy applications that can work for your particular situation. The process to reserve funding is slightly different depending on how you are using geothermal resources.
