Geothermal
The upper 10 feet of the Earth maintains a temperature between 50° and 60°F. The ground temperature is warmer than the air above in the winter and cooler than the air in the summer. Geothermal energy taps the heat that lies beneath the earth's surface in several ways. 
People can use the geothermal reservoirs of hot water and steam to generate electricity and for direct applications, including aquaculture, crop drying, and district heating. They can also use the constant temperature that exists at very shallow depths for heating and cooling buildings with the energy-efficiency technology of ground-source heat pumps.
Geothermal heat pumps take advantage of this resource to heat and cool buildings.
