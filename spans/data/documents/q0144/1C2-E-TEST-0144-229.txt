Geothermal Energy
Alaska’s  geologic and tectonic history has produced substantial geothermal resources  throughout the state. Recognized geothermal resources are concentrated in three  regions: 1) within the “Ring of Fire,” the volcanic arc that circles the  Pacific and includes the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, and Wrangell  Mountains; 2) a band of hot springs in central Alaska extending from the Seward  Peninsula east to the Canadian border; and 3) the Southeast Hot Springs.
In 2006 Chena  Hot Springs installed a 400 kW geothermal power plant with the assistance  of AEA's Denali Commission-funded Energy Cost Reduction program. The first  commercial geothermal project in the state, the project displaces approximately  160,700 gallons of diesel per year.
Through  the Renewable Energy Fund, AEA is currently funding geothermal exploration and  development projects at Manley Hot Springs and at Hot Springs Bay Valley on the  island of Akutan.  Additionally, the city  of Juneau has received funding for the design and construction of two ground  source heat pumps: one at the airport and the other at the Dimond Aquatic  Center.
Despite  Alaska’s significant geothermal potential, the attributes of Alaska’s  geothermal resources remain poorly defined. AEA is involved in several task  forces to better understand and develop these resources. These include: 1)  coordinating a statewide Geothermal Working Group of industry, academic, and  government officials interested in geothermal development; 2) participating in  the U.S. Department of Energy's Geopowering the  West program, which provides technical and financial support for western  U.S. states; and 3) collaborating with the Alaska DNR Division of Geological  and Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) to compile geothermal data throughout Alaska.
