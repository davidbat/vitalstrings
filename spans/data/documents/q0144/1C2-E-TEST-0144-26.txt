 Geothermal                                Energy 
Geothermal                                  energy is a form of renewable energy derived from                                  heat deep in the earth’s crust. This heat is brought                                  to the near-surface by thermal conduction and                                  by intrusion into the earth's crust of molten                                  magma originating from great depth. As groundwater                                  is heated, geothermal energy is produced in the                                  form of hot water and steam. The heated groundwater                                  can be used for direct heating of homes and greenhouses,                                  for vegetable drying, and for a number of other                                  uses. These are known as direct uses of geothermal                                  energy.
Geothermal                                  energy is also used for electricity production.                                  Geothermal power generation is used today throughout                                  the world where good geothermal resources exist,                                  including many locations in the western United                                  States. The REPP Geothermal Issue Brief on this                                  page provides a general background on the fundamentals                                  of geothermal power, including discussions of                                  the technical, economic, and policy dimensions                                  of geothermal power worldwide. Economic data and                                  current U.S. geothermal policy help illustrate                                  the concepts of the issue brief. Extensive references                                  to reports and Internet links to the latest developments                                  in geothermal power’s role in clean energy generation                                  are included.
