Today, Nicaragua produces electric power by burning oil and coal. Tomorrow (or, at least in the not-too-distant future), the small Central American nation intends to tap the chain of volcanoes it sits above as a source of geothermal energy.
Polaris Energy Nicaragua, S.A. has received more than $30 million in funding from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to expand the capacity of the San Jacinto geothermal power plant in the western part of Nicaragua from an existing 10 MW generating unit to a total of 72 MW. Currently, Nicaragua’s private sector provides more than 40% of the nation’s energy.
Geothermal heat generates cheap, clean electric power, but requires a steep upfront commitment of capital to tap. These high “first costs” have hampered efforts to develop geothermal resources in Nicaragua.
“This project is not just about expanding access to electricity,” Hans Schulz, General Manager of the Structured and Corporate Finance Department of the IDB, said in a press release. “It is also about transforming the country’s energy matrix to reduce its dependence on fossil fuel imports and boost its long term competitiveness.”
Geothermal power plants turn hot water into steam or vapor to run a turbine and generate electricity, after which the water is injected back into the underground geothermal reservoir. Geothermal power plants do not require fuel, are largely unaffected by weather and use a comparatively small share of the land and freshwater needed for most other energy facilities. Best of all, geothermal plants provide power 24 hours a day, 7 days per week and thus are among the few sources of renewable energy that can replace baseload plants powered by fossil fuels.
