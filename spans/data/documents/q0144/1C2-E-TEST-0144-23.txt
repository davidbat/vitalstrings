Geothermal
Use the constant temperature of the earth for heating and cooling with money-saving geothermal technology.
Geothermal is based on a simple premise: Below the frost line - usually about six feet deep â€“ the earth is a constant temperature of about 50 degrees Fahrenheit all year long.
During the winter, the system absorbs heat from the ground and uses it to warm the air in your home. In the warmer summer months, the processed is reversed, taking heat from your home and transferring it back into the ground.
