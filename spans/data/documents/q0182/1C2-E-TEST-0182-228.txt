Yawning and Why Do People Yawn
Who remembers the last time you yawned? Were you looking at a total stranger? Why did you automatically yawn after seeing a stranger yawn? Did you just yawn? No problem. Actually,  there is no research that provides us with concrete reasons why yawning occurs in people and animals. It just happens.
Some scientists advocate yawning is part of a automatic response system  called the " mirror neuron system." From a technical point of view that means special brain cells are triggered when we see or are in the view of a person who yawns. Some people believe yawning is contagious. Well that theory has not yet  been proved or disapproved. We only know a picture, a person or even a  movie can cause us to yawn without thinking about it. This is true, yawning  is both voluntary and involuntary. It is mostly an automatic response.

Dopamine is a neuro-transmitter that affects sleep, mood, attention and other emotions. Glutamic acid is important for cognitive skills such as learning and memory. Nitric acid helps inhibit mental disorders.
