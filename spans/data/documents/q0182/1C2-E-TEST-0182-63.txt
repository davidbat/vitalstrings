When we are tired, our breathing becomes more shallow. This causes a lack of oxygen, and a build up of carbon-dioxide in our lungs. These levels trigger us to yawn. When doing so, we refresh our lungs and take in an extra amount of oxygen. When asleep we don't need much oxygen to function, so we only yawn when getting tired or waking up.
