It seems that when other people yawn we like to yawn too. We yawn in many different situations such as when tired but we can also do it when weâ€™re very active like when exercising. Some of us do is after eating and some even yawn when we sing but why do we yawn so much in 2011?
Why do we yawn so much?
Is it our busy schedules and a need to get more precious oxygen to our brains or are we influenced by the actions of others?
