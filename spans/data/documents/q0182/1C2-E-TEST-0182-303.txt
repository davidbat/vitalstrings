I would definitely check it out with your vet.
Hmmmmmm....that's interesting. Very good thought. Sounds like your problem might be worth a call to the vet for a little advice.
My other thought: In Stanley Coren's book "How to Speak Dog", all body language is explained.  Yawns are a simple sign of stress or anxiety; they may also be used to diffuse a threat.  In human language, it means "I'm a bit tense right now"
It sounds like Meg is doing it too much for THAT explanation; however, my own dogs both yawn a lot after a wild game of wrestling, or if they're waiting on dinner and I'm taking too long, or I'm a bit late getting them outside when they ask to go, etc etc.   My Maggie is a hound who doesn't like to be overly loved on (unless it's her idea); I notice she yawns a lot when it's MY idea to grab her and kiss/pet on her....she yawns the entire time until I'm done, then jumps down and shakes all over as if to say "sheesh, that's ENOUGH mom!!"
