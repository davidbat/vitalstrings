CNN and the Truth: It's Nothing to Yawn About
A BUZZFLASH EDITORIAL
If there is television news programming that operates independently           of the White House spin-of-the-day, please let us know.
Let's just look at a few recent examples of the Karl Rove television         news media stenographic pool at work.
After                 David Letterman aired a videotape of Tyler Crotty, 13 and the         son of a Bush $100,000 plus "Pioneer" fundraiser, fighting         to stay awake as George droned on and on, CNN host Daryn Kagan dismissed         the videotape with the following on-air comment: "We're being told         by the White House that the kid, as funny as he was, was edited into         that video, which would explain why the people around him weren't really         reacting." CNN anchor Kyra Phillips later reran the tape but cautioned         viewers: "We're told that the kid was there at that event, but not         necessarily standing behind the president." [ LINK ]
Accused of misleading his viewers, Letterman called the White House         a bunch of liars. (Hey, Dave, we've been doing that for four years. So,         don't think you're breaking any new ground here.)
And what do you know? CNN did a sudden turnabout, claiming that the         Bush propaganda machine never really called them at all. They vaguely         attributed the unfounded allegation to news staff error.
"This             whole thing just smells. Doesn't it smell a little bit?" Letterman         remarked on his show after the CNN retreat. [ LINK ]
Here's our BuzzFlash question. Does anyone really believe that the         CNN staff ACCIDENTALLY made up a story about the White House calling         and telling CNN that the bored boy was spliced in? Come on now.
What we have here is the distinct possibility, although we can't prove         it, that the White House called CNN to try and discredit Letterman. CNN         ran with the White House tip, which was brazenly a lie. Letterman then         called the White House spinmeisters a bunch of liars on the air. The         White House then called CNN and told them that they would prefer that         their fingerprints weren't on the original discrediting lie. Then CNN         suddenly makes fun of the whole episode and says that the White House         didn't ring them up after all.
If you accept this scenario, then a major news broadcaster in the United         States lied about a lie, twice. They accepted the White House lie, which         appeared ludicrous to begin with, and then lied about the White House         peddling the lie to them. Is there any doubt now, if this is what happened,         that CNN is just another White House propaganda outlet?
And             if you think that these theories about the main stream press being         lapdogs for the Bush Cartel are a bit on the fringe, then how do you         explain this hiring at NBC: "Anna Perez, who recently directed communications         at the National Security Council, will become chief communications executive         for NBC, the network announced yesterday."
You read that right. The press flack for the Bush Cartel liar of the         month, Condoleezza Rice, did such a good job at handling the dissembling         of our National Security Advisor, NBC figured she could do the same thing         for them.
Is             this for real? Yes, we don't make this stuff up. [ LINK ]
Then there's the daily Bush propaganda megaphone known as FOX News.         The day Richard Clarke was to appear before the 9/11 Commission, FOX         released to Commission members a briefing that Clarke gave to selected         reporters a year ago. FOX was, as a news organization, directly attempting         to undermine Clarke's testimony. Say what? A news organization taking         an active role in protecting the partisan lying underbelly of the Bush         Cartel by becoming actively INVOLVED in trying to discredit a witness         before the 9/11 Commission?
No fringe theories here. Just the facts.
If             that weren't enough, we learned this weekend that Republican operatives         are in charge of the American government press operation in Iraq. As         our soldiers and mercenaries are slaughtered, GOP dissemblers do damage         control as they feed "good news" stories (or make them up)         to the colluding mainstream press.

Karl Rove knows that American presidential elections are won and lost         on television. The party that can control the spin and the images on         the tube is the party that will win in November. Television is the spigot         through which the information and subconscious messages that define the         candidates are released.
That             is why the Republican National Committee is going to court to try             and suppress 527s, like MoveOn.Org, from airing ads. In an effort         to bypass the FEC, which will likely put the kibosh on the 527s anyway,         the RNC is so concerned about the impact of the anti-Bush ads that they         want the courts to stop them immediately. The RNC calls the ads -- and         don't laugh, this is too serious -- "An unprecedented criminal enterprise         designed to impermissibly affect a presidential election." [ LINK ]
In             a recent interview in "Le Figaro," author and Bush critic         John Le Carre commented (per the BuzzFlash translation from the French)         about the French release of his novel "Absolute Friends": "The         gravest sin in my eyes is the corruption of the truth, and this is what         I address in my book. The majority of people in the United States have         absolutely no chance of finding out what the truth really is. It matters         little that some courageous journalists have tried. The truth is simply         not able to penetrate the [media] system that exists."
We have crossed over the threshold into an Orwellian media, where lies         are truth -- and the truth tellers are labeled as liars.
There is a point where Soviet-era control of the media and one-party         corporate control of the media merge into the same product: government         news that goes unchallenged, particularly on television.
Liberals             and progressives often underestimate the impact of television news,             political ads and satire on the average American voter. That is         because many of them "look down" on television as boorish.         Karl Rove doesn't bother to sneer, however; he just plays television         like a concert violinist.
"The             majority of people in the United States have absolutely no chance             of finding out what the truth really is," John Le Carre         warns.
One need only turn on television news to know how desperately right         he is.
