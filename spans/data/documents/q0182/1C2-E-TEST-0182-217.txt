Being a former music student, I'm wondering if the diaphragm breathing method isn't being utilized.
When you use more breath than you're taking in, you tend to want ot (or do) yawn. Why? I don't know. But proper breathing helps.
Practice. Breathe in very deep while resting a hand on your diaphragm. Make your diaphragm go down as you expand your lungs. Imagine the air filling up the absolute bottom part of your lungs. After a while, the yawn reflex is much easier to control and occurs less often.
Now, let the sex jokes begin.
