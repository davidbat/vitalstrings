News reports say that rain can trigger autism. Is that true?

Of course, if it’s a boring lecture you may just find that everyone else is yawning. But, more worryingly, what if someone is playing this mind game on you and you yawn at just the wrong time? You could end up being “wooed” unwittingly yourself”

Jo-Bob, you need to go back and read worldscience.net’s report. It specifically states it has nothing to do with mirror neurons.
Specifically stated, “Mirror neurons typically become active when a person consciously imitates an action of someone else, a process associated with learning. But they seem to play no role in yawn contagiousness.”
You have to read after the BUT part. They offer theories on it but have no conclusive answer.

I always wondered why I yawned when someone else yawned. I am amiable.  Strangely though, I have been made to yawn without seeing or hearing the other person. It’s some other force that can’t be explained. To common to be coincidence.  Try it. Yawn while staring at someone that does’nt see you. they will yawn too.  I’m yawning right now. You will kyawn while reading this.  1am , good night.

Did the videos have sound?  Was there a test of just the sounds but no images?  The presence of both may have implications but I do remember someone saying that he was asking “who’s yawing in the back seat because it’s making me yawn?”

one of my lecturers says that we probably yawn so that we recirculate the fliuds in hte thoracic cavity which apparently sink (gravity)..so when you’ve been stationary for too long sitting or standing ..you yawn
