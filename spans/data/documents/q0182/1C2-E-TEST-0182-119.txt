Hello,
At first i would comment that,you have asked a remarkable question.I hope whatever information i give you,it satisfies you well.
First,let us see what makes us yawn?
Yawning is an involuntary action that causes us to open our mouths wide and breathe in deeply.Anything involuntary is not in our control.
There are many parts of the body that are in action when you yawn. First, your mouth opens and jaw drops, allowing as much air to be taken in as possible. When you inhale, the air taken in is filling your lungs. Your abdominal muscles flex and your diaphragm is pushed down. The air you breath in expands the lungs to capacity and then some of the air is blown back out.
In 2007, researchers proposed that yawning is used to cool the brain. They found that people yawned more often they pressed a warm or room temperature towel against their heads than when they pressed a cold towel against their heads. People who breathed through their noses (thought to reduce brain temperature) did not yawn at all.
It is possible that yawns are contagious because at one time in evolutionary history, the yawn served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. When one member of the group yawned to signal an event, all the other members of the group also yawned. Yawns may still be contagious these days because of a leftover response that is not used anymore.
There are many more theories to yawn but none of them have been proven so far,but the information i provided is general in understanding what exactly a yawn is.
Good Luck.
