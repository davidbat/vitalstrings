an experience in observational psychology
an                        opportunity for a dramatic performance as you deliver an                        essay on communication
an                        opportunity to induce yawning in others
MATERIALS
Copy                        of this essay (with the yawn cues)
PROCEDURE
This observational investigation is designed to be presented                        at home. You will be reading the essay below aloud to your                        friends or family to test their response to yawning. However,                        the essay needs to be performed without your subjects becoming                        aware of its true intent. Therefore, don't tell your family                        or friends what you are really testing. Refrain from discussing                        the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FRONTIERS segment on yawning.
Before you present this essay, you'll need to practice                        it. Like an actor reviewing lines, you'll need to know where                        to seamlessly insert your actions. Remember not to read                        your yawning cues! The more you practice, the easier it                        will become. So practice, practice, practice-but don't let                        anyone hear you! HINT: You might borrow an actor's trick                        and practice delivering this essay in front of a mirror.
When you are ready, explain that your homework assignment                        requires five minutes of assistance from friends or family.                        Gather this group in one room. Explain that you are going                        to read an essay from a science book and you need to test                        their retention of the major concepts.
Begin reading. Observe the reactions of others. Specifically                        be aware of any yawning.
As you read, follow the cues. Keep observing your audience.
When you are done, present the following questions to                        your audience.
Essay                      to be Read and Performed
"People                                  can communicate in many different ways. Most often,                                  our communication is spoken. We reply on our voices                                  to convey our thoughts to others.
Sometimes,                                  however, our communication is non-verbal. Through                                  actions and appearance (yawn here), we communicate                                  to others.
Most                                  people have heard of body language. If you stand                                  up straight, you are likely to communicate a forceful                                  and assertive attitude. If you slouch (yawn here),                                  you may suggest a more patient and resigned approach.                                  But body language goes beyond posture.
Think                                  of animals (yawn here). Have you ever watched                                  a dog "stare-down" another dog? It's a non-verbal                                  challenge. The dominant animal conveys its (yawn                                  here) position without speaking.
But                                  did you realize that yawning is also a type of                                  communication. When we see another human yawn                                  (large yawn here), we get the urge to yawn. Want                                  to see that again? (large yawn again) Although                                  scientists don't understand (yawn here) it fully,                                  they do know that it is a behavior that is contagious.                                  When you see someone yawn, (yawn again), you want                                  to yawn. Yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn and yawn (one                                  final long yawn)."

QUESTIONS
At this moment, who feels like yawning? Are you tired?                        If not, why do you want to yawn?
Is watching someone yawn contagious?
Is hearing about yawning contagious?
Think about yawning. Do these thoughts make you want to                        yawn?
EXTENSIONS
A                      Contagious Dose
How                      much of a yawn is contagious? Do you need to see the entire                      face or are limited facial clues sufficient to induce a desire                      to yawn? Think about it. How would you develop an inquiry                      strategy that would test how much of the face needs to be                      exposed in order to induce yawns in others? Do you think that                      the region above the mouth is necessary for a yawn to be communicated                      as a contagious behavior? How many yawns do you need to observe                      to attain the peak desire to yawn? Develop an experiment that                      would explore any of these aspects of yawning behavior. With                      your instructor's approval, use your strategy to investigate                      yawning.
Cross-Species                      Contageon
Can                      the contagious nature of yawns be transmitted across species?                      If you own a dog, cat or hamster, you may have observed the                      animal's natural yawn behavior. Do you think you can induce                      a yawn in these animals. With your parents' approval, yawn                      in front of these animals. How do they respond? Are they interested                      in your behavior? Do they yawn as well? Record and compare                      your observations with your classmates.
