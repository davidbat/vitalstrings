Answers:
wow - maybe you need to have your exhaust system checked - you could have a carbon monoxide leak into the interior of
your vehicle. you could be yawning from lack of fresh oxygen so I'd try driving with the windows open if possible.
Other Answers:
Boredom probably so used to driving you could probably do it with your eyes closed
In general, yawning alot means oxygen deprivation. it could be you aren't getting enough fresh oxygen in there! Try cracking open a window, and if that doesn't work - take deeper and longer breaths.
DO U LEAVE UR WINDOWS CLOSED OR ROLLED DOWN. IF THIER CLOSED THEN U MAY BE LACKING OXYGEN
mlco has already given the most perfect answer to your query.
