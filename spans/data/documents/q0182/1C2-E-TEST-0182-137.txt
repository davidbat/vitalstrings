Hi Lesley,
 
Thank you for your question. First and foremost, you should check with your doctor about this condition if you're feeling out of the ordinary.
 
To get the conversation started, though, here is some information from an article on our sleep site:
 
Yawning is a normal response to fatigue and drowsiness, but excessive yawning can be caused by a vasovagal reaction. This reaction is caused by the action of a nerve, called the vagus nerve, on the blood vessels. It may indicate a heart problem.
Normal yawning may happen when someone else yawns.
Common Causes
Disorders associated with excessive daytime sleepiness
Vasovagal reaction
