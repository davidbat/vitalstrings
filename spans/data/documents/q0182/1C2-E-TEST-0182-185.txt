Why do I yawn so much?
Today was Day 8 in the gym after I decided to take action in the 'Physical' area of my life. After exercising I start yawing a lot. Why does this happen? Here is what I do in my daily routine.
1. Get up exactly at 5 a.m. everyday.
2. Drink 1 or 2 glass of water till my bowels are emptied.
3. Eat 1 banana before heading off to gym
4. Do treadmill -walking for 20 minutes
5. Do cycling for 10 minutes.
Until this time I feel energized. I sweat a lot after doing treadmill & cycling. Once I start doing workout (stretching & endurance exercises) I feel low. Sometimes I yawn while doing these workouts.
I complete the entire routine in 1 hour. When I reach home I cool-off for 5 mins. During this period I yawn the highest no. of times.
I wanted to know if I am not exercising enough. Should I stop eating pre-exercise? Or is there anything I need to check with my physician.
