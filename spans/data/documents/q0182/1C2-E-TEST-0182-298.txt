The cause of my occassional yawning is lack of sleep, although there were times at the beginning where my T would notice that I was yawning and I didn't think I was tired.
Simple answer.  If you start to unknowingly hyperventillate (not necessarily overtly hyperventillating) your body will work to correct the Oxygen/Carbon Dioxide imbalance...by yawning.  We start to increase our rate of breathing when we're under stress, it may be unnoticeable and after a prolonged episode it throws off the body chemisty and our brain/body work to correct it.
Hope that helps you be more aware of when you're doing it at least, if not be able to start to work to correct it.
That brings to mind a question from me, do you yawn when someone says, "Yawn"?  cause I've been repeatedly yawning throughout this entire post!!!  Ahh, the brain!!!
