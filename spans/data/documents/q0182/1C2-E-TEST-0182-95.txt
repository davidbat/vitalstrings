Block
One of the great health mysteries out there along with the initial cause of hiccups.
Now the obvious explanation is you yawn because you get tired.  Whatever. But recently some doctors have proposed that yawns represent a change in your sense of alertness.  People who are relaxing to a point of sleep will yawn, while also people who are getting excited and nervous will often yawn before an activity like a big athletic event or test. You'll often see swimmers before big races yawn while standing behind the blocks!!
