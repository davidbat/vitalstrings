Physiological Theory: According to this theory, our body induces yawning to draw in more oxygen into the body and remove the build-up of carbon dioxide. This is precisely the reason, why we yawn more often, when we are sitting in a large group, as a large group produces more carbon dioxide. Our bodies try to get rid of carbon dioxide, by drawing in more oxygen.
Cooling of Brain Theory: There are some studies, which point to the fact, that yawning cools the brain, when it is overheated. The brain is able to function at its best, when it is cool and humans and other animals have evolved adaptations to accommodate this.
Evolution Theory: There is a line of thought, according to which, our ancestors started yawning, so that the teeth could be visible and the others can be intimidated. There is an offshoot of this theory as well. According to this new theory, yawning developed from early man as a signal for us to bring about a change in activities, which are currently being carried out. If one has to talk about it evolutionarily, it was a way of maintaining vigilance or alertness.
