Notice how he seems much happier than she is to be caught together by the paparazzi!
After her new movie, Good Luck Chuck was a disappointment at the box office this past weekend, Jessica "Don't Call Me Latina" Alba turned for comfort in the arms of her on/off boyfriend, Cashole Warren.
The couple went shopping Sunday in Malibu.
Jessica treated her man to a new pair of sneakers.
Now we ain't saying he's a golddigger….
Okay, we are!
