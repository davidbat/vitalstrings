As long as it isn't EVERY date, I think you don't have anything to worry about.  As stated above he is probably just tired.  What does he do for work? Something mentally/physically draining? Both will obviously make him tired and exhausted.
Maybe one time you guys are going to 'go out' on a date, you could instead stay in and have a bed date! (if you are both comfortable with that)
My GF and I do that sometimes if we both just can't be bothered going out.  We will just go to our room, put on some of our favorite music and lay there and snuggle up to each other and chat...I guess the stereotype is that most guys would hate that, but its worth a shot.  I thought I would get bored doing something like that, but if he likes you enough he will love every minute of it
