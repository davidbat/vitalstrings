Yawning horse: Permission given for image use by my dear friend, Frank.
We have all seen our horses yawn.  Why does a horse yawn?  That is a good question.  In fact, it is not really known why horse yawn.  Some suggestions for this behavior are the following:
Change of sleeping, napping and waking state.
Physical fatigue
Mental stress
Release of mental or physical stress.  Horses will often yawn after a chiropractor session or massage session.  They will also pass gas!
An attempt to clear airways or equalize pressure in the ears.
Extending jaw muscles
Pain ( colic , ulcers , trimengial* nerve pain in the face, teeth, gums, etc.)
*The trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensation in the face. Sensory information from the face and body is processed by parallel pathways in the central nervous system.
The trigeminal nerve distribution in the horse's head. The three branches of the trigeminal are shown (ophthalmic (1 st), maxillary (2 nd) and mandibular (3 rd)).

Neurological problem
Liver disease
Parasites - My husband's horse has neck threadworms that have travelled to the eyes. This horse sometimes yawns more often when the parasites are active in the spring.  We have no Equine Parasites scientific proof, but this has been our observation.
