3 Physiological Hypotheses
 
3.1 Respiratory and Circulatory                      Hypotheses For several centuries, at least                      since Hippocrates in the 4th century BC,                      scholars have thought that yawning might remove                      "bad air" from the lungs and increase oxygen                      circulation in the brain (Trautmann, 1901;                      Schiller, 2002; Matikainen and Elo, 2008).
 
3.1.1 Oxygen Need and Hypercapnia Do Not                      Induce Yawning This hypothesis predicts that                      yawning is triggered when blood or brain                      oxygenation is insufficient, i.e., when oxygen                      (O2) levels drop and the CO2 concentration                      rises. However, from self-observation most                      people will confirm that they do not yawn more                      frequently when they do exercise and need more                      oxygen than when they are at rest (Provine et al., 1987b). In accordance with this notion,                      experiments by Provine et al. (Provine et al.,                      1987b) demonstrated that healthy subjects who                      are exposed to gas mixtures with high levels of                      CO2 or physical exercise, do not yawn more                      frequently. .........
 
Taken together, the occurrence of yawning                      during periods with too much blood oxygenation                      but not during periods with oxygen need is                      exactly the opposite of what would have been                      predicted by the respiration hypothesis and thus                      casts severe doubts on its correctness.
 
3.1.2 Yawning Does Probably Not Increase                      Brain Oxygenation There are, to our                      knowledge, no studies that measured the change                      in blood oxygenation induced by yawning.                      However, yawning would be a much less effective                      way of increasing oxygen intake than rapid                      breathing, especially since the deep inspiration                      during yawning is followed by a period of                      relative apnoea (Baenninger, 1997).                      ........
 
3.1.3 Conclusions The predictions of the                      respiratory hypothesis are not supported by                      current experimental data. Additional research                      is needed to test the effects of hypoxia on the                      yawning rate under more controlled conditions.                      Studies investigating the effects of yawning on blood and brain ygenation are also missing.                      Given current evidence, it seems unlikely that                      yawning has respiratory or circulatory                      functions.
 
3.2 The Arousal Hypothesis The idea                      that yawning might play an important role in                      regulating physiological brain processes has                      remained in the literature also after the                      appearance of evidence against the respiratory                      hypotheses. A widely expressed proposition now                      speculated that yawning might be responsible for                      the homeostatic regulation of vigilance and                      brain arousal level (Baenninger, 1997; Giganti                      et al., 2002; Walusinski and Deputte, 2004;                      Matikainen and Elo, 2008; Vick and Paukner,                      2010).
 
3.2.1 Drowsiness Induces Yawning Yawning occurs preferentially during periods of                      drowsiness, as it is predicted by the arousal                      hypothesis. Behavioural studies consistently                      reported that yawns occur most frequently before                      and after sleep, i.e., during periods with lower                      levels of alertness (Greco et al., 1993; Provine                      et al., 1987a). The circadian distribution of                      yawns precisely reflects the individual                      sleep-wake rhythm (Giganti et al., 2007; Zilli                      et al., 2007; Zilli et al., 2008).
....
Thus, sleep pressure and drowsiness proved significantly greater when subjects yawned than                      when they moved only.
 
3.2.2 Yawning Does Not Produce an                      Arousal Arousals are defined as a global                      activation of brain activity that progresses                      from brain stem structures to centres of the                      autonomic nervous system and to distributed                      cortical areas (Moruzzi and Magoun, 1949; Sforza                      et al., 2000). They are accompanied by a typical                      acceleration of EEG activity. Several studies                      have therefore analyzed spectral EEG changes                      after yawns in humans to test the hypothesis                      that yawning has an arousing effect. However,                      the results were negative. Two studies looking                      at 30 s samples of EEG before and after yawns                      were unable to find significant and lasting                      changes in EEG activity related to yawns (Laing                      and Ogilvie, 1988; Regehr et al., 1992). One of                      these studies reported transient increases in                      theta, spindle, and beta activity, but they only                      reached significance when the analysis was a                      priori limited to data segments between 10 and                      20 s before and after yawning (Regehr et al.,                      1992). Furthermore, EEG power after yawning was                      not significantly different from EEG power after                      postural adjustments without yawning (Laing and                      Ogilvie, 1988). In our analyses of EEG power                      spectra from patients undergoing MWTs, we                      observed that the increase in delta power over                      the vertex that was found before yawning (as                      compared to delta activity before postural                      adjustments without yawning, see 3.2.1 above)                      persisted to the same amount also after yawning                      (Fig. 1, right panel). Thus, yawning did not                      reverse the increased sleep pressure and                      drowsiness that seemed to have triggered it.                      Besides delta power, alpha oscillations (~ 7.5 -                      12.5 Hz) also reflect the individual vigilance                      level. They become faster and smaller in                      amplitude when the arousal level increases.                      Figure 2A gives an example of the EEG power                      spectrum 30 min after oral ingestion of 250 mg                      caffeine (Barry et al., 2005). In contrast,                      drowsiness is associated with a slowing of alpha                      oscillations, and with a shift of alpha                      oscillations from mainly occipital towards                      central brain regions (Tanaka et al., 1997; De                      Gennaro et al., 2001b; De Gennaro et al.,                      2001a). Figure 2B shows that alpha power after                      yawning showed a pattern that is typical for                      sleepiness: alpha rhythms decelerated, and                      shifted towards central brain regions after                      yawning, as compared to the data segments before                      yawning. Conversely, we did observe EEG markers                      of increased arousal levels after simple                      postural adjustments, as shown in Figure 2C:                      alpha rhythms became faster and smaller after                      body movements. Hence, if yawning had an                      arousing effect &endash; even if it were as                      small as the effect of simple postural                      adjustments &endash; we would have detected it with our EEG analyses. Instead, we observed                      signs of progressive drowsiness after                      yawning.

3.2.3 Conclusions The experimental data                      suggests that yawning indeed occurs during                      progressive drowsiness, which is compatible with                      the notion that it is triggered by states of low                      vigilance. However, no specific arousing effect                      of yawning on the brain or the autonomic nervous                      system could be observed. Experimental evidence                      therefore suggests a rejection of the arousal                      hypothesis. The absence of an arousing effect of                      yawning does obviously not exclude that it might                      have some other form of activating function on                      brain metabolism or neuropharmacology, but these                      effects should not be named arousal.
 
3.3 The Sleepiness Hypothesis Rather                      than attributing an arousing effect to yawning,                      some authors have suggested that it might lower                      the arousal level (Deputte, 1994). Studies                      assessing the arousal level after yawing have                      indeed found signs of decreasing wakefulness                      (see section 3.2.2 above), which would be                      compatible with this notion. However, the                      observations could simply represent the                      drowsiness underlying yawning that continues to                      progress also after yawning. Thus, there is no                      established causal link between yawning and                      subsequent drowsiness. Moreover, if yawning had                      a soporific effect apart from being induced by                      drowsiness, it would be a self-reinforcing                      mechanism and would need to be controlled by                      other processes in order to ensure stability of                      the sleep-wake balance.
 
3.4 The Thermoregulation Hypothesis Recently, another physiological function of                      yawning has been proposed: the regulation of                      brain temperature. It is postulated that yawning                      might cool down the brain when its temperature                      increases. The advocates of this model give a                      detailed description of their arguments in                      (Gallup and Gallup, Jr., 2008). Here, we provide                      a brief critique of the corresponding                      experimental evidence.
 
3.4.1 Does Brain Hyperthermia Trigger                      Yawning? .......
 
The same concern also applies to a second                      study of the same group performed in birds which                      were exposed to different ambient temperature                      conditions. A rapidly increasing room                      temperature was associated with more frequent                      yawns than relatively stable cold or warm                      temperatures (Gallup et al., 2009), which may                      again be due to uncontrolled factors such as                      differences in drowsiness or related to rapidly                      changing vs. stable temperatures. The proponents                      of the thermoregulation hypothesis also advance                      anecdotal data of yawning frequency in patients                      with different brain diseases, but in the                      absence of direct comparisons and controls, the                      evidence remains inconclusive.
 
3.4.2 Yawning Does Probably Not Cool Down                      the Brain The greatest challenge for the                      proponents of the thermoregulation hypothesis                      lies in demonstrating how yawning would be able                      to cool down the brain. It is suggested that the                      inflow of cool air during yawning ventilates                      heat off the brain. However, the proposition                      faces similar problems as the respiratory                      hypotheses discussed above. Yawning actually                      interrupts normal nasal breathing which seems to                      be a more efficient way of ventilation.
 
3.4.3 Conclusions There is currently                      insufficient evidence for a thermoregulatory                      effect of yawning. The thermoregulation                      hypothesis seems to be counterintuitive and has                      important explanatory gaps which seem to be                      difficult to close.
 
3.5 The Ear Pressure Hypothesis Yawning has the much appreciated capacity to                      equalize air pressure in the middle ear with                      outside air pressure. It can thus relieve                      discomfort in the ear and hearing problems due                      to rapid altitude changes in air planes or                      elevators. This is achieved through contraction                      and relaxation of tensor tympani and stapedius                      muscles during yawning, which results in an                      opening of the Eustachian tubes and the aeration                      of the tympanal cavities (Laskiewicz, 1953;                      Winther et al., 2005). This observation has led                      to the postulation that yawning might be a                      "defence reflex" of the ear, which is triggered                      by rapid altitude changes or other conditions                      leading to air trapping in the middle ear                      (Laskiewicz, 1953). However, there is to our                      knowledge no systematic investigation that would                      confirm increased yawning rates under rapidly                      changing ear pressure conditions. Also, yawning                      is not the only mechanism to open the Eustachian                      tube; swallowing, chewing, and the Valsalva                      manoeuvre have the same effect (Laskiewicz,                      1953; Winther et al., 2005). The middle ear                      pressure release of yawning does therefore not                      represent by itself an indispensable                      evolutionary advantage. Equalization of ear                      pressure seems to be a useful effect that yawns                      have in common with other contractions of                      oropharyngeal muscles rather than the primary                      purpose of yawning.
 
3.6 The State Change Hypothesis Rather than suggesting a single physiological                      function of yawning, Provine attempted to                      combine the multiple behavioural state changes                      associated with yawning (wakefulness to sleep,                      sleep to wakefulness, alertness to boredom, etc)                      within a single framework. He proposed that                      "yawning is a vigorous, widespread act that may                      stir up our physiology and facilitate these                      transitions" (Provine, 1986; Provine, 2005).                      This approach has the advantage that it might                      integrate findings from different research                      fields. However, the proposition does not go                      beyond a mere description of the behavioural                      changes associated with yawning and does not                      give insights into how or why the proposed state                      changes might be achieved. Given the current                      scarcity of experimental evidence for any                      physiological function of yawning, the                      combination of several physiological states                      within a single concept also lacks empirical                      support.
 
3.7 Other Physiological Hypotheses Several other variants of a regulatory function                      of yawning on body physiology have been proposed                      (Smith, 1999). To name only a few: yawning                      prevents lung atelectasis (Cahill, 1978);                      yawning renews surfactant films in lungs                      (Forrester, 1988); yawning ensures intermittent                      evacuation of the palatine tonsillar fossae                      (McKenzie, 1994). None of these propositions has                      been experimentally tested. 4 The                      Social/Communication Hypothesis In many                      cultures, yawning is interpreted as a sign of                      boredom and sleepiness and is therefore                      considered to be rude (Schiller, 2002). Thus,                      yawning seems to communicate a message that is                      almost universally understood. Moreover, yawning                      frequently occurs in social contexts. A                      communicative function of yawning has therefore                      long been suspected. The hypothesis states that                      yawning is a non-verbal form of communication                      that synchronizes the behaviour of a group                      (Barbizet, 1958; Provine, 1986; Weller, 1988;                      Deputte, 1994).
 
4.1 Yawning Has Physiological and Social                      Triggers Yawning can be triggered by several                      different physiological body states as well as                      social contexts. Drowsiness (see above) and                      boredom (Provine and Hamernik, 1986) are well                      documented precursors of yawning. Observations                      in animals further suggest that yawns may be                      facilitated by hunger or mild psychological                      stress (Deputte, 1994). The communication                      hypothesis accounts for all these inductors by                      stating that they generate yawning to transmit                      the corresponding information to other members                      of a social group. The number of possible                      yawning triggers must of course not be                      unlimited; otherwise the transmitted message                      would be too ambiguous. Indeed, all triggers of                      yawning mentioned above have in common that they                      are mildly to moderately unpleasant while not                      presenting an immediate threat.
 
4.2 Social Effects of Yawning The                      social hypothesis predicts that yawning has some                      impact on the behavioural organization of a                      social group. Communication should result in                      better synchronization of group behaviour. Such                      effects have indeed been observed in Ostriches                      (Sauer and Sauer, 1967), but studies that test                      the prediction in a controlled fashion are                      lacking.
 
4.3 Contagious Yawning Yawning has a                      well-known contagious effect in humans                      (Baenninger, 1987; Provine et al., 1987b;                      Provine, 1989a; Provine, 1989b; Platek et al.,                      2003) and this effect is now frequently used to                      induce yawning for research purposes. Recent                      studies have accumulated evidence that this                      contagiousness depends on an intact social                      competence of the yawning individual. The                      susceptibility to contagious yawning correlates                      with empathic skills in healthy humans (Platek                      et al., 2003) and is reduced in patients with                      disorders affecting the ability of social                      interaction, such as autism (Senju et al., 2007)                      and schizophrenia (Lehmann, 1979; Haker and                      Rossler, 2009). In patients with schizophrenia,                      the occurrence of yawns has been interpreted as                      a positive sign indicating that the patient is                      in an accessible mood (Lehmann, 1979).
 
Watching or hearing other persons yawn                      activates a complex network of brain regions                      related to motor imitation, empathy, and social                      behaviour. Figure 3 illustrates the brain                      regions that have been reported to activate in                      different functional magnetic resonance imaging                      (fMRI) studies when human subjects observe yawns                      of others. The so-called mirror neuron system is                      important for action understanding and imitation                      (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004) and mirror                      neurons in the right posterior inferior frontal                      gyrus also seem to be recruited for contagious                      yawning (Arnott et al., 2009). The mirror neuron                      activity is however not specific to yawning but                      occurs to the same amount also during                      observation of other movements (Nahab et al.,                      2009; Arnott et al., 2009). Activations that are                      more specific to contagious yawns have been                      observed in the posterior cingulate (Platek et                      al., 2005), the bilateral superior temporal                      sulcus (Schurmann et al., 2005), or the                      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Nahab et al.,                      2009). The fMRI activations in these areas were                      significantly greater when the study subjects                      watched other persons yawn than when they                      watched control face movements of others.                      Although different studies have reported                      divergent areas to be implicated in contagious                      yawning, all of them seem to be part of a                      distributed neural network related to empathy                      and social behaviour (Saxe et al., 2004;                      Carrington and Bailey, 2009). In children, no                      contagious yawning can be induced before the age                      of five (Anderson and Meno, 2003), suggesting                      that the contagiousness of yawning depends on                      mechanisms that have to develop during childhood                      in parallel with the empathic capacity to                      understand mental states of others (Saxe et al.,                      2004).
 
In animals, contagious yawning has been                      consistently observed in chimpanzees (Anderson                      et al., 2004; Campbell et al., 2009; Vick and                      Paukner, 2010), whereas it seems to be absent in                      lions (Baenninger, 1987). In old-world monkeys                      (Baenninger, 1987; Paukner and Anderson, 2006;                      Palagi et al., 2009) and dogs (Joly-Mascheroni                      et al., 2008; Harr et al., 2009), different                      studies showed divergent results, but contagious                      yawning occurs at least in some individuals. The                      findings from animal studies therefore also                      support the notion that contagious yawning                      mostly occurs in individuals and species with                      advanced empathic and social skills. In monkeys,                      the contagiousness of yawning correlates with                      the level of grooming contact between                      individuals (Palagi et al., 2009), i.e., it is                      higher in animals that are socially and                      emotionally close to each other. In summary,                      research on contagious yawning has revealed that                      yawns are part of the action repertoire of                      empathic and communicative processes in adult humans and some mammals, which provides strong                      evidence for a social role of yawns in these                      species.
 
4.4 Other Social Modulators of                      Yawning Social contexts were found to have                      an important impact on the yawning rate. In                      animals, the hierarchical position within a                      social group influences the frequency of                      yawning: group leaders initiate more yawns than                      subordinates (Hadidian, 1980). This difference                      in the yawning rate may correspond to the                      greater importance of communications from                      leaders than from other individuals for the                      synchronized behaviour of the group (Sauer and                      Sauer, 1967), and may thus also be explained                      within the framework of the communication                      hypothesis. There are however also yawns that                      are independent of social modulation. Yawning                      also occurs when individuals are alone and in                      non-social animals. This might be used as an                      argument against the communication hypothesis                      and for the need to postulate an additional                      physiological effect of yawning. However, the                      existence of yawns during aloneness does not                      contradict the communication hypothesis in                      general; it merely shows that the generators of                      yawning lack a negative feedback mechanism                      checking for the presence of other individuals.                      Hence, the message of yawning seems to be                      triggered by certain body states and "sent out",                      no matter whether there are other individuals                      that might actually receive it. In humans, the                      presence of other humans may even have a                      suppressive effect on the yawning rate. If human                      subjects feel socially observed, they completely                      stop yawning even if the usual conditions of                      yawning are met (Baenninger and Greco, 1991;                      Provine, 2005). This suppression may result from                      arousing effects inherent to social observation.                      Alternatively, the negative connotation of                      yawning in human society may push the                      individuals to hide or inhibit yawns when they                      are felt to be inappropriate.
 
4.5 Conclusions The communication hypothesis                      has the best experimental evidence among all                      propositions on the function of yawning. It is                      the only model that can account for social                      effects of yawning such as contagiousness and                      for the different physiological states and                      social contexts that can trigger it.
 
Missing elements of this model include                      controlled studies observing a regulating effect                      of yawning on synchronized group behaviour and                      data on the neuropharmacological mechanisms                      underlying the social inductors and effects of                      yawning. It is also far from clear whether the                      findings of contagious yawns derived mostly from                      studies in humans and primates can be                      generalized to other forms of yawns and to yawns in other species. The social aspects of                      spontaneous (non-contagious) yawns, particularly                      in species and individuals who are not                      susceptible to contagious yawning, have received                      little research interest so far.
 
5 Discussion
In 1986, Robert R. Provine, the pioneer in                      yawning research, wrote that "yawning may have                      the dubious distinction of being the least                      understood, common human behaviour." (Provine,                      1986). Today, more than two decades later, this                      may well still be the case. In particular, the                      centuries-old question of why we yawn still                      awaits a corroborated answer. None of the                      numerous propositions on the function of yawning                      has currently sufficient experimental support or                      links to neuropharmacological mechanisms.                      Nevertheless, the preceding sections (which are                      summarized in Table 1) may have demonstrated                      that the emphasis of models on yawning has                      changed. Whereas traditional hypotheses were                      mostly characterized by the quest for a                      physiological function of yawning in                      individuals, these propositions now face severe                      explanatory problems or lack empirical evidence.                      In contrast, the idea that yawning might rather                      serve a social function in groups of individuals                      receives increasing support from studies in                      different fields. It emerges that yawning might communicate unpleasant but not immediately                      threatening states to other members of a group                      in order to enhance behavioural                      synchronization.
 
This social hypothesis of yawning is also                      the only model that can account by itself for                      all elements associated with yawns. For                      instance, contagious effects or social contexts                      of yawning cannot be explained when assuming a                      purely physiological function. Physiological                      hypotheses therefore have to postulate social                      effects in addition to a physiological effect of                      yawning, whereas the physiological triggers of                      yawning form an integral part of social models.                      Hence, the social hypothesis has not only the                      best experimental support but is also the most                      parsimonious model.
 
From an evolutionary perspective, the                      communicative value of yawning may yield                      sufficient advantage to explain its persistence                      and frequent usage in many vertebrate species.                      The capacity to exchange information about the                      physical and mental state of each individual                      seems indeed to be crucial for the survival of a                      group. There is therefore no need to postulate                      additional physiological functions of yawning to                      explain its selection during evolution. One may                      argue that the difficulties with physiological                      models results from an oversimplification of a complex phenomenon.
 
There might be different types of yawning                      that assume different functions which are                      unrecognized if all yawns are inappropriately                      pooled. However, the data from observational                      studies does not support this notion. Although                      numerous yawn morphologies and contexts have                      been described (Provine, 1986; Deputte, 1994;                      Baenninger, 1987; Palagi et al., 2009; Vick and                      Paukner, 2010), the different studies did not                      converge on a consistent classification into                      well-delimited types. Furthermore, most studies                      found no functional or contextual differences                      among the different yawning morphologies                      (Provine, 1986; Deputte, 1994; Baenninger, 1987;                      Palagi et al., 2009). Vick and Paukner (2010)                      interpreted differences in the scratching rate                      after "full yawns" vs. "modified yawns" with                      additional voluntary face movements of                      chimpanzees as evidence for a selective arousal                      effect of modified yawns only, but we have seen                      above that indirect behavioural markers of                      arousals are problematic. The current limited                      data therefore seems to suggest that yawning is                      a single mechanism associated with a continuum                      of behavioural manifestations rather than a                      discrete set of functional entities.
 
On the species level, the generators and                      functions of yawning may have evolved                      differently in different species, and yawns may                      even be a residual of earlier life forms with no                      remaining function at all in some species.                      However, in the absence of evidence for                      systematic differences in the mechanisms and                      functions of yawning between species or yawn                      morphologies, this call for more complexity does                      not withstand the simplicity and elegance of the                      social model of yawning. In conclusion, current                      data suggests that we might have to get used to                      the idea that yawns have a primarily social                      rather than physiological function.
 
6 Future Research Directions Several                      lessons can be learned from research of the last                      3 decades. Experience with the respiratory and                      arousal hypotheses demonstrates that one must be                      careful when interpreting indirect or anecdotal                      evidence. Although both hypotheses had some                      arguments and indirect evidence on their side,                      direct measurements showed negative results. In                      order to differentiate between specific features                      of yawning and nonspecific coexisting elements,                      it is important to include control groups or                      conditions during experiments. The lack of                      controlled experimental studies on yawning                      illustrates the need for research programs in                      all related fields. Some of the specific                      questions that could be addressed are listed in                      Table 2.
 
All current models on the function of                      yawning are derived from observations of the                      phenomenology and contexts of yawning, which may                      result in a negligence of aspects that are not                      behaviourally evident. An exploration of the                      neural and metabolic mechanisms may give new                      hints on the functions of yawning that were                      hitherto unsuspected or on the mechanisms of                      existing concepts. Future research should                      therefore systematically assess behavioural,                      physiological, and social features of yawning                      and combine observational with interventional                      techniques. This requires interdisciplinary                      strategies that would overcome limitations of                      traditional techniques. For example, a                      combination of interventional approaches [e.g., administration of yawn-inducing or                      -inhibiting drugs (Argiolas and Melis, 1998),                      experimental lesions of brain structures                      involved in yawn-generation such as the PVN                      (Argiolas et al., 1987), manipulation of                      environmental conditions] with systematic                      behavioural observations during wakefulness may                      increase the value of both animal models and                      observational approaches.
 
A multimodal approach of this kind also                      seems to be necessary to resolve long-standing                      controversies on whether different types of                      yawning exist and on whether yawns in different                      species are homologous. Future studies                      addressing these issues should systematically                      compare not only behavioural but also social,                      functional, and physiological parameters when                      trying to classify yawns within and across                      species. Besides this explorative approach,                      there is also a need for hypothesis-driven                      research based on the current models of yawning.                      Numerous open questions related to the                      hypotheses discussed above remain unanswered;                      Table 2 lists only a few. Page 26 of 37
