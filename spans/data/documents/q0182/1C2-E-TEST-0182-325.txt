Haha, I asked my teacher the same question. There's not an actual clear cut reason as to why cats yawn. Some believe it could be from boredom or being tired like us humans. Others believe it could be a sign of relaxation, anxiety, or feeling scared. It could also be a way of communication to others of it's feelings. There's also been a study that when a cat yawns it is relaxing it's muscles from extra unwanted energy to relax better and more comfortably. In fact, I've seen my cat show a display of that once. Once she yawned, she'll lie flat belly on the ground and fall half asleep. Hope I helped!
