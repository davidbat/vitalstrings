At time this can be a tricky affair. But with practice and a few tricks you can make it a pleasant and rewarding experience.
Yawning to empathize
The dog is truly man's best friend. These furry creatures are sensitive to the feelings of the master. Most dogs would be wise to the emotional upheaval the master is facing and it would not be surprising to see these dogs offer comfort even with snuggling or rubbing their bodies against the master. People yawn when tired. A dog seeing a tired master yawn would yawn too.
Yawning as a result of domestication
Dogs are known to emulate their master's actions. Watch how your pet would stand up when you do; flop down the couch when you do. Yawning is contagious and it is believed that this act was adapted by the dog through the interaction with humans. Since dogs and humans have been living together for thousand and thousand of year it will not be surprising to see the animal adapt human ways.
Yawning to recharge and energize
Dogs that are about to compete in agility competitions are seen yawning. This is the dog's way of coping with the stressful situation. By yawning, the dogs take deep breaths that fill the lungs with oxygen. This increases the flow of oxygen to the brain. Blood pressure and heart rate increases too. This prepares the dog's body for the action.
The calming effect of the yawn
There is actually no definitive reason why a dog yawns. A yawn recharges and energizes the dog but it also has a calming effect. Stressed dogs in a vet's waiting room would yawn to calm themselves. This is similar to the yawning of a person who is about to be interviewed for a job.
Other reasons why dogs yawn
The most obvious reason why dogs yawn is that they are sleepy or tired. The yawning is a sign that the dog is about to sleep. Yawning can also be a sign of boredom. A dog left alone for a considerable time will yawn and would seem to say, "Gosh, where are my playmates?"
