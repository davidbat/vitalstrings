I learned this in psychology class, when we see or hear someone else yawn, we tend to yawn immediately after.
We yawn because of sleepiness

The scientific factual answer is: lack of oxygen.
When the body gets tired and ready for sleep everything starts slowing and calming down (less brain activity, heavy eye lids, slower heart and blood flow) but if we're still up and about and doing activities our bodies needs extra oxygen and blood flow to do it. So because our bodies tired and ready for sleep (slowly shutting down) our response is to yawn to get more oxygen in the body then we can continue the activity until we're ready for sleep (finishing homework even though your really tired, you'll keep on trying to finish coz its gotta be in tomorrow but its 1am and your body wants to sleep, hence YAWN - body needs more oxygen to complete task because its ready for bed)
Simple when you know :)
