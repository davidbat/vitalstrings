I yawned just reading the question "Why do we yawn?".

Dammit. I attempted to read some of the links and yawned no less than five times. I need to get out of this thread- my eyes are starting to water.

I just yawned reading Dr-Baa's comment about the question "Why do we yawn".
And again typing that.

Do you reckon that it might be a form a coercion/control, in that we show our teeth and that's threatening. I'm tired - I display threatening behaviour (show my teeth with a wide open mouth), you'd better follow suit (you comply rather than challenge).

But it's the many theories phenomenon that heats up the brain in the first place.

Newborns have problems with heat-retention and in particular their heads have a high (compared to older children and adults) surface-area to volume ratio, making the problem even worse for their brains.  Newborns yawn.  I doubt it's to cool their brains.

I know nothing about...whatever kind of behavioral science would study this kind of thing, but I tend to doubt it. Why would everyone comply?  If it's instinctual, than wouldn't some people challenge?

I don't buy this. How much cooling is achieved with one yawn? How long would such cooling effects last? Why would yawning be associated with tiredness and boredom and not, say, hiking in the desert?

No, no, no. It is to embiggen the jawbitering bands. Yeah, that's the ticket.

If yawning cools our brains, then why are yawns contagious?  Are our brains jealous of other "cooler" lobes?  Is there some sort of cliquish nature to brains?  It's hard to tell...my brain just told me 'yes.'  Now it's telling me to go get some cookies.  Be right back...

The question isn't "Why do we yawn" but "why do animals yawn" Since we evolved from animals, Yawning may have served some purpose in pre-human animals that may be vestigial today.
I think it's just a way for animals to signal their sleepiness to each other in order to get groups to go to sleep at the same time.

Another good sleep signal: Lying down, closing your eyes and going "honk-shuuuuuu".

What is most interesting about this question is how many people think they know the answer.  In fifth grade science, I was taught that people yawn because they need more oxygen at that particular moment.  It was fact.  It wasn't until much later, when I was an adult, that I learned that nobody really knows.  I guess that was true of many things.
Science is much more interesting when you realize how many unanswered questions there are.

Or to look completely adorable
it is more difficult to find cute animals through GIS than I had anticipated

a cooler brain is more alert
Is this true? Are people more alert when living in cold climates than in hot climates? Is there an optimum operating temperature, or does it just depend on what you're used to?

I yawn to show the world how much oxygen I can take in all it once, hoping they will be impressed. But they all immediately respond by demonstrating that they are also capable of taking in large amount of oxygen in one large gulp, thereby shaming me.

No, we vote Republican because we are against the socialist agenda of the Democratic Party.
Thought you guys would have picked up on that by now.

Because we're fucking tired?  I win.

Just we need.  A behavioural recipe for more cool brains.  I can already picture the avalanche of 'meh' comments this will result in.

What do we know about the function of a yawn?  It equalizes the air pressure in the ear canals by opening up the eustachian tubes.  I think you could develop yet another theory from that starting point.

i like the idea that we show our teeth automatically when tired to warn competitors away from mates / food, so that they won't think we are incapacitated by tiredness and strike.
and of course the learned social behavior of covering up our mouths when yawning would be to hide that aggression as it's not polite (or veil it slightly, as the article notes).
great post.

If yawning serves the purpose of getting everyone to sleep at the same time, why would solitary animals yawn, e.g. wild cats.

Damnit I yawned something like eight times reading this... nine times reading this thread.
Damnit, TEN. I'm leaving.
Why do we yawn just thinking about yawns (eleven) or when we see the word?

It also feels good, like stretching or sneezing.
