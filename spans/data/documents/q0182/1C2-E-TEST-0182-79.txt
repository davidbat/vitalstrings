Why do w yawn when....(Have you started to yawn yet?)
Why do we yawn? Why did I just yawn while reading your question? Power of suggestion possibly? Or better yet, a subliminal message.
 
While browsing Google, I found this interesting website which somewhat explains yawning:

On the bottom of the article, there is an experiment one can take on biological rhythms if they can stop yawning long enough to take it.
 
In the preschool class I work in, there is a song that involves yawning and I might be feeling extremely energetic but as soon as we have to sing, "Yawn, yawn, yawn my sleepies out..." there I go yawning with my mouth wide open like I haven't slept in days!
 
I heard once that we yawn from lack of oxygen to our brains and that our brains instruct our body to yawn to bring more oxygen in. Hmmnnn...very interesting.  I suppose when we're bored, we feel like falling asleep from lack of stimulation so naturally, we yawn.
 
Whatever the reason, if bringing oxygen into the brain helps us think clearly and yawning is something good for our bodies, then by all means, yawn away! <yawnnnnnn...>
