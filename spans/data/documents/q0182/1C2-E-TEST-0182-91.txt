Why do we yawn?
Yawning is a normal response to fatigue and drowsiness, but excessive yawning can be caused by a vasovagal reaction. This reaction is caused by the action of a nerve, called the vagus nerve, on the blood vessels. It may indicate a heart problem. One can yawn due to drowsiness or weariness, disorders associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and vasovagal reaction
