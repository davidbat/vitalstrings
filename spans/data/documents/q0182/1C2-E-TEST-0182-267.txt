@alina- So I spent like three hours in the emergency room last night. After chest x-rays and blood work, the doctor said that the best explanation he could come up with was that I was having some acid reflux action and that’s what was causing the spasm-y chest pain. He also said that acid reflux can cause you to feel like your chest is tight and your breathing restricted. Apparently, my lungs sounded clear and my blood oxygen level was normal, so he thought that’s what it was. He actually characterized it as his “best guess”, saying that he really couldn’t be totally sure what was going on. I got a prescription for some acid reflux medicine that I’m supposed to take for a week, and see if there’s any improvement. Feels inconclusive…
