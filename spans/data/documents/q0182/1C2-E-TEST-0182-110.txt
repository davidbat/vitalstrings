 
ABSTRACT
Yawning can be regarded as a prototype of                      stereotypical behaviors recycled through the                      evolution for different purposes along with                      increasing complexity of the central nervous                      system, correlated with the richness of social                      interactions. In this chapter, past and current                      hypotheses concerning the generation and                      usefulness of yawning are discussed.
 
INTRODUCTION
Cognition, emotion, behavior and memory are                      all brain functions. However, this was not                      accepted to be true until the end of the 18th                      century. While eating, drinking, urination,                      sight and walking seem easy to understand, the                      purpose of other functions that originate in the                      brain, such as sleep, dreaming, hiccups and                      laughter remains mysterious. Yawning belongs to                      this second group of functions, which appear                      more difficult to understand than the other                      functions of the brain. This might explain the                      vast array of beliefs and hypotheses, as varied                      as they are strange in certain cases, associated                      with what for human being is a daily behavior.                      As we shall see, several diverse hypotheses                      exist in 2011, but for the moment none can be                      scientifically verified.
 
What is a yawn?
Yawning is a stereotyped and often                      repetitive motor act characterised by gaping of                      the mouth accompanied by a long inspiration of                      breath, a brief acme, and then a short                      expiration of breath. Stretching and yawning                      simultaneously is known as pandiculation, which                      is not merely a simple opening of the mouth but                      a complex, coordinated movement bringing                      together a flexion followed by an extension of                      the neck and a wide dilatation of the                      pharyngolarynx with strong stretching of the                      diaphragm and anti-gravity muscles. Yawning is                      involuntary and only humans seem capable of                      altering its occurrence for cultural or social                      reasons. It is highly stereotypical because no                      environmental input changes the sequence of                      movements. Yawning is observed in cold-blooded                      and warm-blooded vertebrates, from reptiles with                      rudimentary "archaic" brains to human primates,                      in water, air and land environments. Ethologists                      agree that almost all vertebrates yawn. Yawning is morphologically similar in reptiles, birds,                      mammals and fish (Deputte, 1994; Fraser, 1989;                      Walusinski, 2004). These behaviors may be                      ancestral vestiges maintained throughout                      evolution with little variation                      (phylogenetically old origins). Correlatively,                      yawning can be viewed as early as 12 weeks                      during fetal development (ontogenetically                      primitive) (Walusinski, 2010).
 
Different types of yawns
The triune brain hypothesis is a model of                      the evolution of vertebrate forebrain and                      behavior proposed by the American                      neuroscientist, Paul D. MacLean (1913-2007).                      MacLean originally formulated his model in the                      1960s and propounded it at length in his 1990                      book, The Triune Brain in Evolution. The triune                      brain consists of the reptilian complex (archaic                      brain), the paleomammalian complex (limbic                      system), and the neomammalian complex                      (neocortex), viewed as structures sequentially                      added to the forebrain in the course of                      evolution (Mc Lean, 1990). Although the model                      never won wide acceptance among comparative                      neurobiologists, it helps to explain the                      different types of yawns:
 
1) universal yawning, is seen in nearly all                      vertebrates, is associated with sleep and                      arousal or with hunger and satiety, and appears to be generated by the reptilian brain (Giganti,                      2010).
 
2) what ethologists describe as emotional                      yawning, is only seen in some mammals (but data                      still being collected), and is generated by the                      paleomammalian brain. This is the yawn, which                      helps to pacify after stress. Dogs in veterinary                      situations or caged chimpanzees yawn more                      frequently than during non-stressful times.                      Ethologists call this type of behavior a                      displacement activity. In humans, athletes yawn                      repeatedly before competitions, as do                      parachutists before jumping and actors before                      making their entrance. In these cases, yawning                      has a calming, anti-stress effect. This might                      explain why yoga teachers use yawning to relax                      their students. A related type of yawning is                      that associated with sexuality in dominant male                      macaques, who yawn repeatedly before mating, as                      if to make their status within the group known.                      This sort of yawn disappears following                      castration and reappears if testosterone is                      injected (Aureli, 1997; Beckmann, 1981; Deputte,                      1994; Maestripieri, 1992; Zucker, 1998) .
 
3) "contagious yawning", is observed only in                      great apes and humans who display a theory of                      mind. This ability to respond to yawning in                      others is absent in autistic people. Functional                      imaging shows activation of the same brain                      structures as those used to decode empathy. As a                      neocortical activity (frontal and parietal                      lobes, insula and, amygdala), communicative                      yawning is a sign of involuntary empathy (Helt,                      2010; Senju, 2010).
 
One can conclude that through evolution, a                      behavior can be recycled for different purposes                      according to the increasing complexity of the                      central nervous system, correlated with the                      richness of social interactions.
 
Neuropharmacology of                      yawning
Most of the significant advances towards our                      understanding of the neuropharmacological                      regulation of yawning have been made during the                      past 50 years. We now know that a variety of                      neurotransmitters and neurohormones are involved                      in the induction and regulation of yawning,                      including acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamate,                      serotonin, oxytocin, gamma-aminobutyric acid                      (GABA), opioids, adrenergics, nitric oxide, as                      well as the pro-opiomelanocortic-derived                      peptides, e.g., adrenocorticotropic and                      alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormones (ACTH and                      alpha-MSH, respectively). Most yawning is                      mediated by at least 3 distinct pathways, all of                      which appear to converge on cholinergic neurons                      within the hippocampus, despite the diverse set                      of neurotransmitters involved. In addition, the                      importance of the hypothalamus (parvocellular                      nucleus, PVN) in regulating yawning has been                      demonstrated, as many of these neurotransmitters                      appear to affect yawning through their                      interactions with oxytocinergic neurons within                      the PVN. For instance, activation of these                      oxytocinergic neurons by dopamine, glutamate,                      nitric oxide and oxytocin is known to induce                      yawning, whereas inhibition of these neurons by µ-opioids and GABA has been shown to reduce                      the frequency of yawning. It is important to                      note that although the effects of ACTH and                      alpha-MSH are also mediated by the hypothalamus,                      the induction of yawning by these peptides does                      not involve oxytocinergic neurons. Similarly,                      the induction of yawning by serotonin is known                      to occur independent of oxytocinergic neurons                      within the PVN; however, the brain regions                      responsible for serotonergic yawning are                      currently unknown.
 
Despite the great advances made towards our                      understanding of the neuropharmacological                      regulation of yawning, further studies are                      needed to fully elucidate how these                      neurotransmitter systems interact with each                      other, as well as the specific receptor subtypes                      and brain regions involved in the induction and                      inhibition of yawning. Such an understanding                      would not only advance the use of yawning as a                      tool for the pharmacological characterization of                      receptor subtype-selective agonists,                      partial-agonists and antagonists, but also                      further our knowledge of how a variety of                      environmental and pharmacological manipulations                      (i.e. dietary conditions or chronic drug                      treatments) affect the receptor systems involved                      in mediating yawning. In addition, a more                      complete understanding of the                      neuropharmacological regulation of yawning could                      also provide insight into the specific roles of                      different neurotransmitter systems and/or                      receptor subtypes in the occurrence of yawning,                      under a variety of physiological conditions and                      disease states in which changes in the frequency                      of yawning are known to occur (Collins,                      2010).
 
OLD THEORIES NOW CONSIDERED                      FALSE
Life, in all its aspects, has always given                      rise to thought and questioning. Explanations of                      physiological phenomena have always provided us                      with reassurance. As noted by Henry Louis                      Mencken (1880-1956): "Explanations exist and                      have always existed, because there is always a                      simple solution to each human problem, a clear                      solution that is plausible and false" (Mencken,                      1934). . The history of knowledge on yawning is                      a perfect example of this precept. The causes                      and consequences of this intriguing phenomenon                      have defied the human mind for centuries. The                      most ancient theory on yawning was applied in De                      flatibus liber, "a treatise on wind" written by                      Hippocrates in 400 BC. He observed: "Yawning                      precedes a fever, because the large quantity of                      air that has accumulated ascends all at once,                      lifting with the action of a lever and opening                      the mouth; in this manner the air can exit with                      ease. Like the large quantities of steam that                      escape from cauldrons when water boils, the                      accumulated air in the body is violently                      expelled through the mouth when the body                      temperature rises". This idea persisted until                      the 17th century (de Mercy, 1831).
 
Santori Santorio (1561-1636) or Sanctorius                      of Padua was a physician in Venice and student                      and friend of Galileo. He may be considered as                      one of the founders of experimental physiology.                      He tried to quantify physiological and                      pathological phenomena with measuring devices                      such as the scale, the thermometer and the                      metronome. With a scale of his own invention, he                      measured and compared weight gain and loss in                      humans, particularly by perspiration. He built                      an entire medical theory based on the weight                      differences related to nutrition, releases via                      the emunctories and perspiration, calling it                      static medicine. He mentioned yawning in his                      aphorisms: "Yawning and limb extension after                      sleep show that the body perspires abundantly,                      similar to the rooster that flaps its wings                      before it starts to sing. The urge to yawn and                      stretch the limbs upon waking stems from the                      abundance of perspirable matter, creating an                      inclination to perspire. Through yawning and                      limb extension, we perspire more in one half                      hour than we would during other times in three                      hours" (Santori, 1634).
 
Johannes de Gorter (1689-1762), a prolific                      Dutch author in all areas of medicine in the                      early 18th century, holds a key place in the                      history of knowledge on yawning. In his book, De                      Perspiratione insensibili in 1755, he attributed                      yawning "to a need for faster blood circulation                      and to cerebral anemia" (de Gorter, 1725). This                      marks the birth of an idea that would persist                      for two centuries, repeated by almost all                      authors: yawning improves brain oxygenation.                      This hypothesis seems to predict that yawning is                      triggered when blood or brain oxygenation is                      insufficient, i.e. when oxygen (O2) levels drop                      and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration rises.                      Provine et al. demonstrated, in 1987, that                      healthy subjects who are exposed to gas mixtures                      with high levels of CO2 or to physical exercise,                      do not yawn more frequently. Similarly, high                      levels of O2 had no influence on the yawning                      rate (Provine, 1987). Although hypoxia is                      frequent in patients with heart or lung disease,                      no increased yawning is usually observed in                      these patients. Yawning in the human fetus and                      in fish also rules out this hypothesis. During                      periods of low blood oxygenation, yawning does                      not increase and thus cannot improve brain                      oxygenation .
 
HYPOTHESES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN                      EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED
A number of other hypotheses have arisen                      over time. Cahill (1978) argued that yawning                      prevents lung atelectasis; Pellatt et al. (1981)                      suggested that the thyroid gland may be                      compressed during yawning with the resultant                      liberation of thyroid hormones; Forrester (1988)                      presumed that yawning renews surfactant film in                      the lungs; McKenzie (1994) thought that yawning                      may enhance the evacuation of the tonsilar                      fossae.
 
Because yawning opens the Eustachian tubes                      and therefore ventilates the tympanal cavities,                      Laskiewicz, in 1953, postulated that yawning may                      be a "defence reflex" to equalise air pressures                      in the ear, triggered by altitude changes or                      other conditions leading to air trapping in the                      middle ear.
 
Matikainen et al. (20008) argue that yawning                      causes movements and compressions that may                      affect the carotid body that is situated                      strategically at the bifurcation of the common                      carotid artery. Thus, yawning may stimulate the                      carotid body, by compression. The carotid body                      is a chemosensory organ that monitors blood                      chemicals and initiates compensatory reflex                      adjustments to maintain homeostasis. The                      'afferent' sensory discharge induced by changes                      in blood chemicals, e.g. low PO2 (hypoxia), is                      relayed by carotid sinus nerve fibers. A                      parallel autonomic (parasympathetic) 'efferent'                      pathway that is the source of carotid body                      inhibition is less known. These autonomic                      neurons are embedded in 'paraganglia' within the                      glossopharyngeal and carotid sinus nerves. While                      the phylogeny of the carotid arteries is well                      established, the phylogeny of the carotid body                      is not. There has been a reduction in the                      distribution of peripheral respiratory O2                      chemoreceptors from multiple, dispersed sites in                      fish and amphibia to a single dominant receptor                      site in birds and mammals. In the process, the                      cells in the fish gill associated with O2                      chemosensing are replaced by the glomus cells of                      the mammalian carotid body. Though it is, with                      or without carotid bodies, all these vertebrates                      yawn widely (Campanucci, 2007; Milsom,                      2007).
 
All these theories do not explain the                      association of yawning with arousal and                      sleepiness. None of these proposals have been                      experimentally tested and there is currently no                      evidence for such mechanisms.
 
Why a fetal yawn?
The advent of ultrasound technology in the                      1970s enabled live, unobtrusive observations of                      fetal behaviors in humans, vastly increasing our                      knowledge of many types of subtle motor activity                      (swallowing, respiratory movements, smiling, and                      yawning) and thus human fetal development.                      Yawning is a phylogenetically old and thus                      ontologically precocious behavior. Ultrasound                      investigation reveals its onset between 11 and                      15 weeks of gestation. The fact that yawning has                      survived without evolutionary variations                      suggests its importance in terms of                      developmental need. The strong muscular                      contraction involved in yawning has a                      metabolically expensive cost. If we agree with                      the terms of the Darwin's evolutionary                      propositions, the cost in brain activity must be                      outweighed by the advantages gained in terms of                      developmental fitness. Thus, a structural                      hypothesis suggests an activating role in                      neurotrophin synthesis, leading to a cascade of                      both new synapse formation or recruitment and                      activation throughout the diencephalon,                      brainstem and spinal cord. The phenomenon of                      activity-dependent development has been clearly                      shown to be one mechanism by which early sensory                      or motor experience can affect the course of                      neural development. Activity-dependent                      development may be a ubiquitous process in brain                      maturation by which activity in one brain region                      can influence development in other regions. It                      must be specified that human research on                      prenatal programming of behavior is                      intrinsically correlational, never                      manipulatively experimental, and frequently                      based upon homologies with other vertebrates                      (Almli, 2001; Petrikovsky, 1999; van Woerden,                      2008; Walusinski, 2010).
 
CURRENT THEORIES UNDER SCIENTIFIC                      DISCUSSION
In this section, we will only discuss                      universal vertebrate yawning, i.e. the oldest                      yawning in phylogenetic terms, which is                      generated by the reptilian brain.
 
The arousal-sleepiness                      hypothesis
Each individual, based on his or her own                      experience, realizes the link that exists                      between fatigue, sleepiness and yawning.                      Monotonous circumstances lead to yawning, e.g.                      idle waiting, public transportation and long                      periods of motorway driving. A correlation                      exists between the degree of sleepiness and the                      increased yawning frequency. Furthermore,                      yawning exhibits a circadian rhythm. Following                      sleep, it is more frequent and associated with                      stretching (the term pandiculation is used,                      referring to yawning together with generalised stretching of anti-gravity muscles). It is also                      more frequent during the drowsiness that                      precedes sleep (Giganti, 2010). Herbivores, who                      sleep less and have shorter periods of                      paradoxical sleep than carnivores or frugivores,                      yawn less often. Yawning and pandiculation lead                      to maximum opening of the upper respiratory                      tract and increase muscle tone in anti-gravity                      muscles. All motor activity results in adaptive                      feedback. The strong muscular contraction                      involved in yawning and pandiculation initiates                      sensory feedback, via the somatosensory tract                      (posterior funiculus), with projection to the                      locus ceruleus (trigeminal-cervical-spinal                      sensorimotor loops), the ascending reticular                      activating system in the brainstem and the                      lateral hypothalamus. According to the most                      developed theory at this time, the physiological                      function of yawning is to stimulate vigilance,                      rather than arousal, and also muscle tone,                      through feedback to the above-mentioned                      structures, which play a role in arousal,                      vigilance and muscle tone. One of the main                      arguments for this arousal enhancement derives                      from the observation that yawns are followed by                      a significant increase in motor activity.                      Notwithstanding, sleepy individuals trying to                      stay awake change body positions and move their                      limbs. These movements have an arousing effect                      measurable by EEG, as yawning has (Walusinski,                      2006). For Guggisberg et al. "the increased motor activity observed after yawns is probably                      not an indicator of an arousing affect of                      yawning, but an effective countermeasure against                      the underlying drowsiness". Guggisberg et al.                      have analyzed spectral EEG changes after yawns                      in humans and the results were negative. Yawning                      activates the autonomic system but for                      Guggisberg et al., this is unspecific and                      related to the associated movements and                      respiration. These researchers noticed no                      specific increase in skin conductance                      (indicating increased arousal level) after                      yawning (Guggisberg, 2007). Note that the                      hypothesis explored by Guggisberg was that                      yawning induces arousal, whereas the initial                      theory was to interpret yawning as a means of                      stimulating vigilance and not specifically                      arousal.
 
Role of yawning and pandiculation in                      interoception and the body schema
Given the demonstration that yawning does                      not impact arousal, the theory that vigilance                      rather than arousal is stimulated can be                      reformulated. In the Aristotelian tradition,                      school children learn that we have five senses.                      But we receive information from a sixth sense,                      interoception, which includes proprioception,                      i.e. the ability to perceive sensory stimuli                      inside our bodies. The term interoception,                      related to somaesthesia, was proposed by                      Sherrington, as was the term proprioception                      (Sherrington, 1906). Arousal is essential to                      consciousness, which requires the ability to                      integrate sensory information about the outside                      world as well as our sensations concerning our                      internal physical state, modulated by emotion                      and memory.
 
Afferent sensations from the musculoskeletal                      system converge, via the spinothalamic and                      spinoreticular tracts, on the thalamus and raphe                      nuclei and from there, on the thalamocortical                      tract to the postcentral gyrus in the parietal                      lobe. The thalamus and the paraventricular                      nucleus in the hypothalamus are part of a                      circuit that sends and receives signals from the                      locus ceruleus and the mammillary bodies; all of                      these structures are involved in autonomic                      reflexes. The cranial, trigeminal (V), facial                      (VII) and vagus (X) nerves and the motor and/or                      sensory cervical nerves C1-C4 also convey                      somaesthetic information that converges on the                      nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The NTS is                      an interface for peripheral information needed                      to stimulate the ascending reticular activating                      system in the brain stem, particularly the locus                      ceruleus, which activates arousal systems                      (adrenergic system at the pons, dopaminergic                      system at the peduncles, histaminergic system at                      the hypothalamus and cholinergic system at the                      nucleus basalis of Meynert). The neurons of the NTS project to the parabrachial nucleus, which                      in turn projects to various brain stem,                      diencephalic and thalamic sites. These                      structures also project to the visceral sensory                      area of the insula, amygdala and lateral frontal                      cortex, especially the right lateral frontal                      cortex. These circuits enable a subcortical                      homeostatic activity that is unconscious and                      automatic to result in a conscious                      representation. Autonomic, somatic and limbic                      integration make it possible to extract a bodily                      perception, which may in turn lead to a                      sensation of pleasure (Cameron, 2002; Craig,                      2003; Critchley, 2004). Thus, muscle tone                      variations in peripheral anti-gravity muscles,                      transmitted by these pathways, may trigger                      yawning and pandiculation which, through the                      powerful muscular contractions that accompany                      them, may activate vigilance systems.
 
Our perception of musculoskeletal activity                      therefore brings a feeling of well-being and a                      more acute bodily reflectivity of the self, for                      example during arousal, as proposed by                      James-Lange's theories of emotion or by                      Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis of                      consciousness (James, 1884; Lange, 1885;                      Damasio, 1999).
 
Yawning: an auto-regulatory role in                      the locomotor system
For Bertolucci, "pandiculation seems to be                      elicited by a complex array or sequence of                      stimuli, which might include both exteroceptive                      signals (e.g. light-darkness) and interoceptive                      ones (e.g. circadian endocrine cycles and                      somatic interoception). Yawning is a series of                      coordinated actions that unfold sequentially,                      building up soft tissue contractile tension to a                      peak, at which point the joints of the limbs and                      trunk are maximally extended or, alternatively,                      the trunk is arched in flexion. After the peak,                      the soft tissue tension level plummets, yielding                      a sense of pleasure and well-being. The actions                      can be regional or involve the whole body, and                      are often bilaterally symmetrical". The                      musculoskeletal system is constantly being                      reshaped by the mechanical constraints to which                      it is exposed. For example, prolonged                      immobilisation leads to muscle loss and skeletal                      demineralisation.
 
Bertolucci argues that "pandiculation with                      its specific and vigorous muscle activity, might                      be a means to compensate for the mechanical                      signals delivered by rest periods and                      sub-optimal movements". Yawning might be                      considered a feedback mechanism resulting from                      stiffness, and possibly be triggered by extended                      periods of immobility in asymmetrical positions.                      If the body tends to stiffen, pandiculation "can                      serve to restore the limb (and related musculature) to an original (homeostatic)                      state". [...] "The patterns of                      pandiculation are automatic. Through intense and                      involuntary deep muscle co-contractions, the                      soft tissues actively elongate themselves                      against the bony structures as the joints are                      stiffened. Each movement within the pattern                      emerges in sequence, apparently from the                      recruitment of a mosaic of reflexes, the                      sequence of which can neither be anticipated nor                      purposely performed. Just as a spontaneous yawn                      feels quite different from a deliberate                      imitation of one, spontaneous pandiculation                      feels quite different from a voluntary                      pandiculation-like stretch. Because the                      voluntary and emotional motor systems have                      discrete neural pathways, pandiculation's                      distinctive internal sensations might be                      attributable to the motor unit recruitment                      sequences dedicated to automatic movement                      patterns". [...] "The importance of                      stretching to the maintenance of musculoskeletal                      health is well-known. In humans, each of the                      myriad of physical fitness regimens that include                      stretching has its own rationale; and although                      all muscle groups should be stretched, different                      regimens address particular problems and are                      intended to compensate for various patterns of                      muscle shortness or consequent joint mobility                      restriction. But how do animals in the wild                      maintain musculoskeletal health? They perform no                      voluntary stretching and still maintain their                      motor capabilities". [...] "The                      mechanical balance between hard and soft tissues                      dictates stress distribution, which plays a key                      role in cell shape and metabolism. In                      pandiculation, the intense mechanical stimuli                      produced by forceful co-contraction of                      antagonist muscle groups might serve as                      appropriate organizing signals to the cells and                      tissues by re-optimizing the mechanical                      conditions of their environment".
 
Pandiculation "might be a biological                      compensation for periods of immobility and/or                      vicious body positions, restoring the animal's                      mobility by breaking up abnormal muscle                      metabolism cross-links formed by inactivity or                      suboptimal activity". [...] "Perhaps the                      vigorous co-contractions of pandiculation                      systematically reshape the structural linkage                      among segments and simultaneously signal the                      cells (via mechanotransduction) to synthesize                      the cellular muscle components required to                      maintain the appropriate environment. If so,                      pandiculation might help restore optimal                      musculoskeletal arrangements, and thus optimize                      motor capabilities" (Bertolucci, 2011).
 
The thermoregulation                      hypothesis
The existence of yawning across almost all                      vertebrate species suggests important basic                      functions, and the spontaneous and involuntary                      nature of a yawn lends support for it having                      adaptive significance. Recent research by Andrew                      C. Gallup suggests that a biological function of                      yawning among homeotherms is central                      thermoregulation. Comparative research from                      birds, rats and humans suggests, for them, that                      yawning reduces brain and body temperature and                      is influenced by the range and direction of                      ambient temperature change. According to their                      model, the increased facial and brain                      circulation that follows yawning acts like a                      radiator, by eliminating calories from blood in                      the brain via the face and head and by                      introducing cooler blood from the extremities                      and lungs into the brain. In one of the                      experiments developed by this team, subjects                      wore a refrigerated pack on their foreheads.                      Under these conditions, they were less                      susceptible to contagious yawning than with no                      forehead refrigeration. It should be noted that                      cold temperatures have an arousing effect and                      can by themselves modify the outcome. Other                      experiments on birds in various temperature                      conditions showed an increased frequency in the                      number of yawns with increasing temperature.                      However, no other parameters that could                      interfere with this finding were taken into                      consideration, which significantly limits the                      scientific value of this study (Gallup, 2010,                      2011).  In a recent experiment, Gallup et al.                      explore the relationship between brain                      temperature and yawning after they have                      implanted thermocoupled probes in the frontal                      cortex of rats to measure brain temperature                      before, during and after yawning. Temperature                      recordings indicate that yawns and stretches                      occurred during increases in brain temperature,                      with brain temperatures being restored to                      baseline following the execution of each of                      these behaviors (ShoupKnox, 2010). They                      conclude: "Decreases in brain temperature                      following a yawn may be the physiological                      mechanism mediating cortical arousal".
 
Furthermore, according to calculations by                      Hannu Elo, this hypothesis is physically                      impossible. It is impossible to lower body                      temperature through yawning, unless the yawns                      result in heavy perspiration. Similarly, yawning                      cannot lower brain temperature, which would                      require water evaporation (lungs and respiratory                      tract), loss by conduction, thermal radiation                      and a slowdown in metabolism (Elo, 2010, 2011).                      In addition, this theory overlooks the existence                      of fetal yawning and yawning in poikilotherms                      such as reptiles. For these reasons, the                      hypothesis of brain cooling through yawning                      obviously requires further analysis, with due                      consideration given to anatomy and physiology as                      well as the actual need, if any, to cool the                      brain.
 
Yawning and the cerebrospinal fluid                      system
Domenico Cotugno was the first, in 1764, to                      evoke the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid                      (CSF) (Cotugno, 1988). The beating of the heart                      and the movements associated with breathing                      cause pressure variations in the ventricular                      system. Each deep inhalation is followed be an                      increase in CSF flow rate in the fourth                      ventricle (Schroth, 1992).
 
Jaw kinematics, together with inhalation,                      has been shown to alter intracranial                      circulation. Lepp (1982) describes jaw                      kinematics as follows. Jaw movements activate                      the pterygoid musculovenous pump, located in the                      upper part of the anterior parapharyngeal space,                      known as the prestyloid parapharyngeal space. As                      a result, this pump, also known as the paratubal                      pump, can impact the mechanism of venous blood                      flow out of the endocranium, mainly via the                      plexus venosus foraminis ovalis. The pterygoid                      cistern, a component of this pump, corresponds                      to the cavernous part of the pterygoid plexus.                      It is an extracranial extension of the cavernous                      sinus and passes through the foramen ovale. It                      plays an important role as an intermediary                      station of acceleration for return blood flow                      from the brain (Bouyssou, 1985 ; Patra, 1988).                      Lepp notes that it would be reasonable to                      consider jaw kinematics together with the                      lateral pterygoid muscle as a venous trigger,                      given that they act as the starter for the                      alternating musculovenous pumping action that                      takes place in the cavernous part of the                      pterygoid plexus. This pumping action is                      particularly efficient during isolated yawning,                      especially when the mouth reaches its maximum                      opening. However, Lepp emphasizes that yawning                      itself is often merely the initiation of a                      musculovenous motor chain reaction, which                      extends to the limbs and the entire skeletal                      musculature as tonic waves propagated in the                      rostrocaudal direction to the ends of the                      fingers and toes (Lepp, 1982).
 
It would thus appear that the large                      inhalation and maximum opening of the mouth                      accelerate the circulation of CSF. Already in                      1912, Legendre and Piéron demonstrated                      the presence of a hypnogenic factor in the CSF,                      which accumulates during the waking state                      (Legendre, 1912). Research into the hormonal,                      non-neuronal factors that induce sleep, which                      has been conducted for nearly 100 years, has                      identified over 50 molecules. Of current                      interest is the prostaglandin PGD2, a hormone                      that acts locally and is produced by the                      meninges. When it binds to a specific receptor,                      transduction occurs from the leptomeninges to                      brain parenchyma through the activation of                      adenosine production, which induces sleep in the                      ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) nucleus of the                      anterior hypothalamus (Huang, 2007, 2011).                      Yawning and pandiculation may accelerate                      clearance of PGD2, thus reducing sleepiness.                      They may also act on other neuromediators that                      are currently unknown.
 
CONCLUSION
We close this survey of the different                      functional theories on yawning, none of which                      have been scientifically demonstrated, by                      proposing that yawning appears to be a                      homeostatic process involving circadian                      variations in vigilance and emotion. Yawning                      externalizes a parasympathetic stimulation                      during the balancing of adrenergic and                      cholinergic homeostasis of the autonomic                      nervous. Thus, yawning seems closer to a                      behavioral stereotypy than to a reflex. This is                      indeed a curious behavioral display and is a                      beautiful example of an involuntary expression                      that is pleasurable and that we, as humans, use                      voluntarily to deliberately communicate                      boredom.
