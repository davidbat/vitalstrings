cause they are tired! kidding
Why yawn? ...Why do we yawn?  Yawning cleans the brain.
At the deepest part of the breath when the lungs have the greatest force, the lungs fill up the ribcage, then lift the ribs.The ribs lift the spine and the force is transferred from the top of the spine to a bone of the skull called the occipital bone. The occipital bone forms most of the seat for the brain, and it is pushed upward.
At the same moment the fully expanded lungs push away from the ribs and the bronchi are forced apart or away from each other. The bronchi are attached to the bronchi tubes causing them to pull down on the trachea as it all expands.
The trachea pulls down on the thyroid. The thyroid is attached to the hyoid bone by the thyrohyoid membrane, which pulls evenly on the hyoid bone.  The hyoid bone, which is being pulled downward, is attached to the skull by ligaments and muscle at two points called the styloid process of the temporal bones. The two temporal bones are on each side of the occipital bone. The styloid processes are the two thorn-like protrusions where the muscles and ligaments attach from the hyoid bone to the temporal bones.
While the temporal bones are being pulled downward on each side of the occipital bone, the occipital bone is being pushed up between them. and that makes you yawn.it's like stretching ure face.
hope this helps.
