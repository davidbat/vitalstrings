Yawning is always thought to signify tiredness, sleepiness, stress or simply a lack of interest. But it can be an indicator of many other physiological phenomena and also a part of the social behavior of animals.
A yawn is contagious, in the sense that it can easily spread to the person who is observing the other person yawning. Besides observing, even reading or thinking about it is also found to stimulate yawning in some individuals. Some are of the opinion that it may be caused by mirror neurons present in the frontal cortex of the brain, which imitates the action of others. These neurons get activated when exposed to a stimulus or action performed by another individual usually from the same species. As yawning keeps the brain cool and alert, it is also thought to be an evolutionary development, through which a group of animals can be kept alert and vigilant against possible danger. Many researchers also believe that yawning is an empathic behavior that happens naturally. Contagious yawning is also considered to be a herd instinct used to communicate tiredness and time to sleep, to other individuals in a group.
Thus, yawning is not only associated with tiredness, sleepiness and some physiological conditions, but is also a form of non-verbal communication that can be interpreted to mean several different things. Apart from these, it has given rise to some really interesting beliefs or superstitions. To the ancient Greeks and Mayans, yawning was a sign which indicated that the soul of the person yawning was trying to run away from the body. Another common belief is that one should always cover the mouth while yawning, otherwise the soul may escape from the body. These beliefs may have originated to discourage public yawning, and also to maintain public health, as yawning might facilitate the spread of diseases.
