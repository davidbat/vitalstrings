Low oxygen in the lungs or bloodstream will not trigger a yawn or breath response. Asphyxiation often occurs when people breathe inert gas (such as nitrogen or helium) where there is no oxygen, and the body does not provide feedback as to the lack of oxygen. People who are asphyxiating often have no idea that there is a problem, before they pass out. If oxygen gets below 19.5 but still higher than about 14%, a person might feel light headed without passing out, but there are no other symptoms. Most people who die from breathing helium out of a helium balloon become light headed and fall, breaking their necks, as opposed to death from asphyxiation (this is much more common than generally assumed).
What causes a yawn (or suffocation spasms) is the build-up of carbon dioxide, which occurs when breathing becomes shallow and breathing does not fully expel waste air from the lungs. CO2 in the bloodstream is easily detectable, because it forms carbonic acid. The body responds to this change in chemistry.
