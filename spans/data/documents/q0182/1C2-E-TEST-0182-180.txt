My pinky bone snap ouf of place, how do i snap it surrounded by place again?
THE TRUTH IS that we don’t completely have a handle on why people, or animals for that matter, yawn. It’s widely assumed that yawning occur because we are tired or bored or because we see someone else doing it, but there isn’t any hard evidence to support these beliefs.
The most plausible explanation, and the one to be exact taught in medical university, is that we yawn because oxygen levels in our lungs are low. Studies enjoy shown that during normal, at-rest breathing, we don’t use anywhere near our lung dimensions; for the most part, we just use the upper air sacs at the bottom of the lungs. If the air sac, called alveoli, don’t get fresh nouns, they partially collapse and the lungs stiffen a bit. As a result, it’s believed, our brain prompts the body to either sigh or clutch a yawn to get more air into the lungs.
But unshakable aspects of yawning remain even more mysterious. Fetuses, for instances, have been observed yawning contained by the womb, yet it’s known that they don’t pinch oxygen in through their lungs. And yawning seems to be a symptom of multiple sclerosis and other medical conditions, for reason unclear.
Another puzzling phenomenon is that some male animals, men included, yawn contained by association with penile erection (although it’s presumptuous to assume they’re bored with their sex lives).

We don't knwo for sure but your body wants more oxygen when you do. you can yawn if your not tired it's that when your tired you don't do a lot of things that cause you to enjoy more oxygen :) thats why you yawn more when your tired
