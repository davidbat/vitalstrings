Why Are We Here? A Question for All Generations
Why are we here? This question has both plagued and challenged mankind for generations. Is there an ultimate answer, or is it all about mission statements and self-determination? If we are willing to accept the Bible as truth, then we know the answer to "where did we come from?" According to Scripture, we were created by God. So the next question isâ€¦why? After all, He is God, and as such, He certainly doesn't need us for anything -- so why did He create us?
Why Are We Here? What the Bible Says
"Why are we here?" is a question that can best be answered by looking at how the Bible explains it. Beginning in Genesis Chapter 1, we read that after each phase of creation, God "saw that it was good." According to Scripture, once He completed creating the heavens and the earth, the plant life and all the animals, He created man:
So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them (Genesis 1:27).
This tells us what God did, but still doesn't explain exactly why He did it. We read on and discover that He spoke well of the male and female and showed His pleasure by entrusting them with His creation:
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,
As part of His blessing, He gave us stewardship over the earth and its other life forms:
and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so (Genesis 1:28-30).
At the end of Genesis Chapter 1, we read how He felt about his completed creation:
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day (Genesis 1:31).
Why Are We Here? The Logical Conclusion
Why are we here? God created us because it pleased Him to do so. This message is consistent throughout the pages of Scripture, and nowhere said more succinctly than by the Apostle John in Revelation 4:11, where he has a vision of Heaven and witnesses the four elders prostrate before the Lord of all Creation, saying:
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
We are created for His pleasure. From the first page of Scripture to the last, that message is clear. We are created for His pleasure. Further, the Apostle Paul wrote in Colossians 1:16: For by Him were all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers: all things were created by Him and for Him.
If we accept that all this is true, and that any other answer is both illogical and devoid of hope, then the next question to ask is - what do we do about it? Or more to the point, what do you and I do about it?
Why Am I Here? Making it Personal
Having concluded that mankind exists to please God, the challenge becomes personal. What do I do about it? How can I, me, one person - possibly please such a big, huge, infinite God? The Bible gives us those answers too. For now, we can rest in this truth - none of us is here by accident. We were planned and wanted by our Heavenly Father from before the beginning of time (Psalm 139).
