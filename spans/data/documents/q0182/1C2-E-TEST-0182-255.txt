Thanks for your reply
He's only about... 7 weeks old, I'd say.
The hiccups are just like a persons hiccup. Sort of body shuddering and jumpy like. Not just located in his head. Doesn't look like head bobbing.
The temp would be about 37c on the warm side, right up near the light, so 98f. He's got a 30 gallon tank with lots of levels and hides to escape the heat or get up closer to it
So they can yawn
Cool. I was trying to google it and didn't come up with much. I figured lizards may 'yawn' for one reason or another... but I do wonder if this is a RI. My friend found a reptile vet (yay) and has made an appointment. Hopefully it's nothing... It's better to be safe though
Thanks again for your answer
