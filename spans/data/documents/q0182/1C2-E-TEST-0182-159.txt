It's reassuring that there are others out there...thanks a lot for the article. 
I talked to my doctor about it, as the article suggests, and he told me I had sports-induced asthma.  But the puffer doesn't change a thing and the reflex isn't climate-sensitive like most asthma symptoms. 
I was beginning to think it was purely psychological, which doesn't change anything, but it gives me something to work with. 
I thought that stretching before sports was a no-no?  Like, you're not supposed to stretch out a muscle before making it work(?)  My trainer at the gym and my tri coach both said never to stretch before effort.  I like the idea, but if it could cause injury...well, that would suck.  Thanks anyway for the suggestion; it makes sense.
Hmm, more research is in order here, I think...
