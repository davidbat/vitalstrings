I have been have muscle spasms under my left breast, I occasionaly get sharp pains in that spot. And like a week ago when I breathed in, the top of my left shoulder hurt, and I got like a muscle spasm in my left arm. Im super worried and Im not sure what it is, but then again I always worry. So Im not sure if I should be worried about this or not? Im a teenager and I told my parents about this and they said its probally from new excercise`s I`ve been doing in schooll but I dont think so. I also have asthma, and I have heart burn occasionaly

Someone said: I take Prilosec for heart burn, Xyzal for allergys, and Vitamin D. I am underwieght for my age, and I dance everyday. I was called into the school nurse in Elementry and they thought I have scholiosis, but I never went to the doctor to check this out. The reason Im telling you this is becuase I want you to know what all i have wrong, so someone can like "diagonose" meish. like to calm my nerves, Im super worried. Im not sure, if i should go to the doctor or what?
