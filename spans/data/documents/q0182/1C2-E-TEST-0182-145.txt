So why are yawns contagious?

Does that mean we tend to yawn more during the summer?

I may seem a bit anal retentive when I make this note, but it irks me (ever so slightly) when I hear “brains are like computers”. It is much more accurate to say that computers are like our brains. Whatever. I know they’re just using a microcosm to explain a more complicated system, but it just bugs the crap out of me.

Hmm, so it’s not actualy because your body is not getting enough oxygen?  I wonder if we are limited in the amount we are actualy able to process due to heat, much like a computer’s CPU.  Would that mean if cybernetics gets to the point of being able to implant features into the brain, we could get heat sinks to allow better cooling to increase our ability to think?

Yes gaulder you are right, it is from not having enough oxygen, not to “cool” the brain that is the most ridiculos thing ive ever heard, my dads a doctor and i am a RN and have never heard of “yawning to cooling the brain” I mean think about it, how exaclty would that work, there is no way that a brisk wind can shoot from your mouth to your brain to “cool” it lol thats just funny to me

I’m calling shenanigans on this one. Beeeky’s got it right – why would simply looking at a picture of a yawn make you want to yawn then if it’s all about brain temperature? And shouldn’t this mean that cold people never yawn? Smacks of the sort of thing that went about years ago, about how women shouldn’t learn maths because their brains would overheat. And just as ridiculous.

I am glad this guy got his 15 minutes, but its BS.
