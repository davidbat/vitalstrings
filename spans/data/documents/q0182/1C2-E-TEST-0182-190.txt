Why We Yawn and Why Is It So Contagious
Out of no where you heard a laud yawning sound that lasted about six seconds.  Not even your thick hard cubical wall can shelter you from hearing that sound.  About five minutes later, you heard another person made a big monstrous yawn.   Then you heard another.  This time the yawning is much lauder.  All of a sudden, you realize its coming from Dan who’s cubical is right next to yours.
You thought to yourself, “Since I am so close to Dan’s cubical, I might be next! Am I going to be infected with this contagious yawning?” With all of your mental might, you push that thought away thinking that your thick cubical wall will prevent that contagious yawning from reaching you.  Besides, even if it passes that mighty and great wall of cubical, you still have your never ending piles of paper work that can be used as a shield.
Suddenly, a big, huge, colossal, and very audible yawning sound fills the air.  Everyone in your quiet little work space can hear this super ultimate yawning sound that lasted for about six seconds.
This time, the person making that yawning sound was you.  You just realized you have became a victim.  You have been infected with the contagious yawn.  You begin to ask yourself, “Why is yawning so contagious and why do we yawn?”
Why is yawning so contagious and why do we yawn?
We yawn whether we are tired or bored.  Once one person yawns other people start to follow.  No one knows why we yawn.  The thought is that yawing help synchronize the human behavior and that it synchronize a group of people into the same state of being.
