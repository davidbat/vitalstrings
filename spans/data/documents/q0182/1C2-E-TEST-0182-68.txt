how come that we close our eyes when we yawn nobody noticed ??? maybe our eyes need rest that's one theory second maybe our eyes are to dry... maybe our face muscles need to stretch just like we stretch our feet and arms etc it can trigger yawning and also explain why weï»¿ do it in the morning to soften up the muscles. and yes we do yawn when we are bored maybe again we need to soften up the muscles... Make more sense that all of this bullshit just like we tend to stretch our arms etc when bored..
