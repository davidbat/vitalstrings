i have this too! no it cant be prevented unless you make your yawn smaller. when you yawn, your face scrunches up for the extra intake of air (when you yawn, it actually means you need more oxygen) your face muscles tighten and squeeze your eyes. in many people, this applies pressure to the tear ducts, so they water.

Oh okay, now I get why it happens. Thanks very much for your feedback, and it's nice to know I'm not the only one, because when I'm at school, it seems like it's just me.
Thank you very much for your clarification and help :D
