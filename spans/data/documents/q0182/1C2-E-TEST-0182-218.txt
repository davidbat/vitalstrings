All the people's yawns from newborn babies to the oldest great-grandparent and animals yawn too. But why, exactly, there are many thoughts about, why people yawn.Yawns oxygenate blood by widening and aerating the tiny lung sac called alveoli, and by expelling carbon dioxide from lungs. If you see public yawing as they come out of the theater, do not assume that it was a terrible movie. Unlike to popular opinion, is not necessarily a sign of boredom. If you yawn, it simply indicates that you need more oxygen, and it is nothing but a reflex that forces oxygen in to your lungs.
Another explanation is that yawning stretches the lungs and lung tissue. Stretching and yawning may be a way to flex muscles and joints, increase heart rate, and feel more awake. The body's oxygen supply is depleted after a long period of shallow breathing, which commonly occurs when you are tired, under stress, or have been sitting still for a long period of time. Yawning is not a sign of illness or abnormality, yawning rarely occurs during serious mental or physical disorder.
We yawn due to, our bodies are trying to get rid of extra carbon dioxide and to take in more oxygen. This may make some reason. When people are getting bored or tired, they respire more slowly. As breathing slows down, lesser oxygen makes it to the lungs. As a result carbon dioxide grow up in the blood, and a message to the brain outcome in signals back to the lungs stating that, "Take a deep breath," and a yawn is a outcome.
