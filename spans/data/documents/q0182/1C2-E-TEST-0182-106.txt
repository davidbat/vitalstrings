The cause of yawning is still widely debated.  Most of us will associate yawning with tiredness or boredom, and you will most  probably have been a victim of contagious yawning!
If yawning occurs when  you are tired, there are theories that suggest it is because we need to get rid  of more carbon dioxide and inhale more oxygen. When we are tired our bodies  slow down, meaning our breathing does too, hence why we need to decrease the  carbon dioxide and increase the oxygen. By yawning we then allow a greater  amount to leave/enter our bodies.
