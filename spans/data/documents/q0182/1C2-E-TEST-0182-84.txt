Why do we yawn? - Question and Answer Human Body.
Why do we yawn?
We yawn more often when we have to sleep, but also when our stomach cries out for hunger or when we are bored.
Other circumstances, such as travel sickness or the approach of an illness, can also provoke yawning. Even a fetus yawns during intrauterine life.
It is practically impossible to suppress a yawn, since it is an automatic behavior.
A yawn includes three phases: a long inhalation, an apnea (a brief stop in inhalation) and then rapid exhalation. These three phases are followed by a sensation of well-being and relaxation.
The principle is that we inhale a huge quantity of oxygen all in one go, which is what feeds the organisms and the brain, giving ourselves a small boost and also stimulating our vigilance.
