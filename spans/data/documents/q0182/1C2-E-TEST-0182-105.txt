There are a lot of theories out there about why we yawn. Some say it's a signal that the body needs more oxygen or an evolutionary tool to help keep us alert. But new research suggests that a yawn actually serves as air conditioning for the brain. A renowned "yawning expert" recently completed a study that found that yawns are a reaction to an overheated brain. The brain, he says, works best when it's cool and yawning helps to bring down the temperature in the brain. That may explain why those who breathe through the nose yawn less frequently, because breathing through the nose naturally cools the brain.
The study played on the well known fact that yawns are contagious and researchers showed participants videos of people yawning. When subjects breathed through their nose and held cold compresses to their heads, they yawned less often than those who breathed through their mouths and held warm compresses to their heads. It's an interesting study with surprising findings, and you can learn more about it by watching this video .
