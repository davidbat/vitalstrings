I yawned during most of the episode . Seriously. :-)

Should the Mythbusters experiment be listed as a source here? I'm not sure if their methods always hold up to scientific standards. — Ocatecir Talk 05:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
I watched the episode. No, it should definitely not be listed as a source. The control group yawned 25% of the time, while the experimental yawned 29%. With only 50 participants, 25 for each side, the difference there is only 1. That is about as inconclusive as an experiment can get. Their methods were more or less sound, but the group was too small for such a minute difference to be confirmed. If this is listed, it should not be listed as "partly confirmed"; rather, it should be listed as inconclusive. I'll do that right now.
Frazz 19:19, 25 July 2007 (UTC)
Mythbusters never does anything properly. I can recall a number of "myths" that actually is plausible and vice versa. The specific episode in question is actually one of their better ones, but, as already stated, the myth was considered partly confirmed despite the inconclusion of their experiment.

[ edit ] Yawning "Contagious"
I think that this portion of the article is in need of revision. I did a search through EBSCOhost for 'contagious yawning' and the search returned several abstracts- I didn't have access to the full text of the articles- saying that the neural mechanism of action for contagious yawning exists independently of mirror-neurons. According to the abstract of a study entitled "Contagious Yawning and the Frontal Lobe: an fMRI Study", "Specifically associated with the viewing of the contagious yawn was an area of activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest a role for the prefrontal cortex in the processing of contagious yawning, while demonstrating a unique automaticity in the processing of contagious motor programs which take place independently of mirror neuron networks." Several other articles stated approximately the same thing, so I think that the portion of the article ascribing contagious yawning to mirror neurons should be either removed or modified. Jonathon Cunningham ( talk ) 00:42, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
Hasn't really been mentioned anywhere in the article (besides a useless link at the bottom) that when someone yawns, another person usually yawns as well. Just wondering if someone could add it to the article, list speculated reasons as to why, etc. Code E 02:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
See the paragraph which begins: "The yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, ...". -- Quiddity 02:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
One of the possible hypothesis given in the article for yawning being contagious is the lack of air around the ears of the second person yawning. This doesn't hold ground as yawning is seen to be contagious even when we seee anyone yawning on TV without the person actually physically "changing the air pressure" around our ears.
I was actually a fan of the ear pressure theory, but then I realized that I was yawning countless times as I was reading the article. Heck, I yawned twice just typing this.

[ edit ] Animals that yawn
Is there an article on this? I just saw a video where a snake yawns, so how deep does the yawning reflex extend in animals? Obviously insects don't yawn (etc) but there must a clear line where yawning stops.
—The preceding unsigned comment was added by 83.145.224.14 ( talk • contribs ).
Very good question - and another point: Has it evolved independently or does it show common ancestry? Added to to-do list. Richard001 01:02, 27 May 2007 (UTC)
I think it sounds rather difficult a task. Firstly, how does one determine whether an animal makes the "yawning" voluntarily or not? The attack stance of certain snakes, and the intimidating growl of certain canines can't really be considered "yawns", but where do we draw that line? Konaya 22:31, 6 August 2007 (UTC)
While reading this article, I had an overwhelming urge to yawn.
I yawned about 5 times reading this article, and am yawning right now.
I must agree! I yawned 4 times while reading it as well! This lends me to believe that 'contagious' yawning is not visual in nature but rather cerebral, meaning that even if the subject of yawning were to come up, it triggers the body's reflex to do so.
rofl that's so funny i just went to this talk page to mention that I yawned twice when i saw this article. oh crap i'm yawning again, no joke
—The preceding unsigned comment was added by 24.225.226.21 ( talk ) 19:15, 5 May 2007 (UTC).
I agree, I was also about to post... Maybe, it is a psychological link between the word yawn, and the action.
P.S. Another theory: Yawning is copied, as when older adults yawned and slept in cave-man times, it signalled to others (Younger, Non-Alpha etc.) that it was safe to sleep.
LOL! I yawned throughout reading the article! -- AJKGordon 17:28, 4 July 2007 (UTC)
Ha, I yawned twice. Gotta be on to something here. 69.37.181.44 06:41, 30 July 2007 (UTC)
Yet another yawner over here... The theory about yawning being cerebral leads me to think that yawning must be socially related, perhaps a means of communication. In any case, I think that the act of yawning and the yawning reflex itself are two separate things, although the former includes the latter. The reflex is probably useful for any said theories, but the real question is what it was originally intended for. Konaya 22:53, 6 August 2007 (UTC)
I yawned too. I'm not really sure what that means, but I think it's definitely significant that so many people have yawned while reading about yawning (granting, the people who aren't yawning aren't posting about it, so we don't really know if it's something that most people do). — Mears man 03:43, 12 September 2007 (UTC)
I can make my dog yawn by either yawning or fake yawning ,I can also force myself to yawn.If yawning is caused by lack of oxygen, wouldn't people that have smoked for a long time be yawning all the time?! ~:Gr8Buzz:~
I purposely revisit this page again and again just so I can truly yawn. Feels soo good.
Oh man, now that I've seen particular this discussion, I've been yawning like crazy lol. Vandalism destroyer ( talk ) 04:16, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

[ edit ] A new yawning hypothesis
I have my own hypothesis about yawning, which is supported by comparing notes with other friends and family: It's caused by hunger, or possibly thirst. This is most evident when travelling somewhere in a car around lunchtime or dinnertime, delaying the normal meal time.
This hypothesis is also supported by observing nature: Chicks in a nest "yawn" when they are still hungry. My theory is that we yawn due to a biological throwback when our ancient parents brought food back to the "nest" and those that were hungry yawned in order to be fed.
This explains several of the odd things about yawning. For example, it explains why we open our mouths as wide as possible (to easily admit food; if it was about oxygen, even a narrow opening would be sufficient). It explains why we close our eyes tightly (to stop food being dropped into them). It explains why we feel the need to accompany the yawn with some noise (to gain attention). It explains why yawns are "contagious" (especially to others who are also hungry).
My reasons for bringing this up on the discussion page are as follows: Do I need to be a scientist, or does this hypothesis need to be scientifically tested, or does the hypothesis need to be widely accepted, prior to adding it to the main page? I'd prefer to firstly gain sufficient consensus that the hypothesis has merit rather than risk my unfounded hypothesis being simply deleted.
Ian Fieggen 22:30, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
Interesting idea.
As for adding it to the article, essentially it first needs to appear in a published (reference-able) place. See Wikipedia:No original research . — Quiddity 23:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
Indeed.
However, there is the possibility that your hypothesis is based on a mere coincidence. Hunger usually induce fatigue. When yawning, one is often affected by both, and that would make it hard to rule out one of the two.
Then, again, there are quite a number of indications in favour of your theory, and it is definitely worthy of note, and possibly further research.
Are there any recognised biologists in the house? Konaya 23:10, 6 August 2007 (UTC)
I'm in serious disagreement with Fieggen's hypothesis. First of all, I ate (and drank) well half an hour ago, yet I yawned a dozen times reading this article and then the discussion (and others have mentioned doing this in this discussion page as well). So that's two incompatibilities (I'm far from hungry and thirsty, and it makes no sense that reading about the concept would act as a trigger if hunger/thirst was the cause). A third one is that it fails to explain the strong correlation between sleepiness/tiredness and yawning. ThVa ( talk ) 13:14, 31 December 2007 (UTC)
Digesting food is not an easy matter. It takes some energy to do it. Hence, the tiredness. Hence, yawning. Reading this article probably helped, too. Who said there must be only one trigger behind yawning? -- Konaya ( talk ) 13:42, 15 June 2008 (UTC)
I have no great answer to ThVa's first and second points, except that perhaps suggestive yawning is triggered by our primitive survival instinct in that simply thinking about others yawning triggers us to copy in order that we don't miss out on a feed. To the third point, if we're still up and about when we're sleepy/tired, our brain tells us we should eat something, so we yawn. My theory doesn't invalidate the correlation between sleepiness/tiredness and yawning, rather, it explains why we feel the need to open our mouths widely, which otherwise seems a pretty odd response to tiredness! Ian Fieggen ( talk ) 00:38, 16 June 2008 (UTC)
Thanks to those who responded to my hypothesis. I've certainly opted against adding anything to the article, and will restrict it to just this thread, where it may or may not be of interest to those doing proper yawning research.
Just one final clarification: Immediately prior to yawning, I didn't even need to have any symptoms of my hunger or thirst, such as through rumblings in the stomach or a dry mouth. It's merely that I noticed that my yawns invariably occurred just before meal times (usually lunch or dinner). Ian Fieggen ( talk ) 00:38, 16 June 2008 (UTC)
Assuming you were relaxed, anticipation will be the trigger for increased bodily activity of having a meal. With yawning being part of the buildup process. See my earlier comment in Physical Process of Yawning . Evanh ( talk ) 22:56, 23 December 2009 (UTC)
[ edit ] Eyes Watering
Whenever I yawn, without fail my eyes water. I thought it happened to everyone, but the article doesn't mention it. 70.57.94.23 18:01, 12 May 2007 (UTC)
It happens to me, too. I always assumed that it was universal as well. Fiasco 03:19, 1 June 2007 (UTC)
Same thing happens to me, must be universal, also if I have a dry mouth and then yawn, I salivate. However, that might just be me. The article should definitely mention something about eyes watering. Perhaps somebody could confirm or disprove the saliva effect? 68.189.67.27 06:34, 12 July 2007 (UTC)
I also salivate, and if I'm not careful, a fine spray sometimes shoots out of my mouth from under my tongue. I've loooked and it comes from two little spouts under the tongue which I imagine must be salivary glands.-- 200.14.108.1 15:13, 27 July 2007 (UTC)
The tearing is due to physical stress on the tear glands during more extreme facial musclework, like laughing (indeed, one can laugh until crying) or yawning.
Regarding salivation, I cannot explain it; although I can account for the "saliva-shooting" the previous writer have experienced, only not during the act of yawning. I can procure this phenomenon at will, merely by tensing my tongue in a certain way. The previous writer probably does this in a similar way when yawning; since yawning tenses a vaste variety of facial muscles, putting considerable strain on the facial tissue, I find it quite surprising that salivation and the inducing of tears are two of the only very few consequences reported. Konaya 23:30, 6 August 2007 (UTC)
[ edit ] The Wind Sound
When I yawn, I hear white noise, much like wind rushing past my ears. I've never read about the cause of this, or, now that I consider it, even another report of it. I assume it's a rapidly modulating contraction of the tensor tympani , or perhaps something else vibrating in my skull. First: is this a noted phenomenon? Second: are auditory phenomena within the scope of the article? Fiasco 03:19, 1 June 2007 (UTC)
I have also noted this noise, I would describe it as a muffled rumbling. It also occurs when trying to restore appropriate pressure on the eardrums (odd way of describing it, I am aware of that, but due to English not being my primary language I fail to find a more suitable expression). The only place I've seen this phenomenon on record is as a brief side note in a book of an irrelevant subject; this have, until now, led me to believe that I am the only one experiencing this. Now, when this belief have been proved wrong, I would much appreciate someone, preferrably with at least little more than a laymans knowledge of medicine, to shed light on this matter. Konaya 00:04, 7 August 2007 (UTC)
That happens to me too! I've been able to make that sound since I was a little kid, and I've never had any way of explaining it. I always thought I was the only one, too. 72.83.108.81 ( talk ) 12:44, 13 August 2008 (UTC)
I can make myself hear a noise from inside my head, but it doesn't sound like white noise nor wind, it sounds like a wet purring like sound. -- TiagoTiago ( talk ) 18:37, 23 November 2009 (UTC)

[ edit ] Mythbusters Episode
The bit about yawning being contagious needs to be edited; "Mythbusters" should not be cited as a source, as their research methods are questionable and unscientific. I myself am not an expert on yawning so I will leave the article as is, in hopes that someone else with more knowledge on the subject can cite some real study on the contagiousness of yawning. -Mark G 65.197.19.242 21:06, 29 June 2007 (UTC)
No offense, but you're being quite presumptuous. The experiment in that particular episode was quite sound, though the results were terribly inconclusive. I do agree with the removal of that particular reference, however, because of the uselessness of it. Anyone agree? ( Frazz 15:54, 13 August 2007 (UTC))
I agree - and I also agree completely with the first argument. No matter how sound Mythbusters' "research" may appear, it falls short of scientific, it isn't properly documented, and doesn't deserve to be cited as a source - let's not mix up science and entertainment! There have been plenty of scientific studies concerning this topic that could take the place of the Mythbusters reference.
Removed. I'm just curios though, isn't video taping everything you do enough to qualify as documented? Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems that recording everything should be sufficient. I'd appreciate it if you cleared this up for me. ( Frazz 22:24, 16 August 2007 (UTC))
PS: You should sign your statements. ( Frazz 22:25, 16 August 2007 (UTC))

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6270036.stm "Rather than being a precursor to sleep, yawning is designed to keep us awake, say US researchers."
[ edit ] Paratroopers yawning?
I don't see why the paratroopers bit is in this article. There is no citation to anything, and it reads like hearsay: "Another speculated reason for yawning is nervousness - paratroopers were once noted yawning right before their first jump, and had just come from a coffee break." Is that something we can mark as "citation needed"? (I'm pretty new here, so I want to be sure that's how others would handle it).
