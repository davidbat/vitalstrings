hum that sounds coherent
and also does contradict Mk's message
sometimes u really feel like u wanna stretch, and u can stop urself from doing it
you can also strecth when u want to
for yawning seems a bit the same, except its a bit harder to control it
-------------------------------------
IF only humans yawn THEN
it has to give an advante over an human who doesnt/cant yawn
because every human on earth yaws
this means that during our evolution, those who didnt yawn must have had at least a small disvantage
ELSE
' same thing , but with the related animals, thus might be really complicated coz we would be going more back in evolution
END IF
