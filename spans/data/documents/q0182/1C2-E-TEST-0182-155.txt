I have had stints of 5 + days with 0 sleep and I can attest to the fact that you loose all concept of time..reasoning becomes difficult and halucinations are definely annoying to say the least.... I would say those times are quite miserable and I would have much preferred sleeping.
talking major grumpy...Lol.. no fun.. I tend to get silly and giggle a lot wen I haven't slept which is ok but I could turn around and be snippy or crying the next minute....
