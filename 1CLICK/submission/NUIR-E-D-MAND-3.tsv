He argued that the consumer society was becoming increasingly hungry for mass-produced electronic items, but the decentralizing effect induced by these very devices gave manufacturers tremendous logistic problems in delivering the items. Smith felt that the necessary delivery speed could only be achieved by using air transport. But, he believed that the US air cargo system was so inflexible and bound by regulations at that time that it was completely incapable of making sufficiently fast deliveries.

The next year, he moved to Chicago, Illinois where he met Alvah C. Roebuck , who joined him in the business. In 1893, the corporate name became Sears, Roebuck and Co. The current Sears location in downtown Chicago is across the street from the historic Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building , which will house a City Target store from the Target Corporation in the near future. The company has been long based in the greater Chicago area, however in 2011 it considered moving the corporate headquarters to Ohio Via the Columbus Dispatch. however a "more generous" tax offering f

1C2-E-0131	OUT	United Kingdom Summer camps are not a mainstream part of childhood in the United Kingdom, in the way they are in North America. The term "summer camp" itself is not considered to be British English ; the industry body is called the British Activity Holiday Association. Camps in the UK are also generally less specialised than that within the United States and most offer a fairly broad Multi-Activity programme of adventure activities alongside some fun social elements. This is partly because summer camps in the UK grew as an off-shoot of the activity holiday industry and were therefore influenced by their adventure-only outdoor programme. The UK has for the past few decades had a number of organisations that have established themselves more along the traditional American Camp model with a very wide range of holiday options as well as themed camps and major event days. Some religious groups, such as the Christadelphians , also run well publicised and attended camps throughout the country.

Lucas designed a new species instead, and says his approach was simple: Wookiees are tall, so he made Ewoks short. The Ewok are named after the Miwok , a Native American tribe, indigenous to the Redwood forest in which the Endor scenes were filmed for Return of the Jedi, near the San Rafael location of Lucas' Skywalker Ranch . The name also is a pun on the syllables of Wookiee in reverse order. In the film, the name "Ewok" is never actually spoken, but it appears in both the script and the closing credits.

Therefore, in order to define accurately the amount to be paid under a legal contract with interest, the frequency of compounding (yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc.) and the interest rate must be specified. Different conventions may be used from country to country, but in finance and economics the following usages are common: Periodic rate: the interest that is charged (and subsequently compounded) for each period, divided by the amount of the principal. The periodic rate is used primarily for calculations, and is rarely used for comparison. The nominal annual rate or nominal interest rate is defined as the periodic rate multiplied by the number of compounding periods per year. For example, a monthly rate of 1% is equivalent to an annual nominal interest of 12%. Effective annual rate : this reflects the effective rate as if

This project was developed in response to traffic congestion on Boston's historically tangled streets, which were laid out long before the advent of the automobile . By mid-20th century, car traffic in the inner city was extremely congested, especially for north–south trips. Commissioner of Public Works William Callahan pushed through plans for an elevated expressway, which eventually was constructed between the downtown area and the waterfront. This "Central Artery" (known officially as the John F. Fitzgerald Expressway) displaced thousands of residents and businesses, and physically divided the historical connection between the downtown and market areas and the waterfront.

The sunlit sky is blue because air scatters short- wavelength light more than longer wavelengths. Since blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The result is that the human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun. The color perceived is similar to that obtained by a monochromatic blue of wavelength 474–476 nm mixed with white light, i.e., an unsaturated blue light. Near sunrise and sunset , most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red. Therefore, when looking at the sunset and sunrise, you will see the color red more than any of the other

1C2-E-0180	OUT	Mechanism The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. This is partly because the cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound. One hypothesis, backed by electromyographic studies, is that cats produce the purring noise by using the vocal folds and/or the muscles of the larynx to alternately dilate and constrict the glottis rapidly, causing air vibrations during inhalation and exhalation. Combined with the steady inhalation and exhalation of air as the cat breathes, a purring noise is produced with strong harmonics . Purring is sometimes accompanied by other sounds, though this varies from cat to cat; in the audio samples that accompany this article, the first cat is only purring, while the vocal production of the second cat contains low level outbursts sometimes characterized as "lurps" or "yowps". Domestic cats purr at a frequency of 25 to 150 vibrations per second. Eklund, Peters & Duthie (2010) , comparing purring in a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) an

However, there are a few theories that attempt to explain the primary evolutionary reason for the yawn. None of them have been empirically substantiated. One study states that yawning occurs when one's blood contains increased amounts of carbon dioxide and therefore becomes in need of the influx of oxygen (or expulsion of carbon dioxide) that a yawn can provide, but studies have since shown it to be either incorrect or, at the very best, flawed. Yawning may in fact reduce oxygen intake compared to normal respiration, not increase it. Another speculated reason for yawning is the desire to stretch one's muscles. Yawns are often accompanied by the urge to stretch. Prey animals must be ready to physically exert themselves at any given moment.

For example, the national mourning was proclaimed and all the state flags were flown at half-mast after the Polish President's plane crash near Smolensk , Russia despite the number of casualties was slightly less than 100. All the regional flags and the departmental ensigns are flown at half-mast on national or regional mourning days as well as the national flag. Firms and non-governmental organizations, embassies and representatives of international organizations often join a mourning, too. The national or regional mourning usually lasts for one day. Saudi Arabia The flag of Saudi Arabia is never flown at half-mast. The flag of Saudi Arabia

1C2-E-0184	OUT	F− 0.000068 Scientific theories behind the origins of sea salt started with Sir Edmond Halley in 1715, who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground. Upon reaching the ocean, these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time (see Hydrologic cycle .) Halley noted that most lakes that don’t have ocean outlets (such as the Dead Sea and the Caspian Sea , see endorheic basin ), have high salt content. Halley termed this process "continental weathering". Halley's theory was partly correct. In addition, sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed. The presence of salt’s other dominant ion, chloride, results from outgassing of chloride (as hydrochloric acid ) with other gases from Earth's interior via volcanos and hydrothermal vents . The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt. Ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years, most likely as a co

1C2-E-0186	OUT	Taxonomy and phylogeny The giant anteater is classifed in the family Myrmecophagidae with the tamanduas . The giant anteater was first classified by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its generic name Myrmecophaga is Greek for "anteater" while its specific name tridactyla is Greek for "three fingers". Zoologist Alfred Gardner has tentatively proposed three subspecies; M. t. tridactyla, M. t. centralis and M. t. artata. The giant anteater is grouped with the semi- arboreal northern and southern tamandua in the family Myrmecophagidae which in turn is grouped with the family Cyclopedidae (whose only extant member is the arboreal silky anteater ) in the suborder Vermilingua . Anteaters and sloths belong to the order Pilosa which is grouped with the order Cingulata ( armadillos ) in the superorder Xenarthra . The two orders split from each other 65 million years ago ( mya ) during the Late Cretaceous . Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 mya, between the Paleocene and Eocene . The silky anteater em

1C2-E-0188	OUT	e Climate (from Ancient Greek klima, meaning inclination) is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period. The standard averaging period is 30 years, but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) glossary definition is: Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather," or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. The difference between climate and weat

1C2-E-0189	OUT	History Until 1992, before construction of the campus, Apple's corporate headquarters were located in the building Mariani One (20525 Mariani Ave, Cupertino). The land east of Mariani One across De Anza Boulevard where the campus was built was formerly occupied by the company Four Phase Systems (later acquired by Motorola ). It has an area of 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2). The campus was completed in 1993 by the Sobrato Development Company. Before 1997, activities held on the campus were exclusively research and development . Until that time the buildings were referred to as R&D 1-6. With return of Steve Jobs to Apple in 1997, changes were made to the campus: Apple increased the number of occupied buildings, and many activities not related to R&D were moved to the buildings on Infinite Loop, at which point they began to be referenced by their IL # designations. Steve Jobs left additional marks on the campus, for example, banning employees' pets and dramatically improving the cafeteri

1C2-E-0190	OUT	Tide changes proceed via the following stages: Sea level rises over several hours, covering the intertidal zone; flood tide. The water rises to its highest level, reaching high tide. Sea level falls over several hours, revealing the intertidal zone; ebb tide. The water stops falling, reaching low tide. Tides produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The moment that the tidal current ceases is called slack water or slack tide. The tide then reverses direction and is said to be turning. Slack water usually occurs near high water and low water. But there are locations where the moments of slack tide differ significantly from those of high and low water. Tides are most commonly semi-diurnal (two high waters and two low waters each day), or diurnal (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters on a given day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the higher high water and the lower high water in tide tables . Similarly, the two low waters each day ar

1C2-E-0191	OUT	Nuclear reactions Nuclear fission splits heavier atoms to form lighter atoms. Nuclear fusion bonds together lighter atoms to form heavier atoms. Both reactions generate roughly a million times more energy than comparable chemical reactions, making nuclear bombs a million times more powerful than non-nuclear bombs, which a French patent claimed in May 1939. In some ways, fission and fusion are opposite and complementary reactions, but the particulars are unique for each. To understand how nuclear weapons are designed, it is useful to know the important similarities and differences between fission and fusion. The following explanation uses rounded numbers and approximations. Main article: nuclear fission When a free neutron hits the nucleus of a fissile atom like uranium-235 ( 235U), the uranium splits into two smaller atoms called fission fragments, plus more neutrons. Fission can be self-sustaining because it produces more neutrons of the speed required to cause new fissions. The urani

1C2-E-0202	OUT	History The government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair declared that " five economic tests " must be passed before the government could recommend the UK joining the euro and promised to hold a referendum on membership if those five economic tests were met. The UK would also have to meet the EU's economic convergence criteria (Maastricht criteria), before being allowed to adopt the euro. Currently, the UK's annual government deficit to the GDP is above the defined threshold. The government committed itself to a triple-approval procedure before joining the Eurozone , involving approval by the Cabinet , Parliament , and the electorate in a referendum . Gordon Brown , Blair's successor, ruled out membership in 2007, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe . In the UK general election 2010 , the Liberal Democrats increased their share of the vote, but lost seats. One of their aims was to see the UK rejoining ERM II and eventually joining the Euro,

1C2-E-0203	OUT	Waste container, Armenia Curbside waste containers usually consist of three types: trash cans (receptacles often made of tin, steel or plastic), dumpsters (large receptacles similar to skips ) and wheelie bins (light, usually plastic bins that are mobile). All of these are emptied by collectors who will load the contents into a garbage truck and drive it to a landfill , incinerator or crusher facility to be disposed of. The standard-sized UK wheelie bin household collection is 240 litres or more. In certain areas there is also a recycling service, often with one or more dedicated bins intended to receive items that can be recycled into new products. These bins are sometimes separated into different categories (usually represented by colours) which determine what materials can be inserted into the bin. The contents of the bins are taken to a recycling plant to be processed, and there are various systems for recycling-bin collection: single-bin-combined stream systems, multiple-bin syste
