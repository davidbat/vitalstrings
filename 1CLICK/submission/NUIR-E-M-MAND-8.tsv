1C2-E-0156	OUT	By far, the greatest vehicle for disseminating the ideals of the Enlightenment was the EncyclopÃ©die, ou Dictionnaire raisonnÃ© des sciences, des arts et des mÃ©tiers, par une sociÃ©tÃ© de gens de letters or EncyclopÃ©die. The EncyclopÃ©die , published in France between 1751 and 1772, consisted of 28 volumes, which contained over 70,000 articles and 3,000 illustrations produced by more than 140 authors. These authors, included notable Enlightenment thinkers, reputable scholars and scientists, all experts in their field, and skilled tradesmen, describing in intricate detail the processes and tools of their craft. Denis Diderot (1713-1784), philosopher and writer, and Jean le Rond dâAlembert (1717-1783), mathematician, and physicist, edited and supervised the publication of the EncyclopÃ©die. It allowed both the Enlightenment philosophes the freedom to express their ideas on the most important political, social, technological developments of the time and allowed any reader of any class, faith, gender, wealth, etc. the opportunity to obtain, read and analyze for themselves the validity of the Enlightenment ideals. It also meant that the common people had access to knowledge usually reserved for the upper classes and that they had the ability to expand their knowledge and participate in a part of society that again, was usually reserved for the upper classes.

The general rule is that flags will be flown at half-staff on Memorial Day (until noon, when it should be raised to the Âtop of the staffÂ), and on Peace Officers Memorial Day. The Statute (4 U.S.C. 7(m)) sets forth the requirement that the flag will be flown at half-staff on the following occasions: 30 days from the death of the President or a former President; 10 days from the day of death of the Vice President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the Governor of a State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress. The President of the United States may order the honor: upon the death of Âprincipal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memoryÂ; In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. STATE GOVERNORS also have authority under the United States Code: ÂIn the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any State . . . the Governor of that State . . .may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at half-staff.Â http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/4/7.html The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position.

1C2-E-0002	OUT	After a year as a session drummer, Gaye ranked as the label's top-selling solo artist during the sixties. Due to solo hits including "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)", "Ain't That Peculiar", "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" and his duet singles with singers such as Mary Wells and Tammi Terrell, he was crowned "The Prince of Motown" and "The Prince of Soul". Notable for fighting the hit-making but restrictive Motown process in which performers and songwriters and producers were kept separate, Gaye proved with albums like his 1971 What's Going On and his 1973 Let's Get It On that he was able to produce music without relying on the system, inspiring fellow Motown artists such as Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson to do the same. His mid-1970s work including the Let's Get It On and I Want You albums helped influence the quiet storm, urban adult contemporary and slow jam genres.

The most secret operation of the Kennedy years, the CIA side of the operation was code-named AMWORLD, a term withheld from five Congressional investigations (and the Warren Commission) and declassified only in the 1990s. It appeared in print for the first time just three months ago. Using declassified files from the National Archives, we found that in the days, weeks, and months before Dallas, Robert Kennedy had a secret government committee looking at how the US could deal with the "assassination of American officials" if Castro found out about the Kennedys' coup plan, and tried to retaliate.

Department of Public Health), Romney backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned same-sex marriage but still allow civil unions, viewing it as the only feasible way to ban same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. In May 2004 Romney instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, no marriage licenses were to be issued to out-of-state same-sex couples not planning to move to Massachusetts.

The surrounding giant trees play an important cultural role in the Ewok religion; the Ewoks are a deeply spiritual race who believe themselves to be descendants of the Great Tree, a sacred tree in the forests. Ewoks also get their medicine from a single tree deep in the forests of Endor's moon. The tree excretes a substance in which the Ewoks call "Chak". They use it to heal their ills. .

1C2-E-0144	OUT	In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires high temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cycles.[ citation needed ] Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large â up to 96% has been demonstrated. In 2010, the United States led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,086 MW of installed capacity from 77 power plants; [3] the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at The Geysers , a geothermal field in California . Dry steam plants - use steam piped directly from a geothermal reservoir to turn the generator turbines. The first geothermal power plant was built in 1904 in Tuscany, Italy at a place where natural steam was erupting from the earth. Geothermal energy has three main uses: Heating, Electricity generation and Geothermal heat pumps.

Because the standard way to express interest rates is with the annual interest rate, the amount of interest which one earns with compounding is quantified as the Effective Annual Yield, which is the simple interest rate which produces the same yield for a one year period. This is computed as (1 + r/m)^m - 1. For example, 5% interest with quarterly compounding has an effective annual yield of (1 + .05/4)^4 - 1 = .0509 or 5.09%. 18% compounded monthly has an effective annual yield of (1 + .18/12)^12 - 1 = .1956 = 19.56%. For example, 12% annual nominal interest compounded monthly has a periodic (monthly) rate of 1%.Â  Effective annual rate: the nominal annual rate "adjusted" to allow comparisons; the nominal rate is restated to reflect the effective rate as if annual compounding were applied.

However, when new varieties were introduced by agronomists to native growers in the high plateau, the native growers rejected the new varieties, despite their 'magnificent' yields.

1C2-E-0167	OUT	The Central Artery/Tunnel Project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority with design and construction supervised by a joint venture of Bechtel Corporation and Parsons Brinckerhoff . Due to the enormous size of the projectâtoo large for any company to undertake aloneâthe design and construction of the Big Dig were broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included Jay Cashman , Modern Continental , Obayashi Corporation , Perini Corporation , Peter Kiewit Sons' , J.F. White , and the Slattery division of Skanska USA.

Any participating network device including routers, computers, time-servers, printers, Internet fax machines, and some telephones must have its own unique address. An IP address can appear to be shared by multiple client devices either because they are part of a shared hosting web server environment or because a proxy server (e.g. an ISP or anonymizer service) acts as an intermediary agent on behalf of its customers, in which case the real originating IP addresses might be hidden from the server receiving a request.

1C2-E-0178	OUT	Because that occurs much more often for blue light than for red, the sky appears blue. Violet light is actually scattered even a bit more strongly than blue. More of the sunlight entering the atmosphere is blue than violet, however, and our eyes are somewhat more sensitive to blue light than to violet light, so the sky appears blue. When light beams interact with particles suspended in air, the energy can be scattered or absorbed. Energy that is scattered causes a change in direction of the light path. The amount of light that is being scattered is a function of the size of the particle relative to the wavelength of the light falling on the particle. Particles that are tiny compared to the wavelength of the light scatter selectively according to wavelength. While all colors are scattered by air molecules, violet and blue are scattered most. The sky looks blue, not violet, because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light (the sun also emits more energy as blue light than as violet).

1C2-E-0180	OUT	One or several of these may, or may not, be the reason for making the sound; it is well-established that a cat will also purr when it is uneasy, nervous or in great pain , perhaps to comfort itself. Purring may also reduce pain, help a wounded cat to heal, and even help to keep a cat's bones strong. Cats purr at 27 - 44 hertz , and exposure to similar sound frequencies is known to improve bone density in humans. Purring has also been proven to have positive effects on cell regeneration . Since during these periods musculo-skeletal systems do not experience the normal stresses of physical activity, including routine standing or sitting, which requires strength for posture control, exposing these astronauts to sound frequencies similar to those of a cat's purr could counteract the deteriorating effects of zero-gravity.

1C2-E-0182	OUT	Scientists do not purport to know all of the biological mechanisms of the yawn, but tend to agree that a yawn is an involuntary respiratory reflex, which regulates the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the blood. Technically, a yawn is the reflex opening of the mouth followed by the deep inhalation and slow exhalation of oxygen. The very act of yawning is but one of a number of involuntary reflexes controlled by the spinal and nerve centers. Scientists speculate that the onset of a yawn is triggered either by fatigue, or by sheer boredom as, at those times, breathing is shallow, and little oxygen is carried to the lungs by the oxygen-toting cardiovascular system. When one yawns, his or her alertness is heightened, as the sudden intake of oxygen increases the heart rate, rids the lungs and the bloodstream of the carbon dioxide buildup, and forces oxygen through blood vessels in the brain, while restoring normal breathing and ventilating the lungs.

1C2-E-0184	OUT	These ions are carried away in runoff to streams and rivers and, ultimately, to the ocean. Many of the dissolved ions are used by organisms in the ocean and are removed from the water. Others are not used up and are left for long periods of time where their concentrations increase over time. The rain that falls on the land contains some dissolved carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic due to carbonic acid (which forms from carbon dioxide and water). In other words, about 35 of 1,000 (3.5%) of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts; in a cubic mile of seawater the weight of the salt, as sodium chloride, would be about 120 million tons. The USGS goes on to explain that, "By some estimates, if the salt in the ocean could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet (166 m) thick, about the height of a 40-story office building."

1C2-E-0185	OUT	"George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms." A Bloody Mary is a drink made from vodka and tomato juice, and often contains Tabasco sauce or other spices. The term "Bloody" refers to the bright red color of the drink. The term " Mary " may refer to a specific person named Mary -- one legend says that a man suggested the name because the drink made him think of a club named the "Bucket of Blood" and of a girl who went there named Mary .

1C2-E-0186	OUT	Anteaters are any of the three genera of mammals under order Edentata.Â  They are mostly found in Central America.Â  Most common species include the giant anteater and the pygmy anteater.Â  The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is the largest, weighing 23 kilograms.Â  The pygmy anteater (Cyclopes didatylus), on the other hand, is the smallest (about the size of a cat).Â  Anteaters usually inhabit tropical forests, feeding mainly on ants, termites, and other small insects.Â  An elongated skull with short ears, a tapered snout, and a tubular mouth with no teeth characterize them.Â  A long tongue covered with a sticky salivary secretion helps them gather food.Â  Their poor sight and hearing are compensated by their exceptional sense of smell.Â  Because of their low reproductive rate, overhunting drove anteaters into the list of endangered species. It is generally acknowledged that giant anteaters have a poor sense of sight but a keen sense of smell.

Â  Chlorophyll gives the leaves their green color.Â  Also in the leaves are other chemicals with yellow and orange colorsÂthe same chemicals that give color to some flowers, carrots, and even bananas.Â  You donÂt see those colors in summer because there is so much green chlorophyll in the leaves hiding the other colors.Â

1C2-E-0190	OUT	Spring Tides The Sun's Interaction with the Tides Spring tides are especially strong tides (they do not have anything to do with the season Spring). They occur when the Earth, the Sun , and the Moon are in a line. The gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun both contribute to the tides. Spring tides occur during the full moon and the new moon. When the Earth, moon, and sun are in line (sunâEarthâmoon, or sunâmoonâEarth) the two main influences combine to produce spring tides; when the two forces are opposing each other as when the angle moonâEarthâsun is close to ninety degrees, neap tides result. The Proxigean Spring Tide is a rare, unusually high tide. This very high tide occurs when the moon is both unusually close to the Earth (at its closest perigee , called the proxigee ) and in the New Moon phase (when the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth). The proxigean spring tide occurs at most once every 1.5 years .
