1C2-E-0002	OUT	Gaye had three children. His eldest child, Marvin P. Gaye III (c. 1965) was the result of a non-sexual arrangement concocted by the Gordy family with Denise Gordy , Anna's niece. In his Marvin Gaye biography, Trouble Man: The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye, Steve Turner quoted a Gordy relative in stating that Denise Gordy was the only female Gordy member to successfully produce children at the time and was willing to help her aunt. Gaye talked of the struggle to produce a child with Anna to David Ritz in Divided Soul and confirmed that Marvin III was adopted by Anna Gordy following his son's birth. Gaye had two children with Janis Hunter: daughter Nona (c. 1974) and son Frank (c. 1975). Both Marvin III and Nona pursued entertainment careers in their adulthoods. In addition, Marvin is the grandfather of three boys including Marvin IV (born April 1, 1995) and Nolan Pentz (c. 1996). Overtime, Marvin's music especially after What's Going On influenced certain forms of modern day pop music while playing an important role in developing other genres at the time. His recordings of "Inner City Blues", "Let's Get It On" and "Got to Give It Up" influenced the success of funk music, while the overall sound of his albums, Let's Get It On and I Want You paved the way for the later-established quiet storm genre alongside recordings by Barry White , The Isley Brothers and Smokey Robinson . His 1977 single "Got to Give It Up" influenced the sound of Michael Jackson as he developed his own sound through that recording on songs such as " Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground) " and " Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough ". The concept of Here, My Dear would influence later similar albums including Usher 's Raymond v. Raymond . The music of Gaye's 1972 soundtrack to Trouble Man influenced early hip-hop with several hip-hop musicians later sampling bits from the tracks for their own songs,

1C2-E-0025	OUT	In general, however, Method acting combines the actor's careful consideration of the character's psychological motives and personal identification with the character, possibly including a reproduction of the character's emotional state by recalling emotions or sensations from the actor's own life. In this sense, according to Marlon Brando, the actor does not so much become someone else as he becomes himself. It is often contrasted with acting in which thoughts and emotions are indicated, or presented in a clichéd, unrealistic way. Among the concepts and techniques of Method acting are substitution , "as if," sense memory, affective or emotional memory , animal work, and archetype work. Strasberg uses the question, "What would motivate me, the actor, to behave in the way the character does?" Strasberg asks the actor to replace the play's circumstances with his/her own, the substitution. Sanford Meisner , another Group Theatre pioneer, championed a closely related version of the Method,

1C2-E-0042	OUT	The administration of President Kennedy had backed U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world in the frame of the Cold War. While Robert Kennedy vigorously supported President Kennedy's earlier efforts, like his brother he never publicly advocated commitment of ground troops. Senator Kennedy had cautioned President Johnson against commitment of U.S. ground troops as early as 1965, but Lyndon Johnson chose to commit ground troops on recommendation of the rest of President Kennedy's still intact staff of advisers. Robert Kennedy did not strongly advocate withdrawal from Vietnam until 1967, within a week of Martin Luther King taking the same public stand. Consistent with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress , Robert Kennedy placed increasing emphasis on human rights as a central focus of U.S. foreign policy. John F. Kennedy's choice of Robert Kennedy as Attorney General following his election victory in 1960 was controversial, with The New York Times and The New Republic calling him inexperienced and unqualified. He had no experience in any state or federal court, causing the President to joke, "I can't see that it's wrong to give him a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law." There was precedent, however, in an Attorney General being appointed because of his role as a close adviser to the President, and Kennedy had significant experience in handling organized crime. After performing well in the Senate hearing he easily won confirmation in January 1961. To compensate for his deficiencies Kennedy chose an "outstanding" group of deputy and assistant attorneys general, including Byron White and Nicholas Katzenbach .

The bill also establishes means-tested state subsidies for people who do not have adequate employer insurance and whose income is below a threshold, with funds that were previously used to compensate for the health costs of the uninsured. He vetoed eight sections of the health care legislation, including a controversial $295-per-employee assessment on businesses that do not offer health insurance and provisions guaranteeing dental benefits to Medicaid recipients. The legislature overrode all eight vetoes, but the governor's office said the differences were not essential. The law was the first of its kind in the nation and becam

On 16 March, a 6-point peace plan was submitted to the UN. On 24 March 2012, Kofi Annan flew to Moscow in an effort to secure strong Russian support for his efforts to bring about a cease-fire and open political dialogue. On 27 March, the envoy's office said that the Syrian government had accepted the peace proposal, and would be working to implement it. On 4 April, Annan told the U.N. Security Council that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had given assurances he would “immediately” start pulling back his forces and complete a military withdrawal from urban areas by 10 April. Annan also said that if the cease-fire was successful, an unarmed U.N. monitoring mission of some 200 to 250 observers could be brought into Syria to monitor compliance to its terms.

1C2-E-0058	OUT	Who Shot JFK? : A Guide to the Major Conspiracy Theories (1993) by Bob Callahan and Mark Zingarelli explores some of the more obscure theories regarding JFK's murder, such as "The Coca-Cola Theory." According this theory, suggested by the editor of an organic gardening magazine, Oswald killed JFK due to mental impairment stemming from an addiction to refined sugar, as evidenced by his need for his favorite beverage immediately after the assassination. ISBN 0-671-79494-9 . David Lifton presented a scenario in which conspirators on Air Force One removed Kennedy's body from its original bronze casket and placed it in a shipping casket, while en route from Dallas to Washington. Once the presidential plane arrived at Andrews Air Force Base , the shipping casket with the President's body in it was surreptitiously taken by helicopter from the side of the plane that was out of the television camera's view. Kennedy's body was then taken to an unknown location—most likely Walter Reed Army Medical Center —to surgically alter the body to make it appear that he was shot only from the rear. Part of Lifton's theory comes from a House Select Committee on Assassinations report of an interview of Lt. Richard Lipsey on January 18, 1978 by committee staff members Donald Purdy and Mark Flanagan. According to the report, Richard Lipsey said that he and General Wehle had met President Kennedy's body at Andrews Air Force Base. Lipsey "...placed in a hearse to be transported to

As First Lady of Arkansas, Hillary Clinton was named chair of the Arkansas Educational Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system. In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association , to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.

After a 1–4 start and some poor performances, Orton was replaced by Tebow at halftime during a home game against the San Diego Chargers in the fifth week of the season. Tebow nearly led the Broncos back from a 16-point deficit, as he passed and ran for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. The Chargers ultimately won the game, 29–24. Shortly afterward, Broncos' head coach John Fox announced Tebow would start in the following game on the road against the Miami Dolphins . Tebow and the Broncos struggled in the first three-and-a-half quarters against the Dolphins, but rallied from a 15–0 deficit in the last three minutes to win the game, 18–15, in overtime.

1C2-E-0070	OUT	During the off-season, then-manager Bob Melvin 's contract was not extended and the Mariners brought in Mike Hargrove as the new manager with a contract through 2007. Ironically, it was Hargrove who predicted that Ichiro would be no better than "a fourth outfielder on major league team" back when Ichiro was still in Japan. Speculation started that Hargrove and Ichiro did not get along very well in the season. In 2005, Ichiro had his second worst year in his MLB career to date, collecting only 206 hits (the lowest total of his career). However, he reached the plateau of a .300 batting average, 100+ runs, 30+ steals and 200+ hits for the fifth straight season. That allowed Ichiro to become the first player to collect 200 hits per season in each of his first five years in the Major Leagues.

Cannavaro sustained the knock following a tackle by fellow defender Giorgio Chiellini and was carried off the field on a stretcher. Italy doctor Paolo Zeppilli said, "We have to do tests but it does not look like a minor injury." Tests had shown that he tore ligaments in his left ankle. Right after the examinations, Italian journalists awaited Cannavaro, who told them, "I'm going home," with a melancholic smile on his face. After the day was over, Roberto Donadoni called up Fiorentina centre-back Alessandro Gamberini as his official replacement. Alessandro Del Piero captained the team in his place. Cannavaro added he will stay with the squad to offer support. This would have been Cannavaro's third Euro tournament. At the 2002 World Cup , he was credited with holding the defence together, almost single-handedly after Alessandro Nesta was injured against Croatia . The injury, along with several mistakes from match officials, dealt a severe blow to Italy's chances of winning the World Cup, as the side relied heavily on the Cannavaro-Nesta partnership in central defence. Marco Materazzi , who deputized for Nesta, proved to be an ill-fated choice with his nervous performances. Italy went out in the second round, losing to co-hosts and eventual semi-finalists South Korea , again to a golden goal. Cannavaro had a hard act to follow when he took over as captain from Maldini after the 2002 World Cup, but he quickly won the team over with his constant smile, laid-back Neapolitan approach and inspiring performances. After Maldini's international retirement, he first captained Italy in a match in Naples and received a standing ovation on the pitch where he sported the local side's colours between 1991 and 1

Parker's first experiences were daunting as coach Gregg Popovich had him play against Spurs scout and ex-NBA player Lance Blanks . Parker was so overwhelmed by Blank's tough and physical defense that Popovich was ready to send him away after just 10 minutes. But after seeing a "best of" mix tape of Parker's best plays, Popovich decided to invite Parker a second time. This time, Parker made a better impression against Blanks; the Frenchman later described Blanks as a "one-man wrecking crew". But while Popovich decided that Parker was worth the gamble, the Spurs still had to hope that other teams would not pick Parker during the draft.

The suits alleged that salaried managers who worked between 40 and 50 hours per week, were improperly compensated for that time. The variable rate overtime ended in the first quarter of 2006. Lowe's has won eight consecutive ENERGY STAR awards (2003–2010), including four ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency. On March 1, 2010 Lowe's also became the first winner of the ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award in Retail. The award recognizes Lowe's long-standing leadership as a retailer of energy-efficient products. Lowe’s was awarded for its outstanding contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through promoting energy-efficient products and educating consumers and employees on the value of the Energy Star program. In 2000, Lowe’s released a policy promising that all wood products sold would not be sourced from rainforests. "Our new environmental policy represents a major victory for the forests and our customers," said Bob Tillman, Chairman and CEO of Lowe's. "Our customers expect Lowe's to deliver the best quality lumber and wood products that have been responsibly harvested and produced by our supplier

1C2-E-0112	OUT	Founder Andrew Wilson was inspired by the famous duck tours of Wisconsin Dells, WI. The company started running tours in Boston with four Ducks and now runs a fleet of 28. The first departure location was on Long Wharf in front of the New England Aquarium. In 1997 the Boston Duck Tours operation was moved to the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston at the Prudential Center. In 2002, Boston Duck Tours opened a second departure and ticketing location at the Museum of Science. In 2009, Boston Duck Tours opened a third departure and ticketing location at the New England Aquarium. Each year, Boston Duck Tours carries approximately 600,000 passengers. In 2002, the Boston Duck Tour Ducks were first used as the parade vehicles for the New England Patriots after the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI over the St. Louis Rams . Since that time, the Boston Duck Tour Ducks have participated in seven professional sports championship parades in Boston. There have been three for New England Patriots (2002, 2004, 2005), two for the Boston Red Sox (2004, 2007), one for the Boston Celtics (2008), and one for the Boston Bruins (2011). In 2010, Boston Duck Tours was asked to help transport flood victims in Wayland , MA. Torrential rains had left Pelham Island area of Wayland isolated and the Ducks were brought in to ferry people in and out of their neighborhood until the waters receded.

In 2000, San Francisco cartoonist Kieron Dwyer was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on the cover of one of his comics; later placing it on coffee mugs, t-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to free speech under U.S. law. The case was eventually settled out of court , as Dwyer claimed he did not have the financial ability to endure a trial case with Starbucks. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially "profiting" from using a "confusingly similar" image of the Starbucks siren logo.

Portions of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts. A 400 km (250 mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 m (2.0 ft), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land. One early estimate suggested that the Pacific plate may have moved westward by up to 20 m (66 ft), and another early estimate put the amount of slippage at as much as 40 m (130 ft). On 6 April the Japanese coast guard said that the quake shifted the seabed near the epicenter 24 meters (79 ft) and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi prefecture by 3 meters.

Alcuni storici, tuttavia, hanno sostenuto che, al di là dell'elemento sportivo, molti aficionados del FC Barcelona simpatizzano per questo club perché vi vedono una sorta di alternativa al "centralismo politico" con cui è identificato il Real Madrid, la squadra della capitale , specialmente dagli anni della dittatura franchista. Proprio in quegli anni fu coniata la frase «més que un club» («più di un club»), che sarebbe diventata il motto più conosciuto del FC Barcelona. Attualmente il Barcellona è uno dei quattro club spagnoli (assieme a Real Madrid , Athletic Bilbao e Osasuna ) a non essere una Sociedad Anónima Deportiva ma a essere gestito direttamente dai soci, in una forma di azionariato popolare . Il Barcellona riunisce soci e appassionati di qualsiasi ideologia politica, credenza religiosa e provenienza geografica. Ciò nonostante, secondo la maggior parte degli storici e dei sociologi, nell'aderire al Barça la grande massa sociale del club non ha obbedito a motivi di natura esclusivamente sportiva, ma soprattutto al carattere rappresentativo che, per molti appassionati, il club possiede su un piano sociale e politico. Il FC Barcelona, reputato l'entità sociale più conosciuta della Catalogna, ha esercitato, nel corso della propria storia, una funzione rappresentativa di difesa dei valori catalani , che il club ha preservato pubblicamente in numerose occasioni, come osserva il giornalista inglese Jimmy Burns nel suo libro Barça, la pasión de un pu

1C2-E-0131	OUT	A more recent third type of sports camp that has been gaining popularity involves bringing professional coaches and trainers to the athletes instead of the athletes traveling to overnight camps. These camps are more tailored to youth sports teams because they present an effective solution for school and club teams to receive excellent training on their own schedule at much less of a cost. There is no need to pay travel or room and board for any of the campers so the costs are often 1/4 to 1/3 of the price of an average overnight sports camp for a similar level of training. The campers stay at home and attend the camp training at their school or club. Live 2 Compete is one of the camps pioneering this type of camp experience by providing single-sport focused take home camp experiences for high school sports teams. Many sports camps are of the second type, which focuses almost exclusively on one particular sport. These camps generally focus on helping each camper acquire skills in a sport that help them gain confidence and improve their chances of making the team when they return to school. Indeed, some campers are helped to be nationally competitive by way of this kind of intensive summer training. These camps generally run week-long sessions, and some campers may attend more than one session even though the curriculum repeats each week. Some single-sport camps offer longer sessions. Many of the instructors at these camps are coaches of local teams, and thus many athletes get valuable extra time with the coach they play for during the school year (or the coach they hope to play for during the upcoming school year).

A nearby army barracks was instantly destroyed, killing all 500 soldiers. Windows were shattered for miles. More than 1,000 people were killed and several thousand injured. In the year 1971 Santiago de Cali hosted the Pan American Games , an event which is considered by many as the height of the city's golden age as a model of civic orderliness: after it Cali was named the Sports Capital of Colombia . In 1982, the government of Cali inaugurated what is now the third largest building in the Republic of Colombia . "La Torre de Cali", or The Cali Tower. It has a hotel, offices and apartment complexes. It stands at 42 floors above the city, making it the 3rd largest building in Colombia and the largest building in Cali. Cali is located on the Cauca Valley to the west of the Cauca River and to the east of the Western Mountain Range near the hills known as Farallones de Cali. The city rests approximately 1,000 meters (3,280 ft.) above sea level and its topography is fairly flat. Approximately 100 km west of Cali and over the Western Cordillera, lies the port city of Buenaventura on the Colombian Pacific coast; to the northeast are the industrial town of Yumbo and the city of Palmira, where Cali's international airport, the Alfonso Bonilla Aragón (CLO), is located in Palmira , Colombia.

When the Empire begins operations on the moon of Endor, prior to the events depicted in the film, it ignores the primitive Ewoks. Princess Leia Organa , part of a Rebel strike team, then befriends the Ewok Wicket W. Warrick , a scout from said village, and is taken to meet the other Ewoks. The rest of the strike team are accidentally trapped by Ewoks and brought to the village. George Lucas created the Ewoks because he wanted Return of the Jedi to feature a tribe of some primitive creatures that bring down the technological Empire. He had originally intended the scenes to be set on the Wookiee home planet , but as the film series evolved, the Wookiees became technologically skilled. Lucas designed a new species instead, and says his approach was simple: Wookiees are tall, so he made Ewoks short. The Ewok are named after the Miwok , a Native American tribe, indigenous to the Redwood forest in which the Endor scenes were filmed for Return of the Jedi, near the San Rafael location of Lucas' Skywalker Ranch . The name also is a pun on the syllables of Wookiee in reverse order. In the film, the name "Ewok" is never actually spoken, but it appears in both the script and the closing credits.

Low-temperature geothermal resources are typically used in direct-use applications, such as district heating, greenhouses, fisheries , mineral recovery, and industrial process heating. However, some low-temperature resources can generate electricity using binary cycle electricity generating technology. Approximately 70 countries made direct use of 270 petajoules (PJ) of geothermal heating in 2004. More than half went for space heating, and another third for heated pools. The remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications. Global installed capacity was 28 GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since heat is mostly needed in winter.

1C2-E-0145	OUT	It is sometimes mathematically simpler, e.g. in the valuation of derivatives to use continuous compounding, which is the limit as the compounding period approaches zero. Continuous compounding in pricing these instruments is a natural consequence of Itō calculus , where derivatives are valued at ever increasing frequency, until the limit is approached and the derivative is valued in continuous time. The effect of compounding depends on the frequency with which interest is compounded and the periodic interest rate which is applied. Therefore, in order to define accurately the amount to be paid under a legal contract with interest, the frequency of compounding (yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc.) and the interest rate must be specified. Different conventions may be used from country to country, but in finance and economics the following usages are common: = Number of compounding periods per year (note that the total number of compounding periods is To convert an interest rate from one compounding basis to another compounding basis, the following formula applies:

This bitterness has beneficial effects during cultivation, as the plant is unpopular with birds and thus requires minimal protection. There have been attempts to lower the saponin content of quinoa through selective breeding to produce sweeter, more palatable varieties that have proven difficult due to cross pollination contamination. The toxicity category rating of quinoa saponins are classified as a mild eye and respiratory irritant and a low gastrointestinal irritant. The saponin is a toxic glycoside , a main contributor to its hemolytic effects when combined directly with blood cells.

Sonotubes, the leading brand employed by Dobson, are less expensive than commercially available telescope tubes and are available in comparatively large sizes. Dobsonian scopes are intended to be transported out to dark sky locations, and Sonotubes are claimed to be more rugged than aluminum or fiberglass tubes which can dent or shatter from impacts. Sonotubes have the added advantage of being thermally stable and non-conductive which minimize unwanted convection currents in the light path caused by handling of the tube assembly. Digital setting circles: The invention of microprocessor based digital setting circles has allowed any altazimuth mounted telescope to be fitted or retrofitted with the ability to accurately display the coordinates of the telescope direction. These systems not only give the user a digital read-out for right ascension (RA) declination (dec.), they also interface with digital devices such as laptop computers, tablet computers , and smartphones using live ephemeris calculating / charting planetarium software to give a current graphical representation of where the telescope is pointing, allowing the user to quickly find an object.

1C2-E-0166	OUT	Rebar cages are fabricated either on or off the project site commonly with the help of hydraulic benders and shears, however for small or custom work a tool known as a Hickey - or hand rebar bender, is sufficient. The rebars are placed by rodbusters or concrete reinforcing ironworkers with bar supports separating the rebar from the concrete forms to establish concrete cover and ensure that proper embedment is achieved. The rebars in the cages are connected either by welding, tying steel wire, or with mechanical connections . For epoxy coated or galvanised rebars only the latter is possible. The structural performance criteria for mechanical connections varies considerably between different countries, codes, and industries. As a minimum requirement, codes typically specify that the rebar to splice connection meets or exceeds 125% of the specified tensile strength of the rebar. More stringent criteria also requires the development of the specified ultimate strength of the rebar. As an example, ACI 318 specifies either Type 1 (125% Fy) or Type 2 (125% Fy and 100% Fu) performance criteria. For concrete structures designed with ductility in mind, it is recommended that the mechanical connections are also capable of failing in a ductile manner, typically known in the reinforcing steel industry as achieving "bar-break". As an example, Caltrans specifies a required mode of failure (i.e., "necking of the bar"). Safety

1C2-E-0169	OUT	CSC is similar to CSR except that values are read first by column, a row index is stored for each value, and column pointers are stored. I.e. CSC is (val, row_ind, col_ptr), where val is an array of the (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right-bottom) non-zero values of the matrix; row_ind is the row indices corresponding to the values; and, col_ptr is the list of val indexes where each column starts. The name is based on the fact that column index information is compressed relative to the COO format. One typically uses another format (LIL, DOK, COO) for construction. This format is efficient for arithmetic operations, column slicing, and matrix-vector products. See scipy.sparse.csc_matrix . This is the traditional format for specifying a sparse matrix in MATLAB (via the sparse function). An important special type of sparse matrices is band matrix , defined as follows. The lower bandwidth of a matrix A is the smallest number p such that the entry aij vanishes whenever i > j + p. Similarly, the upper bandwidth is the smallest p such that aij = 0 whenever i < j − p ( Golub & Van Loan 1996 , §1.2.1). For example, a tridiagonal matrix has lower bandwidth 1 and upper bandwidth 1. As another example, the following sparse matrix has lower and upper bandwidth both equal to 3. Notice that zeros are represented with dots.

The three credit bureaus run Annualcreditreport.com , where users can get their free credit reports. Credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee. This fee is usually around $10, as the FTC regulates this charge, and the credit bureaus are not allowed to charge an exorbitant fee for their credit score.If the consumer disputes an item on a credit report obtained using the free system, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise. Alternatively, consumers wishing to obtain their credit scores can in some cases purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from Fair Isaac. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available for "free" through sub

1C2-E-0171	OUT	IP networks may be divided into subnetworks in both IPv4 and IPv6. For this purpose, an IP address is logically recognized as consisting of two parts: the network prefix and the host identifier, or interface identifier (IPv6). The subnet mask or the CIDR prefix determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts. Multiple client devices can appear to share IP addresses: either because they are part of a shared hosting web server environment or because an IPv4 network address translator (NAT) or proxy server acts as an intermediary agent on behalf of its customers, in which case the real originating IP addresses might be hidden from the server receiving a request . A common practice is to have a NAT hide a large number of IP addresses in a private network . Only the "outside" interface(s) of the NAT need to have Internet-routable addresses. Most commonly, the NAT device maps TCP or UDP port numbers on the outside to individual private addresses on the inside. Just as a telephone number may have site-specific extensions, the port numbers are site-specific extensions to an IP address.

1C2-E-0173	OUT	There are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of liquid crystal displays , electrochromic displays, and the electronic equivalent of an Etch A Sketch at Kyushu University. Advantages of electronic paper includes low power usage (power is only drawn when the display is updated), flexibility and better readability than most displays. Electronic ink can be printed on any surface, including walls, billboards, product labels and T-shirts. The ink's flexibility would also make it possible to develop rollable displays for electronic devices. Electronic ink can be applied to flexible or rigid materials. For flexible displays, the base requires a thin, flexible material tough enough to withstand considerable wear, such as extremely thin plastic. The method of how the inks are encapsulated and then applied to the substrate is what distinguishes each company from others. These processes are complex and are carefully guarded industry secrets. Nevertheless, making electronic paper promises to be less complex and costly than making traditional LCDs.

1C2-E-0178	OUT	The sunlit sky is blue because air scatters short- wavelength light more than longer wavelengths. Since blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The result is that the human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun. The color perceived is similar to that obtained by a monochromatic blue of wavelength 474–476 nm mixed with white light, i.e., an unsaturated blue light. Near sunrise and sunset , most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red. Therefore, when looking at the sunset and sunrise, you will see the color red more than any of the other colors. The Arago point, named after its discoverer, is customarily located at about 20° above the antisolar point ; but it lies at higher altitudes in turbid air. The latter property makes the Arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric turbidity .

1C2-E-0180	OUT	Cats often purr when being petted, becoming relaxed, or when eating. Female cats are known to sometimes purr while giving birth . Domestic cats have been reported to purr when injured, sick, in pain or dying. Purring may have developed as a signalling mechanism between mother cats and nursing kittens. One theory is that it is not a sign of showing relaxation or content, but an attempt at "friendship" or a signal of "specific intent". For example, when a cat is nervous and cannot escape the situation (at a veterinarian perhaps), its purr may serve as an attempt to avoid being hurt. German ethologist and cat behaviorist Paul Leyhausen interprets it as a signal that the animal is not posing a threat. Scientists at the University of Sussex showed in 2009 that purring, or some purring, seems to be a way for domesticated cats to signal their owners for food. According to Dr. Karen McComb and her team, purring in the "about to be fed" context has a high-frequency component not ordinarily pres

1C2-E-0181	OUT	A common assertion is that heavy consumption of turkey meat results in drowsiness , due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable to that contained in most other meats. Furthermore, post-meal drowsiness may have more to do with what else is consumed along with the turkey and, in particular, carbohydrates . It has been demonstrated in both animal models and humans that ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers release of insulin . Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan (an aromatic amino acid ) into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in the uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal flu

1C2-E-0182	OUT	One study states that yawning occurs when one's blood contains increased amounts of carbon dioxide and therefore becomes in need of the influx of oxygen (or expulsion of carbon dioxide) that a yawn can provide, but studies have since shown it to be either incorrect or, at the very best, flawed. Yawning may in fact reduce oxygen intake compared to normal respiration, not increase it. Another speculated reason for yawning is the desire to stretch one's muscles. Yawns are often accompanied by the urge to stretch. Prey animals must be ready to physically exert themselves at any given moment. There have been studies that suggest yawning, especially psychological "contagious" yawning, may have developed as a way of keeping a group of animals alert. If an animal is drowsy or bored, it may not be as alert as it should to be prepared to spring into action. Therefore, the "contagious" yawn could be an instinctual reaction to a signal from one member of the "herd" reminding the others to stay ale

1C2-E-0184	OUT	Although humans cannot survive on seawater, some people claim that up to two cups a day, mixed with fresh water in a 2:3 ratio, produces no ill effect. The French physician Alain Bombard survived an ocean crossing in a small Zodiak rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat, which contains about 40 percent water (like most living tissues), as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean. His findings were challenged, but an alternative explanation was not given. In Kon-Tiki , Thor Heyerdahl reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 40/60% ratio. A few years later another adventurer named William Willis claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply. Most modern ocean-going vessels desalinate potable water from seawater using processes such as vacuum distillation or multi-stage flash distillation in an evaporator , or more recently by reverse osmosis .

1C2-E-0186	OUT	In the mythology and folklore of the Amazon Basin , the giant anteater is depicted as a trickster foil to the jaguar . In one Shipib tale, the anteater challenged the jaguar to a breath holding contest underwater, which the jaguar accepted. After the two removed their pelt and submerged, the anteater jumped out of the water and stole the jaguar’s pelt, leaving the jaguar with the anteater’s pelt. The anteater was considered a humorous figure due to its long snout. One Yarabara myth tells of how an evil ogre named Ucara was punished by the sun, who transformed him into an anteater. The Kayapo people have masks of various animals and spirits, including those of the anteater, during naming and initiation ceremonies. It is believed that women who touched the anteater masks or men who stumbled while wearing them would receive death or mental illness. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas , the giant anteater was one of many animals taken to Europe for display. At first, Europeans

1C2-E-0188	OUT	Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather," or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. The difference between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get." Over historical time spans there are a number of nearly constant variables that determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics . Other climate determinan

1C2-E-0189	OUT	In April 2006, Steve Jobs announced to the city council of Cupertino that Apple had acquired nine contiguous properties to build a second campus in the city one mile east of the old campus. Apple has had a presence in Cupertino since one year after its founding in 1976, which is why the company decided to build in the area rather than move to a cheaper location. When completed it is expected that the centralized campus will house some 13,000 employees.The purchase of the property was done through the company Hines Interests who hid the name of Apple as a buyer to keep costs from skyrocketing.Among the sellers of the properties were listed Summerhill Homes (a plot of 8 acres (32,000 m2)) and Hewlett-Packard (three abandoned buildings of their campus in Cupertino, among others). The land cost was estimated at USD $160 million. The new campus design will take 3 to 4 years, and the project cost is estimated at USD $500 million.

1C2-E-0190	OUT	In the 2nd century BC, the Babylonian astronomer , Seleucus of Seleucia , correctly described the phenomenon of tides in order to support his heliocentric theory. He correctly theorized that tides were caused by the moon , although he believed that the interaction was mediated by the pneuma . He noted that tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to link tides to the lunar attraction, and that the height of the tides depends on the moon's position relative to the sun. In China, Wang Chong (27–100 AD) correlated tide to the moon's movement in the book entitled Lunheng . He noted that "tide's rise and fall follow the moon and vary in magnitude." The Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder collates many tidal observations, e.g., the spring tides are a few days after (or before) new and full moon and are highest around the equinoxes, though Pliny noted many relationships now regarded as fanciful.

1C2-E-0191	OUT	For the secondary to be imploded by the hot, radiation-induced plasma surrounding it, it must remain cool for the first microsecond, i.e., it must be encased in a massive radiation (heat) shield. The shield's massiveness allows it to double as a tamper, adding momentum and duration to the implosion. No material is better suited for both of these jobs than ordinary, cheap uranium-238, which also happens to undergo fission when struck by the neutrons produced by D-T fusion. This casing, called the pusher, thus has three jobs: to keep the secondary cool, to hold it, inertially, in a highly compressed state, and, finally, to serve as the chief energy source for the entire bomb. The consumable pusher makes the bomb more a uranium fission bomb than a hydrogen fusion bomb. It is noteworthy that insiders never used the term hydrogen bomb. Finally, the heat for fusion ignition comes not from the primary but from a second fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded in the heart of the secondary

1C2-E-0202	OUT	Some believe that removing the United Kingdom's ability to set its own interest rates would have detrimental effects on its economy. One argument is that currency flexibility is a vital tool and that the sharp devaluation of sterling in 2008 was just what Britain needed to rebalance its economy. Another objection is that many continental European governments have large unfunded pension liabilities. They fear that if Britain adopts the euro, these liabilities could put a debt burden on the British taxpayer, though others have dismissed this argument as spurious. Some argue that as intra-European exports are 60% of the UK's total exports, a single currency would enhance the Internal Market by reducing the cost of exchanging currency for businesses and travellers, and reducing currency risk . An interesting parallel can be seen in the 19th century discussions concerning the possibility of the UK joining the Latin Monetary Union . The entry of the UK into the Eurozone would likely have a p

1C2-E-0203	OUT	A ' trash can ' metaphor is sometimes used for a place in a computer which stores a collection of deleted files. This location is called ‘Trash’ on a Macintosh , Be and other systems, or ‘Recycle Bin’ on Microsoft Windows . Formerly known as ‘Trash’ and ‘Wastebasket’ on international English Macs and GNOME desktop environments, it is now simply called “Deleted Items” in GNOME. The ‘trash can’ icon remains intact, however. The design objectives behind the bin were efficient use of space and safety: to provide at least as much space as the older round bins, whilst reducing the risk of injury caused by moving it. This is important for both the householder and the waste collector , who risked injury through lifting the traditional bin or from sharp, or possibly contaminated objects in garbage bags . Standardisation of dimensions is important because the bins must be lifted by a standard sized hoist on the dustcart. The bins are lifted by the lip at the front which must be designed for maximum stiffness and mechanical strength . The underside of the lip is therefore reinforced by numerous ribs in the case of the thermoplastic bins. Steel bins have a much simpler lip owing to the properties of steel.
