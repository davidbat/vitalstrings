### TITLE
	INFORMATION retrieval
	(+Retrieving what doesn't exist yet)
				draft v2 written by Tetsuya Sakai

### DESCRIPTION

Go beyond DOCUMENT relevance and DOCUMENT retrieval.
Provide the user with the INFORMATION he wants.

### Why

Many information needs are not about finding a set of DOCUMENTS
or about scanning a ranked list of snippets.
The user wants the INFORMATION.
The INFORMATION may be scattered across documents;
it may lie implicitly across them.

Why are we (including search engine companies) still
evaluating ranked lists of documents using nDCG etc?
Time to move forward!

### What

- Systematiclly define the basic INFORMATION UNIT (cf. DARPA GALE nugget).
NOTE: there may be language dependent issues here.
- Build a theory for relevant INFO UNIT retrieval
(as opposed to document="bag of words" retrieval).
- Establish an evaluation framework based on INFO UNITs
that takes care of redundancy/novelty, diversity, *dependency, information
discovery through inference.

*Dependency example: 
an info unit may or may not be relevant depending on whether another nugget
exists in a nearby context.

### Scientific and engineering and ... challenges

- Right answers or info units differ across users and contexts (e.g. background, current context).
How to select the right ones?
- How to handle info unit dependency in building systems and in evaluation?
- Right answers change (dynamicity). How do we maintain truth for evaluation?
- How can the system maintain the reliability of synthesized information AND convince the user?
- Synthesize and infer information from multiple languages

### Sizzle

A busy mobile user enters a query. System outputs
a concise multi-document summary that fits his mobile screen.
User immediately gets the INFORMATION she wants.

### Obstacles

- Info unit is always difficult to define.
- Info unit dependency is at least as difficult to handle as term dependency.
- Info unit based evaluation results may not agree with readability and trustworthiness.
- Manually building right answers for things that don't yet exist is difficult and expensive.
