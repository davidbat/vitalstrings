          CALL FOR TASK PARTICIPATION
            NTCIR-10 1CLICK-2 Task:
   One Click Access for English and Japanese

http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/tesakai/1click2.aspx

Test queries released: Aug 2012 
Evaluation results released: Feb 2013
Final NTCIR-10 workshop: June 18-21 2013

### OVERVIEW ###

Unlike traditional search engines
that return a ranked list of web pages,
One Click Access systems 
return a short multi-document summary of webpages
and aim to satisfy the user immediately after
a click on the SEARCH button.
Systems must aim to return important pieces of information and
to minimise the amount of text the user has to read.
These requirements are particularly important in mobile environments.

1CLICK-1 at NTCIR-9 only considered a Japanese task,
but for this second round (1CLICK-2),
we are expanding our scope to English.
Moreover, while 1CLICK-1 considered only four query
types (CELEBRITY, LOCAL, DEFINITION and QA),
1CLICK-2 will use a more fine-grained taxonomy
comprising eight query types.

Evaluation will be based on
"information units" (iUnits),
also often referred to as "nuggets".
As in 1CLICK-1, we will use S-measure from
Sakai/Kato/Song CIKM'11
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/tesakai/cikmfp0040-sakai.pdf
and will also consider developing new evaluation methods based on
Pavlu et al. WSDM'12

### TASKS ###

Japanese Main Task

 Given a Japanese query, return an X-character string
 that contain important information (X=500,140).
 This is basically the same as the 1CLICK-1 task.

English Main Task

 Similar to the Japanese Main Task except that
 query and the output are in English.
 
Query Classification Subtask (for Japanese and English)

 Given a query, classify it into one of the eight known query types.


In addition to queries, the organisers will provide
query suggestion data and baseline web search results
to enhance repeatability and fairness, and to
encourage newcomers to participate.
