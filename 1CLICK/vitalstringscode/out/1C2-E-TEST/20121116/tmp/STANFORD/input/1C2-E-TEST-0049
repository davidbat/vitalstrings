COLUMBIA, SCÃÂ Ã¢â¬â 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul received today the key endorsement of tea party favorite and South Carolina political heavyweight, state Sen. Tom Davis (R-Beaufort).

Paul's son, Rand, is a Tea Party favorite in his race for Senate in Kentucky -- he was recently endorsed by Sarah Palin , who was the keynote speaker at the Tea Party Convention in Nashville earlier this month.Â .

He and Wall, who helped organize a local tax day Tea Party rally last April, said the claim that Paul inspired the Tea Party movement is false.Â .

Though Ron Paul may be the model of the grassroots-backed conservative candidate that Tea Party groups are looking for, the candidates challenging him in the Republican primary this year say the good doctor brought it on himself -- by spending too much time running for president and not enough time tending to his district, and being so prickly with congressional colleagues as to render himself obsolete.

If Cruz manages a run-off, the Tea Party movement in Texas and Indiana may be prologue to a wider story of Tea Party insurgency in election 2012.

Neo-Nazis speak openly about their involvement and support for the Tea Party movement on the White Supremacist Site, Stormfront.

The Tea Party, which started off as a Libertarian protest against taxes and government, has turned into a right wing, corporate sponsored, racist hate-fest.

The same people behind the Bush administration have decided to use the Tea Party movement to put the Republicans back in power.

Rand Paul indicated today that he believes it would be bad for the Tea Party if his father, Ron Paul, decides to run as a third-party presidential candidate.

But the younger Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky, declined to say if he would support his father if Ron Paul does end up running on a third-party ticket.

Asked if he would support his father as a third-party candidate, Paul replied:ÃÂ "I've always said I think the Tea Party movement is best and most effective within the Republican party.

The Tea Party movement as a separate movement would divide some of the Republican vote."ÃÂ .

"I have not been publicly in favor of a third party candidate and I have not been in favor of the Tea Party splitting off," Paul said.

In an election year without the Tea Party movement, Rand Paulâs campaign to become Kentuckyâs next U.S. senator would be just as quixotic as the bid his father, Ron Paul, made for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008.

Thereâs a battle brewing between the big-government establishment, sometimes called neoconservatives, and both the Ron Paul and Tea Party factions of the party.

The insurgency inside the GOP got a shot in the arm in 2010 with the election of Tea Party candidates such as Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and Utah Senator Mike Lee.

Kwiatkowski, on the other hand, has pledged to vote against all debt limit increases and to stand with both the Ron Paul movement and the Tea Party movement in seeking less spending and lower taxes.

Ron, Rand Paul hold joint tea party rally in Texas.

The national Tea Party Express is sponsoring the event which also features Ted Cruz.

Ron Paul supporters do not want to talk about the real Ron Paul and his entire record.

Ron Paul supporters have cried for the spotllight on their candidate. So far he has run from it.

On June 21, 2011, Paul was the first 2012 Republican presidential candidate to sign the Cut, Cap, and Balance Pledge.

Ron Paul support sign on day of the Michigan presidential primary, Ann Arbor.

Heavily speculated as a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election , Paul appeared in the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) straw poll .

On September 12, Paul attended the Tea Party Republican Presidential debate broadcasted by CNN.

On October 22, Paul won the Ohio Republican straw poll with the support of 53% of the participants, more than double the support of the second-place candidate, Herman Cain (26%).

The Tea Party movement is not a national political party; polls show that most Tea Partiers consider themselves to be Republicans [77] [78] and the movement's supporters have tended to endorse Republican candidates.

[148] The Wall Street JournalÃ¢â¬âNBC News poll in mid October showed 35% of likely voters were Tea-party supporters, and they favored the Republicans by 84% to 10%.

However the effectiveness of the Tea Party to endorse candidates has come into question as only 32% of the candidates that were backed by the Tea Party, or were on a ballot line with a "Tea Party" name, won the election [150].

[203] Later that month tea party candidate for Senate Ted Cruz got enough of the primary vote in Texas to force a run-off vote against establishment GOP candidate David Dewhurst .

Mostly, Tea Party organizations are said to have shifted away from national demonstrations to local issues.

In that poll, 42% said the Tea Party has been good for the U.S. political system; 18% called it a bad thing.

When asked if the Tea Party movement will help or hurt Republicans in the 2012 elections, 53% of Republicans said they see the Tea Party as a political plus.

In 2009, the major Tea Party protests were quoted twice as often as the National Equality March despite a much lower turnout.

In October 2010, a survey conducted by The Washington Post found that the majority of local Tea Party organizers consider the media coverage of their groups to be fair.

Like Brice, McAllister thinks leaders of the Tea Party movement must not ignore the issue.

[284] "I have been speaking to Tea Parties, Americans for Prosperity, since 2009, before it was cool," Cain said, and then, referring to his victories in recent Tea Party Straw polls, "...ÃÂ If the Tea Party organization is racist, why does the black guy keep winning all these straw polls?".

Leaders of the Tea Party movement tried to contain the damage by denouncing the violent acts.

The Tea Party Patriots have asked both Democrats and Republicans to sign on to the Contract.
