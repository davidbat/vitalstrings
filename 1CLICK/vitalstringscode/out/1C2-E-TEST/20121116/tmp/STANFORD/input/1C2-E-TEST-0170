However, having a collections account on your credit report hurts your credit and can stop any financing deals.

The information provided in the credit report also will allow businesses to verify that the identifying information provided in the credit application is truthful.

You sometimes can get a mortgage at a discounted rate if you obtain a private mortgage, but this arrangement rarely improves your credit score.

A higher score can qualify you for better rates on loans, credit cards and other credit-based products.

Your credit score is based upon the information contained within your credit report.

Generally, the less debt you owe, the higher your score will be, so paying off accounts may improve your credit.

The information in your report determines your FICO credit score, which runs from 300 to 850.

Having credit accounts and owing money on them does not mean the consumer is a high-risk borrower and gets a low score. However, owing a great deal of money on many accounts can indicate that a person is overextended, and is more likely to make some payments late or not at all.

In addition to the overall amount the consumer owes, the score considers the amount he/she may owe on specific types of accounts, such as credit cards and installment loans.

Sometimes financial planners recommend consolidating higher interest debt into a new lower interest account.

Length of credit history accounts for approximately 15% of the weight of the score.

New credit inquiries account for approximately 10% of the weight of the score.

Opening new accounts responsibly and paying them off on time will raise the score in the long term.

It is not necessary to have one of each, though Advantage Credit has found that a credit card account, a store or other revolving account and an installment loan (i.e. home or auto loan) provide good results over time.

Late payments will lower the score, but establishing or re-establishing a good track record of making payments on time will raise the score.

An overall good credit picture can outweigh one or two instances of late credit card payments, for example.

Late payments reported recently are more detrimental to the score than are late payments that were reported in the past.

A lousy credit score means you may not be approved for the loans and credit needed for such items, or if you are approved, you'll likely pay more money in interest to obtain that credit.

Payment History: Accounts for roughly 35% of your score. This one is pretty self-explanatory, paying your bills on time will help keep your scores high, while late payments, charge-offs, and collections will hurt.

Amounts Currently Owed: 30% of your score is based on the amount of debt you're currently carrying Ã¢â¬âor more specifically, the amount of money you currently owe your creditors. While this category looks at the total amount that you owe ( credit cards , home loans, car loans, etc.), it's the credit cards Ã¢â¬âor revolving accounts Ã¢â¬â that have the most impact on your credit score. In order to maximize your scores in this section, you should keep your balances in relation to your credit limits as low as possible.

Since its introduction 20 years ago, the FICOÃÂ® Score has become a global standard for measuring credit risk in the banking, mortgage, credit card, auto and retail industries.

Your credit report is a history of how you pay your bills.

It includes your credit accounts--mortgages, student loans, credit cards, and auto loans--and shows if you've been late or on time with your payments, the balances on these accounts, and who else has been looking at your credit report.

Your credit score is calculated from a formula based on the components of your credit report.

Even if you don't use a certain credit card anymore, if you have a history of paying that bill on time, keep it open.

Repairing those dings on your credit report before you need a new loan can help you avoid financial problems later.

Having a low credit score will affect your ability to obtain credit cards, car loans and home mortgages.

Your credit score is calculated based on your payment history for loans, credit cards and mortgages.

Collection accounts, bankruptcies and public records have the greatest negative impact on your score.

Refinancing occurs when you take out a larger loan over an extended period of time to pay off a smaller loan, and this may have an impact on your credit score.

Your credit score determines the interest rate you pay for loans and mortgages.

When your credit score is low, lenders might ask you to get a creditworthy co-signer for your loan.

As long as you use a new account responsibly, it will likely have a positive effect on your score eventually.

Poor credit can limit the amount of money you can borrow and determine the interest rate and terms of your loans.

Ironically, to build credit, you must apply for credit. Find a credit card that extends credit to borrowers with low or no credit score.

The score also reflects the risk a financial institution may take if it extends additional credit in the form of a loan, a line of credit or a revolving credit account.

Lenders and credit issuers check your credit before approving you for a loan or other credit products.

In addition, each report must contain at least one account that has been updated in the past six months.

Credit scores are three-digit "scores" that show how responsible you've been in paying off credit cards, mortgages, car loans, and other lines of credit. The three credit bureaus Ã¢â¬â TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian Ã¢â¬â use the information in your credit report to calculate your credit scores.

Your credit history Ã¢â¬â mortgages, auto loans, student loans, credit cards, and other lines of credit opened in your name, along with your history of payments (on-time, late, or missed).
