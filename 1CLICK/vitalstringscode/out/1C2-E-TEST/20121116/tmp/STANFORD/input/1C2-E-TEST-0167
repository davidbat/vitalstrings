Prior to construction of the Big Dig, the Central Artery carried not only north-south traffic, but much east-west traffic as well, a major cause of its all-day congestion.

The project was officially handed over to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority at the end of 2007.

Big Dig is the unofficial name of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T), a megaproject that rerouted the Central Artery (Interstate 93), the chief controlled-access highway through the heart of Boston, Massachusetts, into a 3.5 mile (5.6 km) tunnel under the city.

Initially, the plan was also to include a rail connection between BostonÃ¢â¬â¢s two major train terminals.

When construction began, the project cost, including the Charles River crossing, was estimated at $5.8 billion.

Eventual cost overruns were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, James Kerasiotes, was fired in 2000.

Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the North End and in the South Bay interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.

The Central Artery/Tunnel Project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority with design and construction supervised by a joint venture of Bechtel Corporation and Parsons Brinckerhoff.

A tunnel underneath Leverett Circle connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle.

Turnpike to Logan Airport, by connecting I-90 to the Ted Williams Tunnel. So you can now take I-90 all the way from Boston's Logan Airport, on the ocean, to Seattle Washington.

Boston's Central Artery-Tunnel project, as it is officially known, is supposed to bury underground a stretch of elevated highway that runs straight through the heart of the city.

In July 2006 part of the ceiling collapsed in a tunnel segment under South Boston, connecting I-90 to the Ted Williams Tunnel.

The Central Artery / Tunnel Project (CA/T), undertaken by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, commenced in 1991.

The majority of the Big Dig (Central Artery / Tunnel Project) was completed by the middle of 2005 at an estimated cost of $14.625 billion.

Existing Central Artery, an elevated six-lane highway, replaced by an extended subterranean highway, and a 14-lane two bridge crossing of the Charles River at the northern end.

Extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) from its former end, south of downtown Boston, through a tunnel (Ted Williams Tunnel) under South Boston and Boston Harbor to Logan Airport.

The northbound Central Artery tunnel started to carry traffic in March 2003, while the southbound lanes were opened in December 2003, allowing for the completion of the largest of the Charles River bridges.

Four lanes of I-93 southbound were opened in December 2003, while the remaining two lanes opened in early 2005.

Major project objectives Northbound Central Artery, Southbound Central Artery, Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge, Leverett Circle Connecter Bridge, Ted Williams Tunnel, I-90 Extension and Interchanges.

The four-lane Ted Williams Tunnel forms part of the I-90 extension link.

The overall design and construction management for the Big Dig has been provided by a joint venture of Bechtel, Parsons Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas.

The project also included the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel (extending Interstate 90 to Logan International Airport), the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge over the Charles River, and the Rose...

The Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T), known unofficially as the Big Dig, was a megaproject in Boston that rerouted the Central Artery (Interstate 93), the chief highway through the heart of the city, into a 3.5-mile (5.6-km) tunnel.

The project also included the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel (extending Interstate 90 to Logan International Airport), the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge over the Charles River, and the Rose Kennedy Greenway in the space vacated by the previous I-93 elevated roadway.

Initially, the plan was also to include a rail connection between Boston's two major train terminals.

The project concluded on December 31, 2007, when the partnership between the program manager and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority ended.

The Central Artery/Tunnel Project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority with design and construction supervised by a joint venture of Bechtel Corporation and Parsons Brinckerhoff . Due to the enormous size of the projectÃ¢â¬âtoo large for any company to undertake aloneÃ¢â¬âthe design and construction of the Big Dig were broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included Jay Cashman , Modern Continental , Obayashi Corporation , Perini Corporation , Peter Kiewit Sons' , J.F. White , and the Slattery division of Skanska USA.

The next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened in March 2003 and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20 , 2003. A tunnel underneath Leverett Circle connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19 , 2004 , easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5 , 2005 , including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished Dewey Square Tunnel .

The 10-lane, $100 million Leonard B. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge over the Charles River was opened to I-93 traffic at the northern end of the project in 2001.

Officially called the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T), it represents major construction advances.
