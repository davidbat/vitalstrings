Manchester City and Italy striker Mario Balotelli.

Mario Balotelli started Manchester City's match against Spurs on the bench, so the first half was obviously terrible and scoreless.

After taking a bit of time to let his mohawk settle into a rhythm, Balotelli -- Man City's lone substitute in the match -- revved the "Why Always Me?" machine by tripping over a downed Scott Parker and stepping on the Spurs midfielder's head as he fell over himself ( gif of it here ) in the 83rd minute.

Michel Platini has warned Mario Balotelli that if he were to walk off the pitch for being racially abused Ã¢â¬â as he suggested he would last week Ã¢â¬â during a match at Euro 2012 then he would be booked.

Balotelli said last week that he would leave the field of play if he was targeted, but Platini warned the Italy forward, and every other player, to do nothing rash.

The Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli was warned yesterday by Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi that he must behave and accept the authority of the coach Cesare Prandelli or risk undermining his team in their Euro 2012 quarter-final against England on Sunday.

James Milner, Balotelli's City team-mate, said that the striker was an unpredictable character, whose approach to games would change according to his mood.

Balotelli picked up two red cards and nine bookings for City in the season just passed, as well as the incident in which his house was set alight by fireworks ignited in his bathroom in October.

The controversial 21-year-old was a prominent theme in yesterday's press conference with De Rossi, in which the Roma midfielder made no attempt to hide his occasional exasperation at Balotelli's inability to control his emotions around football.

There is one who sometimes turns up in training and sometimes it is a bit cold and he is not too interested and there is the other time when he is really on to it and he is a special talent.

He is top player, we know that but the lads at the back have been brilliant and I'm sure they'll continue to do that and hopefully we will cause them a few problems going the other way.

He is very strong, shooting he can cause problems, he is tricky, he's strong and he's a clever player as well.

"He's a great player, so if he wants to grow up, he has to know how to react to this kind of high-pressure game," De Rossi said.

The Roma midfielder was a protÃÂ©gÃÂ© of the former England manager who promoted him during his time in charge of the club and set him on his way to his international career.

Asked whether there was a possibility that Balotelli could be at risk of a yellow card or worse against an England defence that has been one of the best aspects of the team in this tournament, De Rossi said: "Up to a certain point.

Balotelli has refused to speak at all since the Italy team arrived at their base in Krakow, turning down daily requests from the Italian media.

He remains a subject of fascination in Italy as much as he retains a cult status in England, even though there is still no certainty that Balotelli will start Sunday's game in Kiev, having been a substitute in the last game against the Republic of Ireland in which he scored a well-executed second goal in their 2-0 win.

Italy coach Cesare Prandelli left Balotelli out of the squad for a friendly against the United States in February after he received a four-match suspension a month earlier for his stamp on TottenhamÃ¢â¬â¢s Scott Parker.

With PrandelliÃ¢â¬â¢s urging, Balotelli issued a public apology in April for another act of indiscipline with City, having picked up his fourth red card in two seasons, for lunging at Arsenal defender Bacary SagnaÃ¢â¬â¢s knee.

And earlier this season, Balotelli had to come up with an explanation for English authorities after a fire broke out in his house when fireworks were let off in his bathroom.

No other player in ItalyÃ¢â¬â¢s team has the combination of talent and physical prowess that the 21-year-old Balotelli possesses, and that could be just what the Azzurri need in their European Championship opener against Spain in Gdansk this evening.

But Balotelli has struggled to harness his explosive behaviour, both on and off the pitch.
