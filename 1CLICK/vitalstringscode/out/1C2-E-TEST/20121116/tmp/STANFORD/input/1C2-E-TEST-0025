He achieved real stardom, however, as Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams ' play A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947 , directed by Kazan.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for that role, and in each of the next three years for his roles in Viva Zapata! in 1952 , Julius Caesar in 1953 and On the Waterfront in 1954 .

Under Kazan's direction, and with a talented ensemble around him, Brando used his method training and improvisational skills to produce a performance that continues to display new facets on each viewing.

Francis Ford Coppola was electrified by Brando's characterization as the head of a crime family, but had to fight the studio in order to cast him.

His career since then has been uneven: in addition to his quirky performance as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now and his intensely personal performance in Last Tango in Paris , Brando has also played Jor El, Superman's father, in the first Superman movie--a role he agreed to only on condition that he did not have to read the script beforehand and his lines would be displayed somewhere offscreen.

Marlon Brando (born April 3 , 1924 ) is an American actor who brought the techniques of method acting to prominence in the films A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront , both directed by Elia Kazan in the early 1950s.

His acting style, combined with his public persona as an outsider uninterested in the Hollywood of the early 1950s, had a profound effect on a generation of actors, including James Dean and Paul Newman , and later stars, including Robert De Niro .

Brando finally won the Oscar for his role of Terry Malloy in On The Waterfront.

Under Kazan's direction, and with a talented ensemble around him, Brando used his Stanislavski System training and improvisational skills.

Brando followed that triumph by a variety of roles in the 1950s that defied expectations: as Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls , where he managed to carry off a singing role; as Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for the U.S. Army in postwar Japan in The Teahouse of the August Moon ; as an Air Force officer in Sayonara , and a Nazi officer in The Young Lions .

Though even at this professional low point, Brando still managed to produce a few exceptional films; such as One-Eyed Jacks ( 1961 ), a western that would be the only film Brando would ever direct, Reflections in a Golden Eye ( 1967 ) portraying a repressed gay army officer, and Burn! ( 1969 ) which Brando would later claim as his personal favourite, although a commercial failure.

Nonetheless, his career had gone into almost complete eclipse by the end of the decade thanks to his reputation as a difficult star and his record in overbudget or marginal movies.

Francis Ford Coppola was electrified by Brando's characterization as the head of a crime family, but had to fight the studio in order to cast him.

Brando was voted the Academy Award for Best Actor for his intelligent performance; once again, he improvised important details that lent more humanity to what could otherwise have been a clichÃÂ©d role.

His career afterwards was uneven: in addition to his iconic performance as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now , Brando also played Jor-El , Superman's father, in the first Superman movie Ã¢â¬â a role he agreed to only on condition that he did not have to read the script beforehand and his lines would be displayed somewhere offscreen.

Brando became known as much for his crusades for civil rights , Native American rights and other political causes as he was for his acting.

A remake of Mutiny on the Bounty in 1962 , with Brando as Fletcher Christian seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star.

Anthony Quinn, my co-star in 'Viva Zapata!' (1952) once told my first wife Anna Kashfi, "I admire Marlon's talent, but I don't envy the pain that created it.".

Shortly afterwards, director Elia Kazan suggested me for the part of Stanley Kowalski in the production of Tennessee Williams' play 'A Streetcar Named Desire'.

Director Francis Ford Coppola convinced Brando to submit to a "make-up" test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the puffed-cheek look).

Thomas declined the role and actually urged the studio to cast Brando at the behest of Coppola and others who had witnessed the screen test.

Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.

The actor followed with one of his greatest performances in Bernardo Bertolucci 's Last Tango in Paris , but the performance was overshadowed by an uproar over the erotic nature of the film.

After his week was over, Director Francis Ford Coppola asked him to stay an extra hour so that he could shoot a close up of Brando saying, "The horror, the horror.".

He agreed to the role only on assurance that he was paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he did not have to read the script beforehand and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera.

Two years after his death, he "reprised" the role of Jor-El in the 2006 "loose sequel" Superman Returns , in which both used and unused archive footage of Brando as Jor-El from the first two Superman films was remastered for a scene in the Fortress of Solitude , as well as Brando's voice-overs being used throughout the film.

Brando became known as much for his crusades for civil rights , Native American rights and other political causes as he was for his acting.

Cox's third wife only discovered he possessed them after reading an interview in Time where Brando is quoted as saying: "I have Wally's ashes in my house.

He was blamed for a change in director and a runaway budget, though he disclaimed responsibility for either.

A 1961 article on Teriipia in the fan magazine Motion Picture described Brando's delight at how naÃÂ¯ve and unsophisticated she was.

Critics voted him "Broadway's Most Promising Actor" for his role as an anguished veteran in Truckline CafÃÂ©, although the play was a commercial failure .

Brando sought out that role, driving out to Provincetown, Massachusetts , where Williams was spending the summer, to audition for the part.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for that role, and again in each of the next three years for his roles in Viva Zapata! in 1952, Julius Caesar in 1953 as Mark Antony , and On the Waterfront in 1954.

Brando followed that triumph by a variety of roles in the 1950s that defied expectations: as Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls , where he managed to carry off a singing role; as Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for the U.S. Army in postwar Japan in The Teahouse of the August Moon ; as an Air Force officer in Sayonara ; and a Nazi officer in The Young Lions .

In the 1960s Brando starred in films such as Mutiny on the Bounty (1962); One-Eyed Jacks (1961), a western that would be the only film Brando would ever direct; Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967), portraying a repressed gay army officer; and Burn! (1969), which Brando would later claim as his personal favorite, although it was a commercial failure.

His behavior got him kicked out of the cast of the New School's production in Sayville, but he was discovered in a locally produced play there and then made it to Broadway in the bittersweet drama I Remember Mama in 1944.

Brando sought out that role, driving out to Provincetown, Massachusetts, where Williams was spending the summer, to audition for the part.

True to his method, Brando spent a month in bed at a veterans' hospital to prepare for the role.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for that role, and again in each of the next three years for his roles in Viva Zapata! in 1952, Julius Caesar in 1953 as Marc Antony, and On the Waterfront in 1954.

While he won an Oscar nomination for his acting in Sayonara, his acting had lost much of its energy and direction by the end of the 1950s.

In the 1960s Brando starred in films such as Mutiny on the Bounty (1962); One-Eyed Jacks (1961), a western that would be the only film Brando would ever direct; Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967), portraying a repressed gay army officer; and Burn!

Director Francis Ford Coppola convinced Brando to submit to a "make-up" test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the puffed-cheek look).

Brando is best known for his roles in A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront, both directed by Elia Kazan in the early 1950s, and his Academy-Award winning performance as Vito Corleone in The Godfather and as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, the latter two directed by Francis Ford Coppola in the 1970s.

Brando turned down the Academy Award, the second actor to refuse a Best Actor Oscar (the first being George C. Scott for Patton).

Brando boycotted the award ceremony, sending little-known actress Sacheen Littlefeather to state his reasons, which were based on his objections to the depiction of Native Americans by Hollywood and television.

The actor followed with one of his greatest performances in Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris, but the performance was overshadowed by an uproar over the erotic nature of the film.

After his week was over Director Francis Ford Coppola asked him to stay an extra hour to so he could shoot a close up of him saying, "The horror, the horror.".

Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, Superman II, but the producers refused to pay him the enormous percentage he was paid for the first movie, so he denied them permission to use the footage.

Other later performances, such as The Island of Dr Moreau, earned him some of the most uncomplimentary reviews of his career.

Interestingly, Cammell dated and eventually married the daughter of one of Brando's girlfriends, Anita Loo aka Anita Kong; the daughter being China Kong.

In middle age, his well-known roles include his Academy Award-winning performance as Vito Corleone in The Godfather, Colonel Walter Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, both directed by Francis Ford Coppola and an Academy Award-nominated performance as Paul in Last Tango in Paris.

He was named the fourth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the American Film Institute, and part of Time magazineÃ¢â¬â¢s Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century.

More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams Ã¢â¬Ë A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola Ã¢â¬Ës Apocalypse Now (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando.

Brando was an activist, lending his presence to many issues, including the American Civil Rights and American Indian Movements.

Along with his iconic performance as the rebel-without-a-cause Johnny in The Wild One (1953) (Ã¢â¬ÅWhat are you rebelling against?Ã¢â¬Â.

The problem that an intelligent performer has in movies is that it is the director, and not the actor, who has the power in his chosen field.
