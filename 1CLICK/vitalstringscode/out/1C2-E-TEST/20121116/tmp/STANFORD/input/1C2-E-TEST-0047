Under CorbettÃ¢â¬â¢s plan, each of the stateÃ¢â¬â¢s 18 congressional districts Ã¢â¬â which are being gerrymandered so that as many as 12 of them favor Republicans Ã¢â¬â would choose how to allocate a single electoral vote rather than having all of the stateÃ¢â¬â¢s votes go to the winner of the state.

Nevertheless, Corbett and his chief ally in the legislature, GOP Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, are not swayed by these congressmenÃ¢â¬â¢s claim that it is more important to protect their seats than it is to steal the election.
