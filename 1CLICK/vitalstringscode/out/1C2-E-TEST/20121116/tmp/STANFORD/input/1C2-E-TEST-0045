[101] As mayor, he did raise property taxes to fund budget projects; however, in January 2007 he proposed cuts in property taxes by five percent and cuts in sales taxes, including the elimination of taxes on clothing and footwear.

Despite the fact that 68 percent of New York City's registered voters are Democrats, Bloomberg decided the city should host the 2004 Republican National Convention.

His younger sister, Marjorie Tiven, has been Commissioner of the New York City Commission for the United Nations , Consular Corps and Protocol, since February 2002.

Bloomberg assumed office as the 108th Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2002.

Bloomberg has chosen to apply a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making.

The New York Times reported that little new city money is likely to be invested to fight poverty; management reform will be the main source of improvements.

In late May 2011, he was criticized for a budget proposal which would close 110 day care centers in the city, according to the public advocate's office.

15, 2011, a reporter asked Mr. Bloomberg about a planned protest in the financial district.

Most voters in New York City disapproved of Mr. BloombergÃ¢â¬â¢s handling of the Occupy Wall Street protests and believed that he had lost focus in his third term, according to a survey released Dec.

Yet at a time when many politicians nationwide were faring poorly in polls, city voters still liked the overall job Mr. Bloomberg wasÃÂ  doing.

Mr. Bloomberg would tell friends that only four other jobs could lure him from Bloomberg L.P.: president of the United States or of the World Bank, secretary general of the United Nations or mayor of New York.

Originally a Democrat, he switched his enrollment to independent in 2008 and, running in 2009 on the Republican and Independence Party lines, he won a third term Ã¢â¬â only the fourth New York mayor in a century to do so.

Perhaps his biggest legacy was finally winning mayoral authority over the cityÃ¢â¬â¢s failing public schools, which had been run by a seven-member Board of Education (with only two appointed by the mayor).

Mr. Bloomberg had previously supported the City CharterÃ¢â¬â¢s two-term limit, but reversed himself in 2008 when he decided to seek a third term, supporting Council legislation to extend the limit.

He defeated Fernando Ferrer with 62 percent of the vote, the most ever received by a non-Democrat running for mayor of New York.
