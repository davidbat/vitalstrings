Aaron Rodgers Loves it When Players Mock His Belt Celebration.

Aaron Rodgers has become known for his title belt celebration almost as much as heÃ¢â¬â¢s known for his MVP play on the field.

The championship belt nearly culminated when teammate Clay Matthews gave Rodgers a real wrestling belt after the Packers won the Super Bowl, but the celebration truly went viral when State Farm used it in a commercial.

Steelers Mimic of Aaron RodgersÃ¢â¬â¢ Championship Belt Celebration During Game: In case you arenÃ¢â¬â¢t aware of AaronÃ¢â¬â¢s trademark celebration, you can see a clip here .ÃÂ  I think itÃ¢â¬â¢s pretty awesome.ÃÂ  Some players on opposing teams have imitated this celebration on occasion (for instance, when Rodgers is sacked), which leads to this prop bet.ÃÂ  I donÃ¢â¬â¢t think there will be much reason for anyone on the Steelers to be doing this tomorrow, which is why IÃ¢â¬â¢m taking the big no on this one.ÃÂ  This concludes my proposition analysis and leads me to my actual pick for the game:.

Packers QB Aaron Rodgers enjoys celebrating his touchdowns by securing an invisible wrestling belt around his waist. On Super Bowl Sunday, should the quarterback find himself in the endzone, his touchdown celebration will have more substance. Rodgers became the WWE champion on MondayÃ¢â¬â¢s edition of Ã¢â¬ÅRawÃ¢â¬Â after defeating The Miz in a no-disqualification match. The quarterback pinned the former champion after an assist from John Cena.

The dance, which consists of Rodgers strapping on an imaginary championship belt (whether itÃ¢â¬â¢s a boxerÃ¢â¬â¢s belt or a wrestlerÃ¢â¬â¢s belt remains unclear) has been featured heavily this season.

Thanks to 28 touchdown passes and four touchdown runs, football fans everywhere were able to become awfully familiar with Aaron RodgersÃ¢â¬â¢ Ã¢â¬Åchampionship beltÃ¢â¬Â touchdown celebration.ÃÂ  By the time he was lifting the Lombardi Trophy following a 31-25 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers at Super Bowl XLV, everyone knew the meaning behind the two-handed gesture that the Packers quarterback was often seen making just above his crotch area.ÃÂ  However, when A-Rod first broke out the celebration, not everyone was on the same page as him, including Packers head coach Mike McCarthy.

According to McCarthy, Rodgers first broke out the celebration in practice, at which time he believe it had some sort of sexual connotation behind it.ÃÂ  After realizing what Rodgers hands were being wrapped around an imaginary belt, and not an imaginary woman, the Super Bowl MVP was free to flaunt his belt whenever and wherever he wished.
