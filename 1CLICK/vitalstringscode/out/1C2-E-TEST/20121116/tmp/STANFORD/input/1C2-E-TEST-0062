Whether it was wearing Bible verses under my eyes in college, or wearing John 3:16 in the national championship game Ã¢â¬Â¦ Because every time I do that, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s humbling for me because I know where my strength comes from.

For readers who donÃ¢â¬â¢t follow the NFL, let me explain that Tim Tebow is a Heisman trophy winner who led the University of Florida to two mythical national collegiate championships.

Many consider Tebow the greatest college football player ever, although there is a lot of skepticism about whether his skills will translate to the pro game.

Thanks to the notoriety, the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Florida -- a burly specimen who lacks the passing touch of most NFL quarterbacks -- can command about $500,000 annually from sponsorship deals.

NFL quarterback Tim Tebow has become a genuine media star since being named a starter in October and leading the slumping Denver Broncos to five wins in his first six games and into playoff contention.

Ã¢â¬ÅTim TebowÃ¢â¬â¢s success as the quarterback of the Denver Broncos has done little to silence his critics, who believe that his faith in Jesus Christ has no business on the football field,Ã¢â¬Â writes Todd Starnes.

Ã¢â¬ÅIt doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t matter how many touchdown passes he throws or how many games he wins because Tebow will always be a lightning rod for anti-Christian bigots.Ã¢â¬Â.

But nothing Tebow does on the football field or off it is going to make me feel any different about abortion Ã¢â¬â no matter how strongly he comes out against it.

To his most ardent Christian supporters, Tebow is not merely a quarterback, but JesusÃ¢â¬â¢ champion on the football field.

As with Tebow, as with the larger ongoing national argument about evangelical Christians and their place in culture and politics: two American cultures butting heads, seeing only the worst in the other, and over-reacting to perceived slights and threats.

A dual-threat quarterback who can run and pass, he was used in his freshman season largely as a change-of-pace to the Gators' more traditional pocket passer, Chris Leak. His contribution as a key reserve helped the Gators win college football's national championship game for the first time since 1996.

He also became the first NCAA player to rush and pass for 20 touchdowns in a season. His performance has made him among the polled favorites for the 2007 Heisman trophy.

The fifth child of Bob and Pam Tebow, both of whom are University of Florida graduates, Tim was born on August 14, 1987 in the Philippines, where his parents were serving as Christian missionaries.

All of the Tebow children were homeschooled by their mother who also worked to instill the family's deep religious beliefs along the way.

The 6'3", 225 lb (1.91 m, 102 kg) quarterback continued to impress during his senior season, leading the Nease Panthers to a state title, earning All-State honors, was named Florida's Mr. Football and a Parade All-American.

He played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl Game in San Antonio, Texas which features the top 78 senior high school football players in the nation and is shown nationally on NBC television.

Tebow was considered one of the nation's top recruits and was the subject of an ESPN "Faces in Sports" documentary.

Tim Tebow was also featured in Sports Illustrated on the "Faces in the Crowd" page.

On January 7, 2007, Tebow was featured prominently in an ESPN "Outside The Lines" feature on homeschooled athletes seeking equal access to high school athletics in other states.

Tebow was named as one of the "Breakout Players of 2007" for college football by Sporting News , and will start at quarterback for the Florida Gators in the 2007 season. The Gators' offense in 2007 should be similar to what Urban Meyer used at Utah, since Meyer views Tebow as "very similar to Alex Smith.".

This is a video I compiled of Tim Tebow's miraculous story, the son of missionaries in the Philippines whose mother almost died and Tim almost died several times.

Tim Tebow threw three touchdown passes Ã¢â¬â including the decisive score with just under 3 minutes remaining Ã¢â¬â to lead the No. 2 Gators to a 31-20 victory over No. 1 Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game on Saturday.

Tebow has led the Gators to a 12-1 record in 2008.

On December 13, 2008, Tim Tebow finished third in the 2008 Heisman Trophy voting with Oklahoma's Sam Bradford taking the top spot followed by Texas' Colt McCoy, despite Tebow receiving the most first-place votes. Tim Tebow also won the Maxwell Award in 2008, becoming only the second player to win the award twice.
