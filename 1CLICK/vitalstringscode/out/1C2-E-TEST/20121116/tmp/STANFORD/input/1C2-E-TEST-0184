What determines a body of waterÃ¢â¬â¢s salinity is not whether itÃ¢â¬â¢s called an ocean, sea, or lake but rather how fast salts are added and water is evaporated.

Water evaporates from the ocean and moves land-ward to rain down onto rivers.

Some parts of the ocean have more salt than others, most lakes and rivers taste fresh, and the Dead Sea is so salty it can barely support life.

There are also some places in the ocean floor where salty gases and minerals from within the Earth get released into the ocean! ÃÂ .

In time the salt dissolved, and today the ocean is salty.

The water in the oceans has more salt then river water.

One commonly held belief is that the salt in sea water is from land run off, coming via the rivers to the sea.

However if this were the case, then surely the seas would get more and more salty?Â  In fact scientists have proven that the salt concentration in the sea has remained the same for over 200 million years.

If we compare the different solutes dissolved in sea water to river water, we find very different percentages, river water only contains a small amount of chlorine and sodium (about 5% each), but a lot of bicarbonate, calcium and sulphate ions, 35%, 20% and 12% respectively.Â  The sea as we know is mostly chlorine (55%) and sodium (31%), and only 0.4% bicarbonate, 1% calcium and 8% sulphate.

The rain that falls on the land contains some dissolved carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic due to carbonic acid (which forms from carbon dioxide and water).

Salt in the ocean comes from rocks on land.

The rain that falls on the land contains some dissolved carbon dioxide from the surrounding air.

The rain erodes the rock and the acid breaks down the rocks and carries it along in a dissolved state as ions.

Many of the dissolved ions are used by organisms in the ocean and are removed from the water.

The USGS goes on to explain that, "By some estimates, if the salt in the ocean could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet (166 m) thick, about the height of a 40-story office building.".

Throughout the world, rivers carry an estimated 4 billion tons of dissolved salts to the ocean annually.

About the same tonnage of salt from the ocean water probably is deposited as sediment on the ocean bottom, and thus, yearly gains may offset yearly losses.

Past accumulations of dissolved and suspended solids in the sea do not explain completely why the ocean is salty.

Salts become concentrated in the sea because the SunÃ¢â¬â¢s heat distills or vaporizes almost pure water from the surface of the sea and leaves the salts behind.

This process is part of the continual exchange of water between the Earth and the atmosphere that is called the hydrologic cycle.

Evaporation from both the land and the ocean again causes water to return to the atmosphere as vapor and the cycle starts anew.

The ocean, then, is not fresh like river water because of the huge accumulation of salts by evaporation and the contribution of raw salts from the land.

Around 3.5% of ocean water is comprised of salts, depending on where in the world one is; equatorial waters tend to be saltier, while northern waters are slowly becoming more fresh.

The ocean floor is also constantly renewing itself, another way to make the ocean salty, as seafloor spreading releases even more dissolved minerals into the water, in the form of emissions from hydrothermal vents and cracks in the seafloor.

As time goes on the sun's heat distils or vaporizes almost pure water from the surface of the sea, and this leaves the salts and minerals behind.

The water returns to the ocean, via rivers or rain washing down even more salt which becomes ever more concentrated.

The saltiness in our oceans is the result of millions of years of minerals leaching and dissolving from the stones and rocks found within the earth.

While the largest proportion of dissolved salts comes from our rivers, a good quantity of these salts are dissolved from rocks and sediments below the ocean floor, and released through volcanic vents.

To a lesser degree the weather is also a contributing factor as rain also deposits mineral particles into the oceans.

Rain water, or precipitation, is slightly acidic due to dissolved compounds.

The salt(s) then flow down rivers and streams to their final destination in the oceans, where they remain.

Over the course of millions of years, this salt has accumulated to be a substantial component of the oceans.

The weather is also responsible, to a lesser degree, as the rain deposits mineral particles into the oceans.

The prehistoric seas must have been only slightly salty, but over thousands of years, rain has slowly eroded the rocks that make up Earth's crust.

These droplets fall to earth as rain (precipitation). â¢ â¢The rain runs into streams and rivers, which eventually flow into lakes or the sea and the cycle begins all over again.

Thatâs not to say you canât get saltier seas â like the Dead Sea â these are just bodies of water cut off from the main ocean and in which more water is evaporating than being returned by rivers, so the water becomes more concentrated.

The salt in our oceans is the result of millions of years of minerals leaching and dissolving from the solid earth.

The major portion comes from rivers, while a good quantity of the salts are dissolved from rocks and sediments below the ocean floor, through volcanic vents.

The weather is also responsible, to a lesser degree, as the rain deposits mineral particles into the oceans.

The sun's heat distills or vaporizes almost pure water from the surface of the sea, leaving the salts and minerals behind.

The water returns to the ocean, via rivers or precipitation, to wash down more salt, which becomes ever more concentrated.

Answer II Rain water, or precipitation, is slightly acidic due to dissolved compounds.

When this acidic water beats down on the land and rocks, they end up dissolving the minerals in the rocks and return them to the water.

The salt(s) then flow down rivers and streams to their final destination in the oceans, where they remain.

Over the course of millions of years, this salt has accumulated to be a substantial component of the oceans.

The concentrations of salts are indeed recycled back into the earth as a plate subducts under another.

Clanad(16:03 on Sat 28/Oct/06) Clanad Until about twenty years ago, theory suggested that, over millions of years, dissolved mineral that flowed into the oceans from rivers and streams, was responsible for the saltiness.

It's also believed that under sea volcanos contribute significantly to the saline content...

Salt naturally occurs in soil and rocks, on land and under the sea.

It washes into the ocean in rivers and comes up in vents from below the ocean bottom.
