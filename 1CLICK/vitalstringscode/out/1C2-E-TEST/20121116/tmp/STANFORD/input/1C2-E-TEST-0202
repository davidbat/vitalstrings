However I think the losses will be short term as the market mayÂ already have priced in expectations for this.

The increased pressure on the pound to fall meant the government had to maintain interest rates at very high levels, which in turn exacerbated the downturn in the economy.

The disparity between member states could lead to further social and economic problems, particularly in countries that used to be part of the former Soviet bloc where it is acknowledged that they are a long way behind the economic development of existing members.

The euro is the common currency used by 12 of the 25 EU member states.

Are UK business cycles and economic structures compatible with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?.

What effect would joining the euro have on the competitive position of the UK's financial services industry, particularly on the City of London's wholesale markets?.

Stability would increase as vulnerability to short term shocks would be reduced, (such as house price and interest rate rises), as would changes in the exchange rate which affect the level of exports.

This strengthened monetary policy co-ordination and prepared for the establishment of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).

Â  The final stage started in January 1999 with the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates of the old currencies to the euro, the transfer of monetary policy to the European Central Bank and the introduction of the euro.

The rate at which the UK might join the euro is important because this would determine relative prices.

If the UK joined at too high a rate, it would mean that exporters would find that their prices had effectively risen making them less competitive whilst imports would appear cheaper.

The disruption to our competitive position could have long-term effects as businesses would have to find ways of regaining the competitiveness that they had lost.

Rising economic powers like China will have their own agendas, virtually assuring that any place at the table we would be given in exchange for abdicating our sovereignty over accounting standards used by US companies would be temporary.

The UK did not meet the monetary conditions to join the Euro in the early 90s (remember John Major and mini recession). Also, from working in UK banks in the late 90s I got the impression they didn't want to take a risk, and adopted a wait and see attitude, I would have meant a loosening of control by the Bank of England.

So since then its more of a media campaign against it, seen as unpatriotic etc, rather than an educated debate, which is unfortunate. To say a country looses its identity because of the money in its pocket is ludicrous, I have yet to wake up and think I was living in a different country - and when in Greece, Spain, Belgium etc, I still manage to remember where I am. As I'm sure a British person would too.

Gordon Brown actually sold a large portion of our gold to buy Euro currency to replace it. Total madness.

Even when I was in the States I was asked if I wanted my credit card charged in Euro or USD, I chose USD because it would be cheaper. But the USD will recover, it has to.

Yes, but only if the government had been prepared to raise taxes and cut spending to compensate for interest rates that would have been far too low for comfort.

For more than six years, Britain's membership of the single currency has been a dead issue.

Another option to stimulate growth is for the few other countries that markets are still willing to lend to to borrow and spend more, offsetting spending cuts in southern Europe.

If national currencies still existed, countries like Greece and Portugal could resort to a proven means of reducing their lack of competitiveness.

Banks, in turn, would come under pressure, both in Greece and in the rest of the euro zone.

Before the financial crisis, Spain's government had lower debt levels than Germany's, and (unlike Germany) actually spent less than it earned in taxes.

Many European banks will also be offered state money to shore up their balance sheets.

However, there are concerns that the scheme will not go far enough and that the European Central Bank will not pay a central role.

They were not merely right about the single currency, the greatest economic issue of our age â they were right for the right reasons.

The corporation's twisted coverage of the EU is a serious problem, because the economic collapse of the eurozone means a new treaty may be needed very soon.

We were promised that the introduction of the euro would not lead to a fiscal transfer union in Europe.

One of the key strengths of the British economy, the flexibility of its labour markets, will be undermined at a stroke.

This is why the crises of a few euro countries are a crisis for the euro, as well as a crisis for the European Union, its governments and its institutions.

"The European Central Bank makes monetary policy for the whole of euroland.".

Only the ECB can truly bailout Greece or one of the other European nations, but it's precluded to do so by the Maastricht Treaty, which is the framework of European governance. So where will the money come from?.

From investors around the world who are now asking for ever higher interest rates because of the risk that goes with lending to these shaky economies?.

Then that means Greece simply knuckles under to the demands of the bureaucrats and the financial markets and it will have to continue to cut spending dramatically.

Political leaders are trying everything to put the best face on this and hold the euro together, but is there really any chance of saving the euro from collapse?.

Even if the European countries all toe the line and impose austerity measures to reduce deficits it will only make things worse.

On the surface and in their speeches and rhetoric they said that having a single currency would unite the European economy and make it more efficient and productive.

Under a single currency all countries that adopted the euro would have to give up their own monetary sovereignty.

Everybody was hopping on board and the euro started to look like an unbelievable success.

When push comes to shove only the Federal Government can bail out a state, but that's the difference.

I'm going to tell you something you may or may not already know...the European monetary system is on the brink of collapse and this could mean a fortune to you if you play it right..Â .

The politicians are forcing this on the Greek people, but it can only be done with heavy handed crackdowns, which are not working because we see that the protests are escalating.

Where do the Europeans get the money to bail out Greece or if necessary, the others that are on life support?.

Pressures had been mounting in the British economy and it was forced to de-peg its currency from the other European currencies and allow it to float freely in order to avoid skyrocketing interest rates and an economic crash.

The credit default swaps of European countries is rising and in the case of Greece they have gone parabolic. Billions in speculative bets are pouring in making the collapse almost a "fait accompli.".
