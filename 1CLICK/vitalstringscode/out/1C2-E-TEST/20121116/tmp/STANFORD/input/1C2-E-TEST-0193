Innovations include the first internal combustion automobile, honeycomb radiator cooling system, float carburettor, the first car to have brakes on all four wheels, safety cell design with front and rear crumple zones, traction control, airbags, pre-tensioned seat belts, and stability control.

"Our customers will experience with the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG the expertise of Mercedes-AMG, built up over 40 years of motor racing.

The 1990s also saw the return of Mercedes-Benz to GT racing, and the Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR , both of which took the company to new heights by dominating the FIA's GT1 class.

Mercedes-Benz is currently active in three forms of motorsport, Formula Three , DTM and Formula One .

Mercedes-Benz took part in the world championship in 1954 and 1955, but despite being successful with two championship titles for Juan-Manuel Fangio , [53] the company left the sport after just two seasons.

Mercedes-Benz returned as an engine supplier in the 1990s and part-owned Team McLaren for some years, to which it has supplied engines engineered by Ilmor [55] since 1995.

At the end of the season, Mercedes-Benz sold its 40% stake in McLaren to the McLaren Group and bought 70% of the Brawn GP team jointly with an Abu Dubai based investment consortium.

Brawn GP was renamed Mercedes GP for the 2010 season and is, from this season on, a works team for Mercedes-Benz.

The two companies which were merged to form the Mercedes-Benz brand in 1926 had both already enjoyed success in the new sport of motor racing throughout their separate histories.

The "safety cage" or " safety cell " construction with front and rear crumple zones was first developed by Mercedes-Benz in 1951.

In 1959, Mercedes-Benz patented a device that prevents drive wheels from spinning by intervening at the engine, transmission, or brakes.

A single Benz competed in the world's first motor race, the 1894 ParisÃ¢â¬âRouen , where Ãâ°mile Roger finished 14th in 10 hours 1 minute.

Mercedes-Benz has not made a large fuss about its innovations, and has even licensed them for use by competitorsÃ¢â¬âin the name of improving automobile and passenger safety.

Mercedes-Benz pioneered a system called Pre-Safe to detect an imminent crashÃ¢â¬âand prepares the car's safety systems to respond optimally.

On several occasions Mercedes-Benz has withdrawn completely from motorsport for a significant period, notably in the late 1930s, and after the 1955 Le Mans disaster , where a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR collided with another car and killed more than 80 spectators.

In the 1980s, Mercedes built the world's first robot car, together with the team of Professor Ernst Dickmanns at Bundeswehr University Munich .

For the beater enthusiast interested in fuel economy and long life, and who doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t mind looking like a middle-aged liberal arts college professor, the Mercedes-Benz W123 vehicles provide an ideal solution.

Not only to the Mercedes W123 chassis cars use a bomb-proof I-4 or I-5 diesel engine, but they also possessed side-impact door beams and were available with a driver side airbag and antilock brakes.

Nearly any W123 Mercedes you find in this country will also possess power windows, a four-speed Mercedes-built automatic transmission, and high-quality vinyl "MB-tex" or leather seating surfaces.

A Mercedes 280 or 300 is one of the rare older beaters into which we would feel perfectly comfortable strapping an infant seat.

The biggest benefit is horsepower and pep that American drivers will be more comfortable with, albeit with a fuel economy penalty.

Sure you have: That chassis designation covers the North American Mercedes 240D, 280E, 300D, and 300TD, along with a host of other alphanumerical combinations outside the States.

Mercedes Benz production is mainly based in Germany, but also there are several other countries that produces vehicles from this brand including: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, USA.

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz E350 replaces the E320 in the E-Class line, which makes up the heart of Mercedes-Benz models, offering good luxury and quality at a less-than-stratospheric price.

The contemporary interior design of the 2006 Mercedes-Benz E350 admits plenty of light for a spacious feel, and the standard burled-walnut trim with chrome binding provides a touch of old-world elegance.

The good: The 2006 Mercedes-Benz E350 features a sophisticated engine and transmission, while the cabin offers an auxiliary jack for an MP3 player, options for navigation, and a decent sound system.

Our only disappointment with this system is that it doesn't display ID3 tag information from MP3 CDs, forcing us to decipher sometimes esoteric filenames.

Our test 2006 Mercedes-Benz E350 may have been short on electronic goodies, but it definitely delivered in the drivetrain performance and handling departments.

It improves upon the previous 3.2-liter V-6 in its state-of-the-art mechanical and electronic technology.

Tumble flaps in the intake passages and dual-stage intake manifolds further improve efficiency and give it 258 pound-feet of torque between 2,400rpm and 5,000rpm, a broad, flat torque curve.

Mercedes-Benz's newest innovation, its 7G-Tronic transmission, uses seven gears, more than most contemporary cars' five- or six-speed automatics.

Individual gear ratios are spaced closer together for more seamless performance, while the overall gear-ratio spread is wider, for improvements in acceleration from lower low gears and highway fuel economy from higher high gears.

Unlike with the ML350, the 2006 Mercedes-Benz E350's gearshift is controlled by a regular console-mounted shift lever.

Our test car had the standard tuning of its four-link front, five-link rear suspension, not the optional sports tuning.

The steering is weighted nearly perfectly, plus it's neither too light for control nor too heavy for comfort.

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz E350 has been rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as one of the safest cars on the road.

As expected of a Mercedes-Benz, the 2006 E350 has a full complement of active and passive safety features.

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz E350's standard 48-month/50,000-mile warranty against defects in materials or workmanship can be extended by up to an additional 36 months, with total mileage up to 100,000 miles at any time during the initial warranty period.

Mercedes-Benz is a German automobile manufacturer and is a subdivision of Daimler AG.

The company was originally created by Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler in 1926.
