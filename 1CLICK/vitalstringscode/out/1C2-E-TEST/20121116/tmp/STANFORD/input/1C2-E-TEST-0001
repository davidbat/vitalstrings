[10] Murray tried to revive Jackson for five to ten minutes, at which point he realized he needed to call for help.

According to the affidavit, Jackson "was very familiar with" propofol "and referred to it as his 'milk.'" [47].

The Los Angeles Times wrote that the DEA was focusing on at least five doctors who prescribed drugs to Jackson, trying to determine whether they had had a "face to face" relationship with him, and whether they had made legally required diagnoses.

[48] The Sunday Times wrote that the police wanted to question 30 doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, including Arnold Klein.

[49] Klein said that he occasionally had given Jackson pethidine to sedate him, but had administered nothing stronger, and that he had turned his records over to the medical examiner.

Murray stated that he was hindered because there was no landline in the house.

Murray first met Jackson in Las Vegas when the doctor treated one of the singerâs children.

[44] Los Angeles police said the doctor spoke to officers immediately after Jackson's death, and during an extensive interview two days later.

Politician and minister Jesse Jackson , a friend of Michael Jackson's family, said that the family was concerned about Murray's role.

On January 11, 2011, the judge from Murray's preliminary hearing determined that Murray should stand trial for involuntary manslaughter in the Jackson case.

At about 12:20 p.m., 911 was called and by the time they arrived at Jackson's home, he was dead, according to Walgren.

In addition, once at the hospital, doctors also asked Murray about any substances administered and once again, he is accused of failing to inform them Jackson had been given a powerful anesthetic.

Only days after Jackson died, Murray met with police detectives and told them he had been giving the singer nightly doses of propofol for the past two months to help him with his insomnia.

In a Los Angeles Police Department recording, Murray can be heard telling authorities that on the morning that Jackson died, he went to the bathroom and came back just two minutes later to find the entertainer was not breathing.
