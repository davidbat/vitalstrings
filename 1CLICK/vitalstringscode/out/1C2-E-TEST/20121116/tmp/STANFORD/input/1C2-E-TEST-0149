With Sonovoid round forms, projects require less concrete, steel and supporting material, without sacrificing structural integrity and strength.

They can be purchased from your local building supplier and may be used to level a gazebo on a moderately steep slope.

Sonotube, also known as concrete footings, are used in situations where a gazebo needs to be raised, the ground is very uneven, or a building permit is required (i.e. in some areas a building permit is required if the area of the structure exceeds 110 square feet).

The bigfoots are connected to the sono tubes and placed in the holes, so the sono tubes are in line with the string line. Rebar is placed in the bigfoots and the bigfoot is buried to keep it in place.

Then the sonotubes are marked using the laser level to the desired height in relation to the footers. ÃÂ And now it's just a matter of cutting the tops off to this mark. ÃÂ And the sonotubes are ready for mud!.

The Sonotube brand of forming tubes have been the industry standard for more than 50 years.

Sonotube concrete forms stand strong as the most economical way to create columns for buildings, entranceways, structural support, light posts and other commercial and residential structures.

The superior strength-to-weight properties of Sonotube forms prevent blowouts and may eliminate the need to use a crane during setup.

Contractors around the world know Sonotube concrete forms stand strong in their superior technology and value.

Sono tubes are very popular because they are relatively inexpensive and require little in the way of specialized tools or equipment.
