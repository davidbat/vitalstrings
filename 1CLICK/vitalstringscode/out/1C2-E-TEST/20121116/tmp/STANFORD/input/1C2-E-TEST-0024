Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren),Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) -- with newest members Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Yu Nan) aboard -- are reunited when Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) enlists the Expendables to take on a seemingly simple job. The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time - six pounds of weapons-grade plutonium; enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that's nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary who savagely murdered their brother.

The testosterone-filled movie stars of The Expendables are no spring chickens, which makes the shape they are in all the more amazing.

Sure, THE EXPENDABLES completely relies on the nostalgia of those of us in our 30â²s and 40â²s that long for the days of 80â²s action movies, but the fact remains that we just canât turn away.Â  I didnât really like the first one, but Iâm still looking forward to THE EXPENDABLES 2.Â  Of the new additions to the cast, Iâm most excited for Jean-Claude Van Damme, whoâs films were a staple of my early teenage years and Iâd love to see the guy make a come back in theatrical movies.Â  I donât mind his B-movies, but he deserves better.Â  I know Chuck Norris has his fans, but Iâm okay if he remains in obscurity.

When Sylvester Stallone assembled his cast of bad-ass action stars for The Expendables, which included cameo appearances of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the only thing fans desired was more.

The movie, starringÃÂ  Arnold Schwarzenegger ,ÃÂ  Sylvester Stallone ,ÃÂ  Jean-Claude Van Damme ,ÃÂ  Bruce Willis ÃÂ andÃÂ  Chuck Norris , isÃÂ a romantic story of unrequited love in early Victorian England that follows the struggles of a ragtag band of men called The Expendables.ÃÂ .

Like his original on-screen alter ego, Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone has taken some punches, but also delivered many knockouts to go along with them.

After simple beginnings and a movie debut in a skin flick, Stallone used a real-life boxing match and his own life experiences to craft Rocky, a timeless underdog story that made Rocky Balboa the modern-day movie underdog.

Despite the mixed bag at times, Sylvester Stallone has now completed a successful evolution from nobody to capable screenwriter to action icon and filmmaker.
