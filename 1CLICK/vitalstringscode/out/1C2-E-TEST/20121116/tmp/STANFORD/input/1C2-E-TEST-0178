The sunlit sky is blue because air scatters short- wavelength light more than longer wavelengths.

Blue is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.

As the Sun gets lower in the sky, its light is passing through more of the atmosphere to reach you. Even more of the blue light is scattered, allowing the reds and yellows to pass straight through to your eyes.

Because when light passes through the atmosphere it's scattered. blue light is scattered the most, that's why.

When sunlight travels through the atmosphere, blue light scatters more than the other colors, leaving a dominant yellow-orange hue to the transmitted light.

Violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue light: It scatters even more than blue light does.

The sun puts out much more blue light than violet light, so most of the scattered light in the sky is blue.

Sunlight is made up of all different colors of light, but, because of the elements in the atmosphere, the color blue is scattered much more efficiently than the other colors.

The blueness you see everywhere else is all of the atoms in the atmosphere scattering blue light toward you.

A clear cloudless daytime sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the Sun more than they scatter red light.

When we look towards the Sun at sunset, we see red and orange colors because the blue light has been scattered out (filtered) and away from our line of sight.
