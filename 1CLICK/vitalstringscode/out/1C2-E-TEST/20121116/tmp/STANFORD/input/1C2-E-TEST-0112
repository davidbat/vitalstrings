Aside from the duck tour in Boston tickets themselves, the duck tour website offers discounts to a number of other Boston attractions.

Because Boston duck tours are aimed mostly at tourists, it can be difficult to find Boston duck tour discount tickets in the summer.

Outside the Old South Meeting House, in a stretch of downtown thick with sightseers, we came upon a tiny kiosk where a scruffy twenty something was selling tickets for something called Super Duck Tours, an amphibious-tour company new to town, and one that bore more than a passing resemblance to BrownÃ¢â¬â¢s business.

Boston Duck Tours sued its competitor, Super Duck Tours, claiming trademark infringement.

He said it specifically referred to the World War Two-Era amphibious vehicles Boston Duck Tours uses.

Super Duck Tours, which competes with Boston Duck Tours in offering land and water trips on amphibious vehicles, can't use "duck tour" in its name, according to the ruling by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton.

By Friday afternoon, Super Duck Tours had changed its name to Super Ducks. In a statement, owner Dennis Kraez, praised Gorton for rejecting Boston Duck Tours' claim that his company was interfering with Boston Duck Tours' business by harassing and misleading potential customers.

Brown said the confusion for customers was immediate, with some even showing up at Boston Duck Tours carrying Super Duck Tours tickets they purchased on the Internet, thinking it was the same company.

ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  Fledgling Super Duck Tours is accused of Ã¢â¬Åharassing potential Boston Duck Tours customersÃ¢â¬Â by Ã¢â¬ÅmisstatingÃ¢â¬Â Boston Duck Tours ticket prices or purporting that its rivalÃ¢â¬â¢s trips are sold out, according to the civil action.

ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  Boston Duck Tours claims in court papers they have been besieged with complaints from customers since Super Duck Tours splashed down on May 21, including one from a woman who thought they were the same company, just featuring Ã¢â¬Åa special Ã¢â¬ËsuperÃ¢â¬â¢ tour route.Ã¢â¬Â.

Tourists holding Super Duck Tours tickets began showing up to board Boston Duck Tours boats.

When Boston Duck ToursÃ¢â¬â¢ automated phone message still described the company as the cityÃ¢â¬â¢s only amphibious tour, Super Duck Tours demanded it make a new recording.

Ã¢â¬ÅDuck tours,Ã¢â¬Â he wrote in last monthÃ¢â¬â¢s initial ruling, may not be an entirely original term, but Ã¢â¬Åit has acquired a secondary meaning in the Boston area during the past 13 years.Ã¢â¬Â.

The idea of turning World War II amphibious landing vehicles into tour vehicles, like Lolly the Trolley, is a clever one.

We recite the background facts here, adding additional information throughout the analysis where appropriate. Both Boston Duck and Super Duck are in the business of offering sightseeing tours via land and water in Boston, using amphibious vehicles commonly referred to as Ã¢â¬Åducks.Ã¢â¬Â.

Since 1994, Boston Duck has offered sightseeing tours of the Boston area and Charles River, largely with genuine renovated DUKWs from World War II.

It explained this conclusion by stating that Ã¢â¬Å[Super Duck] knowingly and intentionally entered the Boston market offering a service, mark and logo nearly identical to that of Boston Duck Tours, an established and successful enterprise.Ã¢â¬Â.

The tour services offered by Boston Duck and Super Duck are similar, and the district court found them to be virtually identical.

Indeed, Boston Duck acknowledges on its website that it is not the first or the only duck tour. Therefore, although Boston Duck has more longevity than Super Duck, Boston Duck was not the first duck tour nor is it apparently the longest running duck tour in the industry. Boston Duck demonstrates that it is renowned in the Boston area for its sightseeing tours. Its fame is due at least in part, however, to the position it has enjoyed as the only duck tour service in the Boston area. Boston Duck's recognition in tour magazines and the awards it cites are focused on its unique Boston service. As such, the evidence does not show that Boston Duck has unusual renown in the industry as a whole, when compared to amphibious tours offered elsewhere.

38 Even Boston Duck's means of conveyance, the World War II DUKWs, is not unique. The record also shows that other duck tour companies have applied to register names with the term Ã¢â¬Åduck tours,Ã¢â¬Â including Super Duck, and that other trademarks which include the term Ã¢â¬Åduck toursÃ¢â¬Â have been registered with the PTO.

We begin with Boston Duck's trademark infringement claim against Super Duck based on the parties' word marks. On appeal, Super Duck challenges the district court's conclusion that Super Duck's use of its mark SUPER DUCK TOURS is likely to cause confusion among the relevant consumer public with Boston Duck's use of its mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.
