Whatever the explanation for purring, it seems to indicate cats' contentment and is associated with improvement in their affect at times of stress.

We may not always hear the purring â a soft vibrating rumble â but we can feel it.

The other theory is that the sound comes more from vibrating blood vessels than in the voicebox itself. Â³.

However, science has shown that the cat's purr is much more than just relaxing, it is the vibration that it produces that is the key!.

A kitten is able to purr by the second day of life, and although he can't meow and nurse at the same time, he can purr and nurse.

And the mother cat often purrs back, probably to reassure the kitten.

One study determined that purring involves activation of nerves within the voice box.

Veterinarian Neils C. Pederson, author of Feline Husbandry, believes that purring is initiated from within the central nervous system and is a voluntary act.

It is classified with the âmurmur vocalizationâ group, which involves sounds produced by a cat while the mouth is closed.

Some cats purr to indicate contentment or pleasure, but badly frightened cats and severely ill cats also purr, and so do females while they are delivering their kittens.

No one knows for sure why a domestic cat purrs, but many people interpret the sound as one of contentment.

In addition to purring when they are content, cats also purr when they are afraid, sick, in pain, or even dying.

A Purring Cat Is More Than Just A Happy Cat.

Scientists report that cats produce purring sounds by using the diaphragm to push air back and forth across vibrating nerves in the larynx.

Frightened cats may purr to communicate submissiveness or non-aggressive intentions.

A feral cat may purr to signal that he will not attack and other cats need not feel threatened.

Older cats may purr when they play or approach other cats, signaling that they are friendly and want to come closer.

Scientists at the University of Sussex showed in 2009 that purring, or some purring, seems to be a way for domesticated cats to signal their owners for food.

Domestic cats purr at a frequency of 25 to 150 vibrations per second.

It turns out that domestic cats, some wild cats like pumas and mountain lions (in general, any big cat that cannot roar) and even raccoons are all able to purr.

A purr is a sound which is made by domesticated cats and other species of the feline world and it is their way of communicating.

Another way for cats to purr has to do with their voice box and once these nerves have been given a signal, the vocal cords vibrate which causes the diaphragm to push air in and back out of the vocal chords and this creates the relaxing, humming of a purr.

Mother cats purr when nursing their kittens, and kittens purr when nursing.

Scientists report that cats produce purring sounds by using the diaphragm to push air back and forth across vibrating nerves in the larynx.

Frightened cats may purr to communicate submissiveness or non-aggressive intentions.

A kitten is able to purr by the second day of life, and although he can't meow and nurse at the same time, he can purr and nurse.

Purring involves activation of nerves within their voice box, and these nerve signals cause vibration of the vocal cords.

Air is pushed in and out of the vibrating cords and thus creating the musical purr.

Veterinarian Neils C. Pederson, author of Feline Husbandry, believes that purring is initiated from within the central nervous system and is a voluntary act, meaning that a cat only purr when it wants to.

When cats become soft purring bundles of warm reassuring fur, we feel calmer and more peaceful ourselves.

One study determined that purring involves activation of nerves within the voice box.

These nerve signals cause vibration of the vocal cords while the diaphragm serves as a piston pump, pushing air in and out of the vibrating cords, thus creating a musical hum.

The other theory is that the sound comes more from vibrating blood vessels than in the voicebox itself.

The human-feline bond is never quite so close as when a person is holding and petting a purring, vibrating bundle of fur on her lap, and all is well with the world.

Cat purrs will range from a deep rumble to a raspy, broken sound, to a high-pitched trill, depending on the physiology and/or the mood of a cat.

Some cats purr to indicate contentment or pleasure, but badly frightened cats and severely ill cats also purr, and so do females while they are delivering their kittens.

There are many theories to explain how the purr is generated. One study determined that purring involves activation of nerves within the voice box.

These nerve signals cause vibration of the vocal cords while the diaphragm serves as a piston pump, pushing air in and out of the vibrating cords, thus creating a musical hum.
