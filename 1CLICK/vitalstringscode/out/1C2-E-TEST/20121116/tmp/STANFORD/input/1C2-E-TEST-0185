Like every other cocktail on this list, the history behind the Bloody Mary is also a bit cloudy.

One popular legend says that the original Bloody Mary, which was then made using equal parts tomato juice and vodka and used as a hangover cure, was invented by comedian, songwriter and movie producer George Jessel (aka the âToastmaster General of the United Statesâ).

Jessel claimed he created the drink one morning in Palm Beach during the 1950s, when he mixed tomato juice and vodka as a way to recover from an entire night spent drinking.

Jessel even appeared in Smirnoff vodka ads in the 1950s declaring, âI, George Jessel invented the Bloody Mary.â.

However, as aptly put by Wall Street Journal columnist and cocktail historian Eric Felten, âGiven Jesselâs knack for self-promotion, many doubted his claim,â which made skeptics to search for the true origin of the drink and opened the door for a legend involving the head bartender at the St. Regis Hotel in New York named Fernand âPeterâ Petriot.

A classic cocktail dating back about 100 years, the Sidecar mixes equal parts brandy or Cognac, Cointreau and lemon juice.

The origin of the Sidecar is largely debated, but popular wisdom is that the drink was probably first created in Paris sometime during or just following WWI.

The drink immediately became so popular that other major hotels began serving it in their bars also, quickly popularizing the cocktail with a international crowd.

The history of the children's game Bloody Mary is a difficult one to extract from the large amount of mixed up legends and history that over the years has become the main basis for the story surrounding the game.

Bloody Mary is the children's game of summoning an evil and vengeful witch of the same name.

The other story accompanying the ritual is a local woman was involved in a fatal car accident nearby, her face horribly mutilated.

It is largely believed that the origins of the names "Mary Worth" and "Bloody Mary" came from a slight mix up of characters from history.

There is a lot of speculation as to the names being taken from Mary I, Queen of England who reigned during the Tudor period.

Her nickname of "Bloody Mary" became attached to her when she violently executed and burnt.

This is done by standing in a bathroom, with one candle lit and calling the name "Bloody Mary" into the mirror three times in a row.

She also was unable to bear children and suffered two phantom pregnancies, this is where it is speculated that the Bloody Mary game involving chanting "I stole your baby" or "I killed your baby" became tangled up with the now known Bloody Mary game.

The second answer is not correct, no offense to anyone but the first answer is correct, Mary did kill (not herself) but did send out her soldiers or something, she did send out people... to kill the protestants of England.

In folklore and children's street culture, "Bloody Mary" is a game in which a ghost of the same name (or sometimes other names, such as "Mary Worth") is said to appear in a mirror when her name is stated three times, though there are many variations.

Other variations say that the querier must not look directly at her, but at her image in the mirror; she will then reveal the querent's future, particularly concerning marriage and children.

On the other hand, various people have surmised that the lore about taunting Bloody Mary about her baby may relate her tenuously to folklore about Queen Mary I, known in history by the sobriquet "Bloody Mary".

As a result, some retelling of the tale make Bloody Mary the queen driven to madness by the loss of her children.

The epithet "Bloody Mary" is associated with a number of historical (particularly Queen Mary I of England) and fictional women, especially from folklore.

It is believed that inspiration for the cocktail was the Hollywood star Mary Pickford who earlier had a similarly red cocktail consisting of rum, Grenadine and Maraschino named after her.

Other sources trace the name to a waitress named Mary who worked at a Chicago bar called the Bucket of Blood.

In 1934, the cocktail was called "Red Snapper" at the St. Regis Hotel, where Petriot was hired at the time.

It was here that Tabasco sauce was added to the drink, and the name "Bloody Mary" eventually won popularity.

It is the epicentre of uncertainty: the birthplace of a multitude of falsified or misrepresented stories - from the Da Vinci code to the death of Princess Diana, that Thierry Henry handball and, most importantly, the Bloody Mary.

Harry's had by this time become a frequent hangout for Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis, Rita Hayworth, Humphrey Bogart and many other famous international and American icons.

The most popular story is that Petiot named it after Queen Mary Tudor of England.

She had taken the throne after a short battle against her dying brother Edward VI's wishes and the machinations of John Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland.

Queen Mary was fanatical supporter of the Catholic religion and it's well documented how much she detested the exploits of her father's divorce and schism that saw the creation of The Church of England.

Mary's 'Bloody' moniker is related to some of her first acts as Queen: first came the execution of Dudley and then the reinstitution of the Heresy Acts in 1554.

Under the Acts many, many protestants were killed under the Marian Persecutions, the main method of execution being death by fire.

It's believed many of the 283 killed under the Heresy Act died this way and gave Mary the unofficial title Queen "Bloody" Mary.

It said the Bucket of Blood was "a small, dark, sordid, dismal place and we couldn't stand it very long".

It was owned by George B. Dulgate, whose wife was indicted for the death of Marie Benzing, resulting from a botched abortion.

The actual name for Bucket of Blood is believed to stem from the way bar owners would throw the dirty, blood-stained water mopped from the floor after brawls and fatal stabbings into the street.

As one story has it, it was Vincent Astor, who took ownership of the hotel in 1935, who objected to the Bloody Mary name and insisted it be changed due to its vulgarity.

In his autobiography, The World I lived In!, he claimed to have created the drink during 1927 in Palm Beach, providing another narrative to its birth but arguably clouding the issue even further.

My whole raison d'etre as a bartender is to find out as much about my passion as is humanly possible: I'm fuelled by inquisitiveness and if ever I get the merest sniff of something that could overturn a previously-held belief, I will stop at nothing until I consider my opinion well-versed.

"Following the game myself, and a guy named Elliott Sperver, a Philadelphia playboy, went to La Maze's and started swilling champagne.
