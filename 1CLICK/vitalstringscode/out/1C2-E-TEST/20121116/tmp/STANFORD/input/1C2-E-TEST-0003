Perhaps theyÃ¢â¬â¢re not so influential anymore, but if youÃ¢â¬â¢ve been to a Green Day show recently, youÃ¢â¬â¢ll know they still rock the stage and care a lot about the fans.

As for it actually being good music, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s a matter of debate, but apparently the 65 million records theyÃ¢â¬â¢ve sold worldwide would indicate that a lot of people enjoy it.

Ã¢â¬ÅWhile Green Day has been more successful with their last two albums ( American Idiot, 21st Century Breakdown ) , they have lost most if not all of their original fan base, that consisted of people who loved to rock!Ã¢â¬Â.

[quote]Everyone has political views, EVERYONE, but the time and place for that is no way in hell found in punk rock music,[/quote].

[quote]So, when will it be enough Green Day?.

The audience was mostly teenagers, dressed in their best Hot Topic outfit and weÃ¢â¬â¢re even watching the concert.

Billy Joe got on stage and started to voice his opinions, which he is allowed to have but the audience wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t listeningÃ¢â¬Â¦.

Billy Joe started to rail against commericalism, this is when I blew a gasket.

In the background were images on the video wall of great bands in the past like 7-Seconds, Fugazi, Ramones, etc.

Right above the singers head was a huge sign that said Ã¢â¬ÅVERIZONÃ¢â¬Â, also there were signs for Papa Johns Pizza, Amtrak and some soft drink company (Pepsi or Coke).

When Green Day started, they might have been more punk but itÃ¢â¬â¢s hard to take them serious when their albums are sold at Wal-mart, they do the Nick KidÃ¢â¬â¢s Choice Awards and are multi-millionaireÃ¢â¬â¢s.

I know, just because someone has money doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t mean they are a sellout.

I just think their message is outdated, hollow and falling on deaf ears or at least ears that were too busy texting to pay attention.

Also, IÃ¢â¬â¢m not keen to calling Green Day punk in the traditional sense of the genre of music.

Ã¢â¬ÅGreen day used to be one of the most influential punk rock bands to date, from the days of Dookie and Kerplunk , from a time when they actually knew how to make music, when they used to rock the stage live, and CARE about their fansÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â.
