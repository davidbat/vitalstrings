As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases.

Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often.

As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.

Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon.

It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity.

It is almost certain however, that this hypothesis is not correct. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature.

Yawning is an involuntary reflex by the body to control the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood.

One likely explanation is that the yawning reflex is triggered when our blood needs more oxygen.

Another common theory is that the yawn help regulate our body temperature.

Other hypotheses suggest that the same chemicals in our brain that affect our moods and emotions cause us to yawn.

Yawning, then, would be an involuntary reflex (something we can't really control) to help us control our oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.

Another theory is that yawning stretches the lungs and lung tissue.

So, if we didn't yawn, according to this theory, taking a deep breath would become harder and harder â and that would not be good!.

One is that when we are bored or tired, we just don't breathe as deeply as we usually do.

[9] Yawns are often accompanied by the urge to stretch.

Similarly, a study by Jared Guttmann at Worcester Polytechnic Institute found that when a subject wearing earplugs yawned, a breeze is heard caused by the flux of the air moving between the subject's ear and the environment.

As more (or less) of these compounds are activated in the brain , the frequency of yawning increases.

It indicates an appreciation of other people's behavioral and physiological state." said Garrett.

It is also possible that yawning is a less potent territorial reflex.

[21] For example, theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood in gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack.

It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods.

The yawn reflex has long been observed to be contagious.

[8] [24] Observing another person's yawning face (especially his/her eyes), even reading, or thinking about yawning, or looking at a yawning picture can cause a person to yawn.

This is often accompanied by teeth chattering, purring and scent marking.

Dogs often yawn after seeing people yawn and when they are confused.

Yawning then is the central nervous system 's command so that the body can take in lots of oxygen and give off carbon dioxide to maintain balance or normal levels of gas exchange in the blood.

When a person yawns he is taking in a lot of oxygen and get rids of carbon dioxide.

It looks like yawning is contagious but I really have no idea at this point.

Paratroopers have been noted to yawn in the moments before they exit the aircraft.

Another notion states that yawning is the body's way of controlling brain temperature.

[15] [13] A similar recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature .

Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions , mood , appetite , and other phenomena.

Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opioid neurotransmitters such as endorphins reduces the frequency of yawning.

It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods.

[22] Often, if one person yawns, this may cause another person to "empathetically" yawn.

[8] Observing another person's yawning face (especially his/her eyes), even reading, or thinking about yawning, or looking at a yawning picture can cause a person to yawn.

A recent study by the University of London has suggested that the "contagiousness" of yawns by a human will pass to dogs.

In animals, yawning can serve as a warning signal.

Adelie Penguins employ yawning as part of their courtship ritual.

Penguin couples face off and the males engage in what is described as an "ecstatic display," opening their beaks and pointing their faces skyward.
