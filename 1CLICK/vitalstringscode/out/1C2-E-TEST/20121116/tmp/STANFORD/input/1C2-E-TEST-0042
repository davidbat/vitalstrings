The President turned to us all: "We are going to have to face the fact that, if we do invade, by the time we get to these sites, after a very bloody fight, they will be pointed at us.

He supervised everything, from the contents of leaflets to be dropped over Cuba to the assembling of ships for the invasion.

No more weapons to Cuba and those within Cuba withdrawn or destroyed, and you reciprocate by withdrawing your blockade and also agree not to invade Cuba.

Then, immediately, the President would have to decide whether he would use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union, and all mankind would be threatened.

The President ordered the Ex Comm to meet again at 9:00 P.M. in the White House.

He said he had just received word from the Russians that they had agreed to withdraw the missiles from Cuba.

At Cuba Conference, Old Foes Exchange Notes on 1962 Missile Crisis.

"As for U.S.-Cuba relations, they were as bad as they could get before the missile crisis, and the missile crisis confirmed them as being bad. The effect was to confirm Cuba as the enemy of the United States yet also constrain the U.S. from direct military force against Cuba," LeoGrande said.

Military convoys rumbled down South Florida's highways and many Americans around the country were digging bomb shelters even before Kennedy disclosed the U-2's photographs and warned the Soviets that any nuclear missile launched from Cuba would be regarded as an attack on the United States.

In Washington, Kennedy met with his Executive Committee of top advisers and after seven days of intense debate ordered a naval quarantine around Cuba -- approved on Oct.

A conference in Havana marking the 40th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis has ended with a visit by participants to sites related to the dispute that brought the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war.

The delegates - who include politicians, military figures and academics from the US, Russia and Cuba - travelled to an abandoned silo west of Havana where Soviet nuclear missiles had been deployed.

"It could have been the end of the world, but here we are 40 years later - Americans, Cubans, Russians," he added.

Fidel Castro, the Cuban president, attended most of the closed-door sessions in Havana and offered long commentaries.

Yet this suspenseful episode, perhaps the most dangerous moment in world history, cemented an antagonistic relationship between the United States and Cuba that outlasted the Cold War and stubbornly persists today.

On 6 June 1968, the Los Angeles office called me at about two o'clock in the morning to tell me that Robert Kennedy had been killed.

He tapped Chief of Homicide Detectives Hugh Brown, with whom he had worked for fifteen years, to head SUS, telling Brown that if there was a "great conspiracy" linking the RFK murder with those of JFK and Martin Luther King, Jr., it had better be unveiled because their work would be subject to "much fine-comb study.".

Kennedy was hit by four shots including one which lodged in the vertebrae in his neck and another which entered his brain from below his right ear.

The autopsy of Kennedy's body suggested that all four shots that hit him came from behind, and powder marks on his skin showed they must have been from close range.

"There is no doubt in our minds that no fewer than 14 shots were fired in the pantry on that evening and that Sirhan did not in fact kill Senator Kennedy," said Robert Joling, a forensic scientist who has been involved with the Kennedy case for nearly 40 years.

Persons associated with Trafficante and Marcello knew about RFK's Coup Plan, and discussed it in documented conversations before and alter JFK's assassination.

Robert Kennedy controlled the activities at the autopsy for national security reasons.

We call RFK's Coup Plan "Project Freedom" (the actual names for the operation are still classified), since his goal was freedom and democracy for the Cuban people Additional information from confidential sources close to these events will show how the secrecy surrounding "Project Freedom" was used by organized crime to force the government to cover-up even today) the mob's role in the death of JFK.

Robert Kennedy perceived so much hatred about, so many enemies: the Teamsters; the gangsters; the pro-Castro Cubans; the anti-Castro Cubans; the racists; the right-wing fanatics; the lonely deluded nuts mumbling to themselves in the night.

(2) In 1957 Robert Kennedy began his long campaign against Jimmy Hoffa , leader of the Teamsters Union.

Kennedy said to Sheridan something like: "You know, at the time I asked McCone... if they had killed my brother, and I asked him in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they hadn't."".

Kennedy asked Frank Mankiewicz of his Senate staff whether he thought Garrison had anything.

Kennedy told me later: "Walter Sheridan is satisfied that Garrison is a fraud.".

Moreover, it was RFK who suggested that the president ride through the streets of Dallas in a car without using the specially outfitted bulletproof bubble top.

The CIA's John McCone remembered conversations with the attorney general shortly after Jack's death: "He wanted to know what we knew about it and whether it had been a Cuban or perhaps Russian hit.

He first gained national recognition as chief counsel (1955-57) of the Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee in its investigation of Teamster Union executives David Beck and James Hoffa.

When his brother ran for president in 1960, Kennedy again went to manage the campaign.

In addition to serving as Attorney General, Robert was the president's confidante and closest advisor.

Kennedy resigned his cabinet post in 1964 to run for political office in New York.

In the spring of 1968 Kennedy, who disagreed with President Lyndon Johnson's policies, campaigned for the Democratic party nomination.

Robert also voiced opinions of his own, which greatly helped in the crisis resolution.

Perhaps Kennedy's most significant contribution was being adamantly opposed to an air strike from the outset.

You're going to announce the reason that you're doing it is because they're sending this kind of missiles, well, I think it's almost incumbent upon the Russians then to say, 'Well, we're going to send them in again, and if you do it again ... we're going to do the same thing to Turkey or ...

From his energetic approach to contacting Ambassador Dobrynin, Kennedy was an invaluble help to his brother and the world.

Rumors of ties between the Kennedys and the Mafia go back to John F. Kennedy's father, Joe Kennedy, who reportedly earned much of the family fortune as bootlegger and had connections to mobsters like Meyer Lansky.

One theory attributes motive to the Mafia through the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.

It is Waldron and Hartmann's (The Edison Gene) contentionÃ¢â¬âbolstered by access to many previously unavailable files, and interviews with little-known as well as prominent figuresÃ¢â¬âthat the CIA knew a great deal about the assassination.

But the agency couldn't admit what it knew because that could uncover the existence of a U.S. plan for a coup in Cuba, run by JFK's brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

The assassination, say the authors, was carried out by hired gunmen on the orders of three noted Mafia dons whose lives were being made miserable by RFK's ruthless pursuitÃ¢â¬âand these Mafia men knew about the planned invasion because they had worked with the CIA on previous efforts to topple Castro.

Oswald, long a hidden CIA agent, was set up as the patsy, and it had always been Jack Ruby's job to eliminate him if he wasn't killed at the scene of Kennedy's shooting.
