Scouts for the club spotted Cannavaro playing and he eventually signed with the team while still a teenager before making his first-team debut in 1993.

Cannavaro was clearly one of Italian soccer's emerging young talents, so Napoli, struggling financially in the post-Maradona era, sold the defender to Parma.

It was at Parma, the city famous for its prosciutto, where Cannavaro's star began to shine.

Cannavaro also played a leading role in Parma winning a hatful of domestic and European trophies, including two Italian Cups (1999 and 2002) and the UEFA Cup in 1999.
