The store is Apple's second-largest, after the one on Regent Street in London.

The Boston store also features a glass spiral staircase from the ground floor to the third.

Apple Inc. is opening its first retail store in the heart of Boston at 815 Boylston Street.

The flagship Apple store was reviewed and approved by the Back Bay Architectural Commission and the Neighborhood Association of Back Bay in August 2006, Yessian said.

San Francisco based architect company Bohlin Cywinski Jackson designed the 22,116 square foot structure.

In the course of planning the store, Apple worked closely with the city of Boston and the Boston Redevelopment Authority to make the store fit into the neighborhood.

For example, the company planted natural grass on the buildingÃ¢â¬â¢s roof in an effort to provide some greenery in the urban environment.

In addition, the store is set up to collect and filter rainwater in order to help rebuild the Back BayÃ¢â¬â¢s water table, an issue that both Johnson and Menino said was important for the city.

And while the large amounts of glass and metal in the storeÃ¢â¬â¢s construction might present an air-conditioning challenge, Johnson also said that Apple worked hard to utilize natural light where possible to reduce heating costs in the winter.

Like most Apple stores, the Boylston Street location features copious amounts of glass and stainless steel, though Johnson also pointed out that the stone that makes up the floor is the same used in sidewalks in Florence, Italy.

The storeÃ¢â¬â¢s layout and size arenÃ¢â¬â¢t the only things that distinguish the Boylston Street location from most of its counterparts.

With a living green roof for eco-friendly insulation, the new Apple flagship in Boston is one of the most innovatively designed Apple stores in the world.
