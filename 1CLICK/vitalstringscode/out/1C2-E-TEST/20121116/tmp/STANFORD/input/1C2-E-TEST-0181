Many people believe that excessive amounts of tryptophan, an amino acid, in both the turkey and other carbohydrates, are what makes you tired after the huge Thanksgiving feast.

And yes, turkey does contain lots of tryptophan, but to really cause fatigue, tryptophan needs to be taken on a totally empty stomach and without any other amino acids or protein Ã¢â¬Å¡ not what you get at the Turkey Day feast.

Chicken, pork and cheese all have around the same or more tryptophan than turkey, but they donÃ¢â¬â¢t make you sleepy either.

So if it isnÃ¢â¬â¢t the tryptophan, what is it about turkey and the Thanksgiving feast that makes you so sleepy?.

Eating so very much food on Thanksgiving (and in general when a whole turkey is cooked Ã¢â¬Å¡ its very rare that a full turkey doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t come with at least mashed potatoes and stuffing) Ã¢â¬Å¡ is really what causes you to become tired.

Eating all that food is tiring, and then your body has to go to work on digesting it.

Another theory revolving around turkey dinner sleepiness is that people tend to consume a lot of carbohydrates along with turkey on Thanksgiving, which can increase insulin levels.

Tryptophan is so effective in inducing sleepiness, that it is sometimes used as a sleep aid to fight insomnia.

Many people think eating turkey on Thanksgiving makes them sleepy.

In this trial, and in general use of supplements, tryptophan is taken on an empty stomach to aid absorption.

Tryptophan is an amino acid that's found in a lot of foods, turkey being one of them.

For example, chicken, pork and cheese all have MORE tryptophan than even turkey does.

Well, in order for the tryptophan in turkey to truly make you feel sleepy, you'd need to eat just that alone on an empty stomach.

Because tryptophan can't be in competition with any other amino acids in order to have the sleepiness effect.

Another factor that attributes to that sleepy feeling after Thanksgiving dinner is fat intake.

Turkey is a great source of this essential acid, but it is not unique: many meats and other protein products pack comparable amounts.

Turkey and other protein-rich foods contain many amino acids, and tryptophan is the scarcest among them, Wurtman says.

"Paradoxically, what probably makes people sleepy after Thanksgiving dinner isÃ¢â¬Â¦dessert," he adds.

"Eating carbohydrates increases brain serotonin in spite of the fact that there is no tryptophan in carbohydrates.".
