Cheryl Maisel, a spokesperson for Reeves, has issued a statement denying the allegations that reads, Ã¢â¬ÅKaren SalaÃ¢â¬â¢s allegations are completely false and absurd.

Adds Paul Knell, ReevesÃ¢â¬â¢ Los Angeles business manager, Ã¢â¬ÅBefore you disparage my client and lend validity to this, thereÃ¢â¬â¢s clearly something wrong with someone who claims child support after all the kids have grown.

Though born in Beirut, Lebanon, Reeves lived in Toronto with his mother before moving to Hollywood in the late Ã¢â¬â¢80s.

Karen Sala, 46, filed a request in an Ontario court on Monday to force Reeves to provide a DNA sample in an effort to establish paternity.

Their marriage didn't last long, and Patricia packed up Keanu and his little sister, Kim, and relocated to New York City, where she married Paul Aaron, a Broadway and Hollywood director.

Relations: Mother: Patricia (costume designer); father: Samuel Nowlin Reeves (geologist); stepfathers:Paul Aaron (theater director), Robert Miller (promoter), Jack Bond (hair salon owner); siblings: Kim (horse breeder), Karina; ex-girlfriend: Jennifer Syme; companion: Amanda de Cadenet.

What I know is that one of the producers had the idea for me as the part and then went to my agents and then I got the script and read it and then they told the idea to Sam and Sam was like, "Uh, okay.

Sala said her children would like to know the truth about who their father is and she is launching the suit to seek "closure.".

In addition to the DNA test, Sala is seeking child support of $150,000 per month, retroactive to June 1988, as well as $3 million per month in spousal support retroactive to November 2006.

Reeves, 44, was born in Beirut, Lebanon, but lived in Toronto with his mother until he moved to Hollywood in the late '80s.

But Sala insisted that Reeves was aware that he might be the father of some or all of her children, noting that at least one of them bears a resemblance to him.

Sala said her relationship continued with Reeves throughout her teens and early 20s, saying Reeves has stayed in touch over the years and played a minor role in her children's upbringing.

Sala said she has a picture of Reeves when he was a teenager Ã¢â¬â though she was unable to produce it yesterday Ã¢â¬â and that she is hoping to get a photo from a friend of the two of them together more than 20 years ago.

Sala has what she describes as a sample of his handwriting, and said she has Reeves' phone number and current address in Los Angeles.

He did not have a normal childhood and had to move around a lot all over the world as a child.

Keanu was involved in a car accident himself and was sued for a hefty sum of $700,000. There are rumors today that Keanu has joined the group of scientologists along with Tom Cruise.

For the most of his life Keanu Reeves lived in hotels and rented apartments even after rising to stardom.

In 1999, Reeves was dating Jennifer Symes, who gave birth to a still born daughter and later in 2001, Symes lost her life in a car accident.

In spite of his high profile life and a great career, Keanu Reeves has been very unlucky in his personal life.

Sala said she has tried "privately" over the years to persuade Reeves to provide support...."Karen Sala's allegations are completely false and absurd.

Paul Knell, Reeves' Los Angeles business manager, questioned Sala's motives, noting that all four children are now adults.

"Before you disparage my client and lend validity to this, there's clearly something wrong with someone who claims child support after all the kids have grown.

"He (Reeves) is a high-profile person in Hollywood so people come out of the woodwork.
