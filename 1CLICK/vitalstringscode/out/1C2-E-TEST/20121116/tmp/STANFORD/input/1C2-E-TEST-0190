Since the moon rotates around the Earth and the Earth rotates around its own axis, the oceans are constantly in flux between high and low tide, which occur in intervals of about six hours and twelve minutes.

This is especially notable when the Earth, moon and sun line up together, which occurs twice each month -- during the full and new moons.

High tides occur at each of these gravitationally induced bulges with low tides occurring in between.

The tide-generating force is produced by the combination of (1) the gravitational attraction between Earth and the moon and sun, and (2) the rotation of the Earth-moon and Earth-sun systems.

At most shores throughout the world, two high tides and two low tides occur every lunar day, which is the time it takes for the moon to return to a point on the EarthÃ¢â¬âabout 24 hours and 50 minutes.

Thus, a typical seaport will alternate between high and low tides about every 6 hours. Some coasts, such as the shores along most of Antarctica, experience only one high tide and one low tide each lunar day.

The difference in height between high and low tides is called the range of tide.

Like the moon, the sun exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth but, because it is so far away, has a tide-raising force of only about half that of the moon.

The sum of the forces exerted by the moon and the sun creates a tide with two crests.

During the periods of new and full moonÃ¢â¬âwhen the sun, moon, and Earth are directly in lineÃ¢â¬âthe solar and lunar tides coincide.

A bulge in the water on the Earth's surface occurs on both the side facing the moon and the side away from the moon.

If all three are lined up in a straight line, the tides will have a higher tidal range. They are called spring tides. Spring tides occur twice a month, at full moon and at new moon.

But if the sun and moon are at right angles to one another, the tidal range will be lower. These tides are called neap tides. Neap tides occur twice a month, at first quarter and last quarter.

Spring tides have higher high tides and lower low tides whereas neap tides have lower high tides and higher low tides.

It is the combined effect of the sun and moon that creates spring and neap tides.

The actual timing of the tides themselves is as a result of both the rotation of the Earth and where exactly around the Earth the Moon sits at any given time.

Ocean tides can be described as the rise and fall of sea-water in a cyclical fashion.

Spring tide, having the maximum range, occurs during the full moon when the earth is between the moon and the sun, and new moon when the moon is between the earth and the sun.

Since the orbits of the Earth about the sun, and the moon about the Earth, are elliptical, tidal amplitudes change somewhat as a result of the varying EarthÃ¢â¬âsun and EarthÃ¢â¬âmoon distances.

Approximately twice a month, around new moon and full moon when the Sun, Moon and Earth form a line (a condition known as syzygy [8] ) the tidal force due to the sun reinforces that due to the Moon.

However, for a given location the relationship between lunar altitude and the time of high or low tide (the lunitidal interval ) is relatively constant and predictable, as is the time of high or low tide relative to other points on the same coast.

Although the sun has a much greater mass than the moon it is much further from the Earth and the gravitational attraction between the sun and the Earth is smaller than that between the moon and the Earth.

The tidal force acts toward the moon on the moonÃ¢â¬â¢s side of the Earth and away from the moon on the opposite side.

Tidal range varies during each month. Spring tides occur when the tidal range reaches a maximum and neap tides occur when the tidal range reaches a minimum in a given location.

Spring tides occur when the lunar high tide and the solar high tide occur at the same place at the same time.

At such times the lunar high tide and the solar high tide are added while the lunar low tide and solar low tide are also added, causing the tidal range to be at a maximum.

Neap tides occur when the lunar high tide and the solar low tide occur at the same place at the same time.

Spring tides occur at new moon and full moon.

At new moon, the Earth, sun, and moon are aligned so that the moon is located between the Earth and sun; at a full moon the Earth is located between the moon and sun.

Tidal heights and times of high and low tide are the sum of both the solar and lunar tides.

Tidal waves are formed by the gravitational forces of the earth, sun, and moon.

As the earth rotates, the tides go 'in' and 'out' (the earth moves but the bulge of water remains in line with the moon, giving the appearance that the tides are moving when it is in fact the earth that is moving).

When the earth, moon and sun are in line (during new and full moon), the bulges of water caused by the moon and sun occur in the same place on the earth's surface.

Every coast around the world experiences two high tide and low tides every day, separated by a period of approximately twelve and a half hours.

Once in a while, a record high tide is recorded, called a spring tide that is the highest of the high tides and they generally occur during a Full Moon and New Moon.

Sometimes, the high tides go very low and are called 'Neap Tides'.

There is something called gravity that can never be switched off somehow and it's Moon's gravitational pull along with Sun's, that causes tides to occur.

On a New Moon or a Full Moon, the Sun and the Moon get aligned in a straight line and their combined gravitational influence causes the highest tides ever, which are spring tides.

This creates a high tide on the side of the earth opposite the high tide caused by the direct pull of the moon.

Tides are most pronounced along the coastline of the oceans and in bays where tidal range (the difference in height between low tide and high tide) is increased due to the topography and other factors.

When the sun, moon, and the earth are lined up, the sun and moon are exerting their strongest force together and tidal ranges are at their maximum.

The gravitational pull of the moon and the sun creates tides on the earth.

This is known as spring tide (spring tides are not named from the season but from "spring forward") This occurs twice each month, when the moon is full and new.

During this time, any point on the earth's surface experiences two high tides and two low tides.
