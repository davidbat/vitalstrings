These complex interactions may result in climate change that is more rapid and on a larger scale than projected by current climate models.

Climate varies by region as a result of local differences in these interactions.

To more accurately portray the climatic character of an area, variations, patterns, and extremes must also be included. Thus, climate is the sum of all statistical weather information that helps describe a place or region.

Oceans have a major effect on climate, because water in the oceans holds a large amount of heat.".

Understanding and interpreting local weather data and understanding the relationship between weather and climate are important first steps to understanding larger-scale global climate changes.

Weather refers to the day-to-day state of the atmosphere, characterized by meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and winds.

On century-to-millennial scales, climate changes such as the Ã¢â¬Ålittle ice ageÃ¢â¬Â occur; and over the past approximately million years the global climate record is characterized by larger glacial-interglacial transitions, with multiple periodicities of roughly 20,000, 40,000, and 100,000 years, associated statistically with the effects of Earth-Sun orbital variations.

Climate is the long-term average or total of weather conditions at a given point.

A: Meteorologists describe the wind direction based on the direction from which it is blowing.

Weather changes from season to season, but the "sum" of the weather over time is climate.

Certainly we see climate changing rapidly now as the general warming of the earth has been characterized as "global climate change" meaning the general weather everywhere isn't going to "be like it used to" in the near future.

Climate is recorded weather over a period of time (like over a year).

Weather is the sun and the rain and the snow and the sleet and the hail and a sunny day. climate is what the weather isn't.

Weather is what the conditions of the atmosphere are over a short period of time and climate is the average weather over a very long period of time.

Weather means conditions such as air temperature, rain, snow, wind, or other atmospheric phenomena, on a particular day.

Climate describes what kind of weather a particular location is likely to have either seasonally or all the time; for example, Albuquerque has a dry climate, so you expect that it will rarely rain there, because a low amount of rain is the average condition there measured long enough to know what to expect.

Climate is statistics on weather, describing day to day patterns at a specific location for a certain amount of time, usually annually.

Therefore, Climate is the trends in weather patterns over an extended period of time.

Climate is defined as the various atmospheric conditions which include rainfall, temperature, wind, humidity and other meteorological elements etc., in a region over a long period of time.

Climate can be affected due to various factors which include human activities like burning fossil fuel, cutting down forest, local land features like mountains etc. climate change is one of the biggest problems facing the human beings.

Due to changes in climatic conditions the earth temperature is increasing day to day which causes global warming, depletion of ozone layer.

Changes in the weather can be caused due to differences in energy from the sun to earth so; the weather of the earth is different from one place to other.

Climate is the pattern of weather that a region experiences over a long period of time.

Climate is what you expect according to averages of atmospheric conditions collected over several years at a place.

Climate is recorded over a period of time where as weather is current condition.

Weather is the day-to-day state of atmosphere, whereas, the climate is constructed by the average weather conditions at a particular place for a long period of time.

Or, as one middle school student put it, "Climate helps you decide what clothes to buy, weather helps you decide what clothes to wear.".

Meteorologists often point out that "climate is what you expect and weather is what you get.".

Climate determines the animals that live in a certain region and what plants will grow there.

Climate helps farmers determine the best time to plant crops.

Climate of a region is usually determined by averaging the weather over a 30-year period.

Weather is the current atmospheric conditions, including temperature, rainfall, wind, and humidity at a given place.

Thus, climate is the sum of all statistical weather information that helps describe a place or region.

While we know how the weather changes from day to day, subtle climate changes are not as readily detectable. Weather patterns and climate types take similar elements into account, the most important of which are:.

Although weather and climate are different, they are very much interrelated. A change in one weather element often produces changes in the others - and in the region's climate.

Studying past climates and climate changes help us to better understand our current climate and what may happen in the future.

Long-term climate averages are the result of significant annual climate variability.

Paleoclimatologists study the earth's climate over millions of years using a variety of methods. Data for past climate changes can be gathered from sources beyond long-term weather observations.

Weather reflects short-term conditions of the atmosphere while climate is the average daily weather for an extended period of time at a certain location.

The oceans influence the worldÃ¢â¬â¢s climate by storing solar energy and distributing it around the planet through currents and atmospheric winds.

He also reportedly noted that climate is what we expect, whereas weather is what we get.

The old adage is that "climate is what you expect, weather is what you get," since day-to-day weather may depart significantly from average conditions.
