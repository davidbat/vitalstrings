Most quinoa sold commercially in North America has been processed to remove this coating.

This bitterness has beneficial effects during cultivation, as the plant is unpopular with birds and thus requires minimal protection.

Quinoa was of great nutritional importance in pre-Columbian Andean civilizations , secondary only to the potato , and was followed in importance by maize .

Quinoa has a light, fluffy texture when cooked, and its mild, slightly nutty flavor makes it an alternative to white rice or couscous .

The cooked germ looks like a tiny curl and should have a slight bite to it (like al dente pasta).

Quinoa can serve as a high-protein breakfast food mixed with honey , almonds , or berries ; it is also sold as a dry product, much like corn flakes .

Quinoa flour can be used in wheat-free and gluten-free baking.

[25] In fact, quinoa has a notably short germination period: Only 2â4 hours resting in a glass of clean water is enough to make it sprout and release gases, as opposed to, e.g., 12 hours with wheat.[ citation needed ] This process, besides its nutritional enhancements, softens the grains, making them suitable to be added to salads and other cold foods.

Most quinoa used in North America is imported from South America.

There have been attempts to lower the saponin content of quinoa through selective breeding to produce sweeter, more palatable varieties.

Quinoa has a light, fluffy texture when cooked, and its mild, slightly nutty flavor makes it an alternative to white rice or couscous.

The first step in preparing quinoa is to remove the saponins, a process that requires soaking the grain in water for a few hours, then changing the water and resoaking, or rinsing it in ample running water either in a fine strainer or in cheesecloth.

A common cooking method is to treat quinoa much like rice, bringing two cups of water to a boil with one cup of grain, covering at a low simmer and cooking for 14Ã¢â¬â18 minutes or until the germ separates from the seed.

It is also suited to vegetable pilafs, complementing bitter greens like kale.

Quinoa flour can be used in wheat-based and gluten-free baking.

Quinoa may be germinated in its raw form to boost its nutritional value.

Because of all these characteristics, quinoa is considered a possible crop in NASA's Controlled Ecological Life Support System for long-duration manned spaceflights (Schlick and Bubenheim 1993).

The saponins in quinoa can be mildly toxic, as can be the oxalic acid in the leaves of all the chenopodium family.

The risks associated with quinoa are minimal, provided it is properly prepared and leaves are not eaten to excess.

To clean, put the quinoa into a fine strainer and run water through it, or stir it in a bowl of cold water and pour it through a clean kitchen towel.

Native to Peru, quinoa (pronounced keen wah) was the mother grain of the Incas for centuries.

With superior protein and amino acid balance, quinoa is also high in calcium, phosphorus, iron, most B vitamins, zinc and lysine.

Quinoa seeds are coated with bitter saphonins, which must be removed before cooking.

Put the quinoa into a fine strainer, and run water through it until the water is clear and no longer sudsy.

Quinoa (pronounced Keen-wah) is an ancient food that is not yet well known in North America.

In South America the saponin which is removed from the quinoa is used as detergent for washing clothes and as an antiseptic to promote healing of skin injuries.

The quinoa seed is high in protein, calcium and iron, a relatively good source of vitamin E and several of the B vitamins.

The ancient Incas called quinoa the "mother grain" and revered it as sacred.

Unless these saponins are removed, the grain will taste quite bitter and is actually toxic.

Quinoa is gluten free and considered an ideal food for those prone to food allergies.
