DreamWorksÃ¢â¬â¢ lavish, CG-animated farce Ã¢â¬ÅPuss in BootsÃ¢â¬Â wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t the only feline-themed comedy nominated for the animated feature Oscar this year.

Santa Claus teams up with the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and Jack Frost to banish the Bogeyman.

Featured in their announcement is a diverse and ambitious slate of 13 new animated feature films, most of which will be featured in 3D.

Originally released by Walt Disney Pictures in 1995, Ã¢â¬ÅToy StoryÃ¢â¬Â was the first feature film from Pixar Animation Studios and director John Lasseter.

As has been the case recently, Disney will be releasing two major animated movies per year Ã¢â¬â one Pixar and one Disney.

Directed by: Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo).

Starting in 2009, however, weÃ¢â¬â¢ll be treated to 2 Pixar movies per year: 3D versions of Toy Story (in Ã¢â¬â¢09) and Toy Story 2 (in Ã¢â¬â¢10) as well as Up (in Ã¢â¬â¢09) and Toy Story 3 (in Ã¢â¬â¢10) and Newt and The Bear and the Bow (in Ã¢â¬â¢11).

In addition, Pixar also announced a new movie Ã¢â¬â Newt Ã¢â¬â for 2011.

The final animated short, La Luna (US, D: Enrico Casarosa) comes from Pixar studios and it plays like an illustrated children's book.

The second movie slated for 2011 will be an original called The Guardians.ÃÂ  Based on a yet to be released book by William Joyce, who also wrote "Meet the Robinsons" and "Rollie Pollie Ollie".ÃÂ  Guardians will unite some of the most beloved children characters including Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Jack Frost and Sandman against a Boogeyman type bad guy.ÃÂ .

The DreamWorks animated The Guardians is an adapted from the novel by William Joyce.ÃÂ  Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Jack Frost and the Tooth Fairy join forces to rid the world of a boogey-man villain. Ok, its not exactly a super hero movie, but it sounds like a great kids flick.ÃÂ  With the quality of DreamworkÃ¢â¬â¢s animated films, at least since Kung Fu Panda, steadily increasing, this could pan out to be a fun movie.ÃÂ  The film is directed by Peter Ramsey, and so far, Leonardo DiCaprio is slated to star.

The kids will enjoy Madagascar 3 but I suspect their parents will get sick of it after the 2nd viewing.

Based on the children's books by William Joyce, the film depicts The Guardians of Childhood - Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman and Jack Frost - teaming up to resist the Boogyman's reign of terror.

Furthermore, The Lorax is being directed by Chris Renaud, one of the directing team on Despicable Me, and Pixar alumnus Kyle Balda (he was directing animator on Toy Story 2, amongst other movies).

ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a CG animated film, and the first trailer for it has now been released, showing real promise.

Scrat used to be a fun supporting character, and, aware that he was the best thing in the original film, heÃ¢â¬â¢s got more and more important to the movies.

IÃ¢â¬â¢d like to see more of these, and IÃ¢â¬â¢d like DreamWorks to have a go at re-releasing both Antz and The Prince Of Egypt on the big screen, too.

Disney is releasing a trio of animated movies next year, and for the first time in a long, long time, itÃ¢â¬â¢s the one from Walt Disney Feature Animation itself thatÃ¢â¬â¢s sounding the most interesting.

Thus far, the film looks like it might just capture some of the spirit of the woefully-underappreciated Monster House, and if it can do that, ParaNorman might be one of the geeky sleeper hits of 2012.

Stop motion animation fans are being spoiled in 2012, not least because Halloween will see the arrival of Tim BurtonÃ¢â¬â¢s latest entry into the genre, Frankenweenie.

ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s little question that Pixar has been the groundbreaker where quality animated films of the past fifteen years or so has been concerned.

Chapman was one of the co-directors of DreamWorksÃ¢â¬â¢ maiden hand drawn animated film, The Prince Of Egypt, and this is her first full length feature since.

Rather, that for the first time in the history, the mainstream movie animation industry has at least eleven companies capable of producing a strong animated movie.

My suspicion is that 2013 is the year we see the very best of DreamWorks Animation again, as each of its three projects due out that year Ã¢â¬â The Croods, Turbo, Me And My Shadow Ã¢â¬â look really interesting.

Sanders is the man who co-directed the brilliant Lilo & Stitch and How To Train Your Dragon, and IÃ¢â¬â¢m pretty much happy to buy a ticket for any film he makes right now.

Rise Of The Guardians, though, looks like it might be something special, too, and it's always folly to write a DreamWorks project off.

ItÃ¢â¬â¢s the full length feature directorial debut for both of them, and their film unites the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus and the Sandman in a fight against the Bogeyman.

And while I was less keen on Hop, the firmÃ¢â¬â¢s second movie (IÃ¢â¬â¢m growing increasingly tired of animation/live action hybrids in general, truth be told, and I've left them all out of this list), IÃ¢â¬â¢m far, far more interested in the big screen adaptation of Dr SeussÃ¢â¬â¢ The Lorax.

ItÃ¢â¬â¢s one of SeussÃ¢â¬â¢ lesser known tales, certainly, but producer Chris Meladandri has form in this area, having produced the film of Dr SeussÃ¢â¬â¢ Horton Hears A Who! whilst at Fox.

Expect this animated. fantasy, drama to have you giggling away to yourself, especially since it features the voices of Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi, Andy Samberg and Cee-Lo Green.

However, if your child has seen the other films you can bet they are gonna annoy the hell outta you to see the last installment of Bella and Edward.

It looks like lots of fictional characters such as The Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, Jack Frost and the Sandman have to come together to ward off the Bogeyman.

With a star studded cast including Jude Law, Hugh Jackman, Alec Baldwin and Isla Fisher, it will be interesting to see how this film fairs in 2012.

The movie starts with Dorothy deciding to return to the land of Oz to help her friends once again.

The charming "La Luna," from Pixar director Enrico Casarosa , plays like a bedtime story, with a boy learning about moon maintenance from his father and grandfather.

William Joyce and Brandon Oldenburg 's "The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore " is a densely packed 15-minute dream, following the lifetime of a book lover who is swept by hurricane from his stoop to a magical library.

Canada offers two films in traditional 2-D animation - the standout is "Wild Life," which has the clearest narrative, featuring a British chap who naively moves to Canada in the early 1900s.

The serene mood created by "La Luna" and "Morris Lessmore" will be disrupted by some of the more stark visuals and themes of the other three films.

In case there's someone left on the planet who thinks animation is purely a medium for children, two of the five Academy Award-nominated animated shorts this year are meditations on death.

"The Oscar Nominated Short Films 2012: Animated" proves that it was still a good year for animation, even if audiences were underwhelmed by the mainstream feature fare.

The nominees - two from the United States, two from Canada and one from England - present a variety of entertaining styles.
