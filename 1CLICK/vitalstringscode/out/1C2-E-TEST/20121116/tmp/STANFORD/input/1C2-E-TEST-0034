[on winning the Best Actor Oscar] "If you grow up in the suburbs of anywhere, a dream like this seems kind of vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable.

Born in New Zealand, Russell has made his home in Australia since he was a small child.

I want to make movies that pierce people's hearts and touch them in some way, even if it's just for the night while they're in the cinema; in that moment, I want to bring actual tears to their eyes and goosebumps to their skin.

That's what motivates me, and it may sound strange but if you're not focused on the audience, why are you bothering to make a movie?".

One thing that I don't want to do is imply that I'm trying to make out it's somebody else's fault It's not, I know it's my fault, I've got to face up to it and deal with it.

Virtuosity, a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers.

Missing the Oscar nod this time around he didn't seem deterred and signed to do his first film with The Walt Disney Company, Mystery, Alaska (1999).

Russell's rock group is named 30 Odd Foot of Grunts.

They played their first US concert following Russell's success in Gladiator (2000) in Austin, Texas in August 2000.

He first co-starred with Denzel Washington in Virtuosity in 1995.

That same year, Crowe - who had been a musician since he was a teenager - formed the rock band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts with his old mates from Australia.

His beautifully realized, nuanced performance ranked as one of his best to date and earned the actor his third consecutive Best Actor Academy Award nomination, as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama.

During Crowe's acceptance of a BAFTA for Best Actor for "A Beautiful Mind," the BAFTA show's producer cut him off mid-speech and mid-poem, causing a fracas backstage when Crowe reportedly pinned the producer against the wall, threatening him and hurling obscenities.

He first co-starred with Denzel Washington in Virtuosity , and with Sharon Stone in The Quick and the Dead in 1995.

He went on to become a three-time Oscar nominee, winning the Academy Award as Best Actor in 2001 for Gladiator .

All three films were also nominated for best picture, and both Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind won the award.

Crowe's maternal grandfather, Stan Wemyss, was a cinematographer who, according to Crowe, produced the first film by New Zealander Geoff Murphy, and was also named an MBE for filming footage of World War II.

Crowe's maternal great-great grandmother was MÃÂori, and as a result Crowe is registered on the MÃÂori electoral roll in New Zealand; Crowe also has Welsh, Scottish, Norwegian, English and Irish ancestry.Two of Russell Crowe's cousins, Martin and Jeff Crowe are former New Zealand national cricket captains.

The producer of the Australian TV series Spyforce was his mother's godfather, and Crowe at age five or six was hired for a line of dialogue in one episode, opposite series star Jack Thompson, who years later played Crowe's father in The Sum of Us and who coincidentally had been educated at the same school which Crowe was to attend for two years: Sydney Boys High School.

Crowe wore his grandfather Stan Wemyss's Member of the Order of the British Empire medal to the ceremony.

Crowe received three consecutive best actor Oscar nominations for The Insider, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind.

Crowe recalled that "it was something to do with some recording picked up by a French policewoman, I think, in either Libya or Algiers...it was about taking iconographic Americans out of the picture as a sort of cultural-destabilization plan".

In the 2000s, he has been nominated for three Oscars, and in 2000, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his starring role in the film Gladiator.

The irony being that he is a New Zealand born Australian, who has often made clear his dislike of being in Hollywood.

After initial success in Australia, Crowe began acting in American films. He first co-starred with Denzel Washington in Virtuosity in 1995.

All three films were also nominated for best picture, and both Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind won the award. Within the six year stretch from 1997-2003, he also starred in two other best picture nominees, L.A. Confidential and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World , though he was nominated for neither.

"All that stuff, this public persona of me - let's call him 'the wild man' - that is not helpful.

It doesn't make me more of a box office draw. It's the quality of my work that makes people want to go to my films.".

Virtuosity (1995), starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. Virtuosity (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers.
