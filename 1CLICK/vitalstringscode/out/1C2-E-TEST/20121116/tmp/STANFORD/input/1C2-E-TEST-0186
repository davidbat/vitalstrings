The anteater can cover its tongue in a sticky saliva , allowing it to trap ants, and the tongue can be extended and withdrawn up to 150 times per minute.

Giant anteaters have no teeth but a specialized tongue that allows them to eat up to 30,000 ants and termites each day.

These animals are perfectly designed to feed on these little critters, which is great because ants are a very reliable food source. The anteater's narrow tongue is about 2 feet (60 centimeters) long and looks like a strand of spaghetti with teeny, backward-pointing spines that are covered in sticky saliva when the animal is feeding.

This long tongue darts inside an ant mound up to 150 times per minute, picking up the worker ants. The anteater will only feed at one mound for about a minute before moving on.

Aside from thinking theyÃ¢â¬â¢re delicious, anteaters have a good reason for eating ants and other critters: With their long tongues (up to two feet big in Giant Anteaters!) and their gooey saliva, anteaters are made for tearing into nests or mounds with their claws and then slurping up all of the bugs they can find!.

And since anteaters like eating ants and termite so much, theyÃ¢â¬â¢re careful not to destroy a nest when they eat from it.Ã¢â¬âThat way, they can come back and it from it again another time!.
