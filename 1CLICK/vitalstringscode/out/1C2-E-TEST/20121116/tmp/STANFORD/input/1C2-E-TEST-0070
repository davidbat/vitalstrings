PHOENIX (AP) - Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners singled to lead off Tuesday night's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks for the 2,500th hit of his major league career.

Ichiro began playing in the Major Leagues with the Seattle Mariners in 2001 when he was 27.

Ichiro was the first Japanese position player in the Major League (the Japanese players that preceded him were pitchers).

He has the power to hit home runsâhe usually hits more of them than anyone in batting practiceâbut doesn't hit many in games.

Thanks in part to Ichiro the Mariners were one of the few Major League Teams to make a profit in 2001.

In 2001, Ichiro was named Most Valuable Player in the American League.

Ichiro also was voted Rookie of the Year, making him only the second player to receive the MVP and Rookie of the Year awards in the same year and the first player since Jackie Robinson to lead the league in hitting and stolen bases.

In 2001, Ichiro lead the league in batting average (.350), hits (242, the most since 1930), stolen bases (56), multi hit games (75).

In 2002, Ichiro was 2nd in number of hits in the Major League and 4th in the American League in batting average and stolen bases.

Ichiro Sets the Single Season Hit in 2004.

In 2004, Ichiro broke the single season Major League hit record, with 262 hits, breaking the the record of 257 hits, set by George Sisler in 1920.

Ichiro finished the 2004 season with a .372 batting average, enough to earn him his second American League batting crown.

In 2008, Ichiro became the first player to get 200 hits in eight consecutive seasons since Willie Keeler achieved the feat between 1894 to 1901.

Ichiro had 1,278 hits in nine season in Japan and 1,808 hits in nine season in the Major League.

In May and June 2009, Ichiro pulled off a 27 game hitting streak, a Mariner record.

In 1994, Ichiro became the first player in Japanese baseball to reach the 200 hit mark with 210 hits, which he did in a 130 game season in Japan compared to 162 in the Majors.

In 2010, Ichiro became the first Major League player to hit 200 hits or more in 10 straight seasons.

He had his major league record streak of consecutive 200-hit seasons snapped at 10.

In his first year with the Seattle Mariners in 2001 he was voted the Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year in the American League. As of 2008 he won eight gold gloves, had 200 hits and made All-Star appearances in all eight of his Major League seasons, some years receiving more votes from fans than any other player in the All Star balloting.

In his first full season (1994), as scrawny kid with only a trace for facial hair, Ichiro hit for the highest average ever (.385) in the history of the Pacific League and set a Japan League record by hitting 210 hits in 130 games and was voted MVP. He was the first Japanese player to hit more 200 hits, For the effort his salary was increased from about $80,000 a year to $800,000 a year.

During his eight years in the Japan League he had a batting average of .353 and a stolen base average of 28 a year.

Ichiro led the Blue Wave to two pennant titles and one Japan Series championship.

Ichiroâs single season hit record of 210 still stands.

When Ichiro joined his junior high school baseball team, his father told the coach, "No matter how good Ichiro is, don't ever praise him.

When he was ready to enter high school, Ichiro was selected by a school with a prestigious baseball program, Nagoya 's Aikodai Meiden Koukou.

He responded by setting a Japanese single-season record with 210 hits in 130 games for a then-Pacific League record .385 batting average and won the first of a record seven consecutive batting titles.

At age seven, Ichiro joined his first baseball team and asked his father, Nobuyuki, to teach him to be a better player.

In 1995 , Ichiro led the Blue Wave to their first Pacific League pennant in 12 years.

The following year, with Ichiro winning his third straight MVP award, the team defeated the Central League champion Yomiuri Giants in the Japan Series .

In 2000, Ichiro was still a year away from being eligible for free agency, but the Blue Wave were no longer among Japan's best teams and would probably not be able to afford to keep him.

After the 2000 season, in which Ichiro posted his highest batting average (.387), a Pacific League record, Seattle won a bidding war among Major League teams for the rights to negotiate with him on a contract.

Ichiro signed a three-year, $14 million contract with the Mariners and became the first Japanese-born everyday position player in the Major Leagues.

In his nine seasons in Japan, Ichiro was a career .353 batter and, in addition to his hitting achievements, won seven Gold Glove Awards.

Ichiro's move to the United States was viewed with great interest because he was the first Japanese position player to play regularly for a Major League Baseball team.

Up until that point, only pitchers from Japan had been playing in the United States and, in the same way that many Japanese teams had considered the 18-year-old Ichiro too small to draft in 1992, many in the US believed he was too frail to succeed against Major League pitching or endure the longer 162-game season.

Not only did he prove he belonged, Ichiro had a remarkable 2001 season , accumulating 242 hits (the most by any player since 1930 ) and leading the league with a .350 batting average and 56 stolen bases.

Aided by Major League Baseball's decision to allow All-Star voting in Japan, Ichiro was the first rookie to lead all players in voting for the All-Star Game .

At season's end, he won the American League Most Valuable Player and the Rookie of the Year awards, becoming only the second player in MLB history (after Fred Lynn ) to receive both honors in the same season.

Ichiro also has been a four-time Gold Glove winner between 2001 and 2004.

Continuing the custom he began in Japan, he uses his given name on the back of his uniform, instead of his surname , becoming the first player in Major League Baseball to do so since Vida Blue .

Ichiro set a number of Major League records during the 2004 season :.

October 1 : Ichiro got his 258th and 259th hits, breaking the record set by George Sisler with the St. Louis Browns in 1920 .

Following his final season at Meiden, Ichiro was drafted by the Orix Blue Wave of Japan's Pacific League in November 1991.

Ichiro also joined Pete Rose and Ty Cobb as the only players to have nine career 200-hit seasons overall, though Rose took 15 seasons to reach the milestone, while Cobb needed 20.

Ichiro also has more hits over a nine-year period than anyone in MLB history.

2011: Ichiro would set the record with 11 career 200-hit seasons.

He would also set the Mariner career hits record, currently held by Edgar Martinez with 2,247.

2014: Ichiro would set the record with 14 career 200-hit seasons.

During the 1994 season, when Ichiro was one of four Orix players named Suzuki, Blue Wave manager Akira Ogi had him replace the last name on his jersey to his first name, a publicity stunt to promote the rising star.

Ichiro again led the league with a .342 batting average, and had career highs of 25 home runs and 49 steals.

Ichiro led the Pacific League for the third straight season with a .356 average, won his third straight MVP award, and he led the Blue Wave to the Japan Series title, beating the Central League champion Yomiuri Giants.

Besides playing in his fourth consecutive all-star game, Ichiro's .345 average led the Pacific League for fourth straight season, he won his fourth consecutive Gold Glove award, and he set an NPB record of 216 consecutive plate appearances without a strikeout.

The model of consistency, Ichiro won his fifth straight Gold Glove and batting crown (hitting .358), and played in his fifth all-star game.

After returning to Japan, Ichiro won his sixth batting title (hitting .356) and sixth Gold Glove, and his .412 on-base percentage led the Pacific League for the fourth time.

In his seventh and final full major league season in Japan, Ichiro's .387 batting average was not only his career best, but also set the Japanese record with seven straight Pacific League batting titles.

Through the posting system, the Seattle Mariners won the right to negotiate with him, and on November 18, 2000, the M's signed him to a three-year, $14 million contract, making Ichiro the first-ever Japanese position player to sign with a Major League club.

Ichiro's American debut with the 2001 Seattle Mariners was not only one of the greatest seasons any player has ever recorded, but it was also one of the most-watched, as the Japanese media sensation quickly gained superstardom in the U.S. The leadoff hitter's .350 batting average led the majors, as did his 242 hits (a rookie record, and the most by any player in 71 years), as well as his 56 stolen bases.

Instead, he won both the American League's Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year awards, the only player besides Fred Lynn to do so.

With his .312 batting average and 212 hits, he became the third player with 200 hits in his first three seasons.

Ichiro's 262 hits set the all-time Major League single-season hits record, breaking George Sisler's 84-year-old record of 257.

He became the first player in MLB history to reach 200 hits in each of his four seasons; his 922 hits during that period were more than anyone during any four-year period.

Back in Seattle, Ichiro led the majors with 224 hits, extending his 200-hit season streak to six, joining Wade Boggs and Wee Willie Keeler as the only players ever to do so.

Ichiro racked up a league-leading 238 hits, becoming only one of eight players to collect 200 hits in seven career seasons, and the only player besides Wee Willie Keeler to do it in consecutive years (Keeler had eight).

In March, Ichiro and Team Japan won their second gold medal in the second-ever World Baseball Classic.

Ichiro would finish the 2004 season with a record 262 hits, giving him the single-season records for both the United States and Japanese baseball.

That allowed Ichiro to become the first player to collect 200 hits per season in each of his first five years in the Major Leagues.

Ichiro hit a career-high 15 home runs.

In May and June, Ichiro hit in 25 consecutive games, breaking the previous Seattle Mariners record set by Joey Cora in 1997.

However, in July Ichiro signed a five-year contract extension with Seattle.

Ichiro went hitless in the following afternoon's game.

It was also his first season not playing in the All-Star game, as well as his first season not winning a Golden Glove.

He set a Japanese single-season record with 210 hits, the first player ever to top 200 hits in a single season.

Ichiro's then-Pacific League record .385 batting average won the young outfielder the first of a record seven consecutive batting titles.

At age seven, Ichiro joined his first baseball team and asked his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki (Suzuki Nobuyuki), to teach him to be a better player.

Ichiro also hit 13 home runs and had 29 stolen bases , helping him to earn his first of three straight Pacific League MVP (Most Valuable Player) awards.

The following year, with Ichiro winning his third straight MVP award, the team defeated the Central League champion, Yomiuri Giants , in the Japan Series.

Following the 1996 season, playing in an exhibition series against a visiting team of Major League All-Stars kindled Ichiro's desire to travel to the United States to play in the Major Leagues.

In 2000, Ichiro was still a year away from being eligible for free agency, but the Blue Wave were no longer among Japan's best teams.

With a .350 batting average and 56 stolen bases, Ichiro was the first player to lead his league in both categories since Jackie Robinson in 1949.

Aided by Major League Baseball's decision to allow All-Star voting in Japan, Ichiro was the first rookie to lead all players in voting for the All-Star Game .
