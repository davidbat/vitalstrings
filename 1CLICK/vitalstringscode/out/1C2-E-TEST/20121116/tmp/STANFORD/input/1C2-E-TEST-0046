[76] Choosing not to seek re-election, Hayes looked forward to retiring from politics in 1872.

[161] Hayes awarded the disputed land in the Gran Chaco region to Paraguay, and the Paraguayans honored him by renaming a city ( Villa Hayes ) and a department ( Presidente Hayes ) in his honor.

[161] Hayes was also perturbed over the plans of Ferdinand de Lesseps , the builder of the Suez Canal , to construct a canal across the Isthmus of Panama , which was then owned by Colombia .

[162] Concerned about a repetition of French adventurism in Mexico , Hayes interpreted the Monroe Doctrine firmly.

[163] In a message to Congress, Hayes explained his opinion on the canal: "The policy of this country is a canal under American controlÃÂ ...

[164] The situation calmed as DÃÂ­az and Hayes agreed to jointly pursue bandits and Hayes agreed not to allow Mexican revolutionaries to raise armies in the United States.

[165] The violence along the border decreased, and in 1880 Hayes revoked the order allowing pursuit into Mexico.

[168] Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation.

[171] Hayes believed that his policies would lead to self-sufficiency and peace between Indians and whites.

[173] Hayes and Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations.

Hayes also became involved in resolving the removal of the Ponca tribe from Nebraska to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma ) because of a misunderstanding during the Grant Administration.

[178] The tribe's problems came to Hayes's attention after their chief, Standing Bear , filed a lawsuit to contest Schurz's demand that they stay in Indian Territory.

Overruling Schurz, Hayes set up a commission in 1880 that ruled Ponca were free to return to Nebraska or stay on their reservation in Indian Territory.

Hayes and his wife, Lucy , were known for their policy of keeping an alcohol-free White House, giving rise to her nickname "Lemonade Lucy." [180] The first reception at the Hayes White House included wine .

[181] However, Hayes was dismayed at drunken behavior at receptions hosted by ambassadors around Washington, leading him to follow his wife's temperance leanings.

Critics charged Hayes with parsimony, but Hayes spent more money (which came out of his personal budget) after the ban, ordering that any savings from eliminating alcohol be used on more lavish entertainment.

Hayes moved to Cincinnati in 1850, and opened a law office with John W. Herron, a lawyer from Chillicothe .

Hayes's father, a Vermont storekeeper, took the family to Ohio in 1817 but died ten weeks before his son's birth.

Considering that the two sides might be irreconcilable, he suggested that the Union "[l]et them go." [37] Although Ohio had voted for Lincoln in 1860, the Cincinnati voters turned against the Republican party after secession, and the Democrats and Know-Nothings combined to sweep the city elections in April 1861, ejecting Hayes from the city solicitor's office.

[38] After the Confederates had fired on Fort Sumter , Hayes resolved his doubts and joined a volunteer company composed of his Literary Society friends.

After a month of training, Hayes and the 23rd Ohio set out for western Virginia in July 1861 as a part of the Kanawha Division .

[41] They passed the next few months out of contact with the enemy until September, when the regiment encountered Confederates at Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia and drove them back.

[42] In November, Hayes was promoted to lieutenant colonel (Matthews having been promoted to colonel of another regiment) and led his troops deeper into western Virginia, where they entered winter quarters.

[44] That September, Hayes's regiment was called east to reinforce General John Pope 's Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run .

[45] Although Hayes and his troops did not arrive in time for the battle, they joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , which was advancing into Maryland .

[46] Hayes led a charge against an entrenched position and was shot through his left arm, fracturing the bone.

[47] The regiment continued on to Antietam , but Hayes was out of action for the rest of the campaign.

[50] Hayes saw little action until July 1863, when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan 's cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island .

[53] On May 9, they engaged Confederate troops at Cloyd's Mountain , where Hayes and his men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field.

Hayes and his brigade moved to the Shenandoah Valley for the Valley Campaigns of 1864 .

[54] Hayes thought that Hunter lacked aggression, writing in a letter home that "General Crook would have taken Lynchburg." [54] Before the army could make another attempt, Confederate General Jubal Early 's raid into Maryland forced their recall to the north.

Hayes's troops fended off a Confederate assault at Berryville and advanced to Opequon Creek , where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south.

[58] Hayes's conduct drew the attention of his superiors, with Ulysses S. Grant later writing of Hayes that "[h]is conduct on the field was marked by conspicuous gallantry as well as the display of qualities of a higher order than that of mere personal daring." [59].
