Dr.ÃÂ Dre also produced " How We Do ", a 2005 hit single from rapper The Game from his album The Documentary.

Dr.ÃÂ Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000 , a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording.

Current collaborator Mike Elizondo , when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians.

Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians.

Besides working on his own material, Dr.ÃÂ Dre produced Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle , which became the first debut album for an artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 album charts.

In 2011, his final solo studio album, Detox, is set to be released following much delay and speculation. Early life The first child of Verna and Theodore Young, Dr. Dre was born as AndrÃ© Romelle Young on February 18, 1965.

Young's middle name, "Romelle", came from Theodore Young's unsigned, amateur R&B singing group The Romells.

Thus, he became a DJ in the club, initially under the name "Dr. J" based on the nickname for Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player.

So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dr. Dre was on the drum machine".[81] Current collaborator Mike Elizondo, when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians.

"My greatest talent," Dre says, "is knowing exactly what I want to hear."[72] Although Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr. Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators.[83] It should be noted that Dr. Dre's prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer. It is also widely acknowledged that most of Dr. Dre's raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs.

The release will be his first since 1999's '2001' album and Dre has indicated it will be his last full album.

Dr.ÃÂ Dre also produced "How We Do", a 2005 hit single from rapper The Game from his album The Documentary.

In 2001 he told Time magazine, "I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it.

Dr.ÃÂ Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies.

To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.ÃÂ Dre.

Current collaborator Mike Elizondo, when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians.

This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book Angry Blonde, stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr.ÃÂ Dre was out of the studio but later programmed the song's beat after returning.

Although Young studies piano and musical theory, he serves as more of a conductor than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine has noted:.

Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians.

Thus, he became a DJ in the club, initially under the name "Dr. J", based on the nickname of Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player.

He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru under the independent Kru-Cut Records in 1984.

Dr.ÃÂ Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam.

After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother's house.

He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.

Propelled by the hit "Fuck tha Police", the group's first full album Straight Outta Compton became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours.

Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content.

For that year, Billboard magazine also ranked Dr.ÃÂ Dre as the eighth best-selling musical artist, The Chronic as the sixth best-selling album, and "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" as the 11th best-selling single.

Besides working on his own material, Dr.ÃÂ Dre produced Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle, which became the first debut album for an artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 album charts.

He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song "Natural Born Killaz" in 1995.

In 1995, just as Death Row Records was signing rapper 2Pac and positioning him as their major star, Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control.

The album featured numerous collaborators, including Devin the Dude, Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Eminem.
