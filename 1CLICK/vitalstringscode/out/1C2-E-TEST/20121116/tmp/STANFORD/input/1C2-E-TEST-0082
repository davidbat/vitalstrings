Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher holds the record for the most championships, while his 91 wins, [3] 155 podium finishes and 68 pole positions are also records.

This has not always been the case, and in the earlier history of Formula One many races took place outside the world championship.

The first Formula One World Championship was won by Italian Giuseppe Farina in his Alfa Romeo in 1950 , barely defeating his Argentine teammate Juan Manuel Fangio .

Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to compete regularly, he was never able to win the World Championship, and is now widely considered to be the greatest driver never to have won the title.

[3] [4] Fangio, however, is remembered for dominating Formula One's first decade and has long been considered the "grand master" of Formula One.

Michael Schumacher holds the record for having won the most Drivers' Championships (seven) and Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen).

The number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years.

The grands prix, some of which have a history that predates the Formula One World Championship, are not always held on the same circuit every year.

Australian Jack Brabham , World Champion in 1959 , 1960 and 1966 , soon proved the new design's superiority.

However, when Colin Chapman entered F1 as a chassis designer and later founder of Team Lotus , British racing green came to dominate the field for the next decade.

Between Jim Clark , Jackie Stewart , John Surtees , Jack Brabham, Graham Hill , and Denny Hulme , British teams and Commonwealth drivers won twelve world championships between 1962 and 1973.

A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a World Championship before the war, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship was not formalised until 1947.

On the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s, with Brabham also being competitive in the early part of the 1980s, winning two drivers' championships with Nelson Piquet .

Drivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton) and Ferrari, dubbed the "Big Four", have won every World Championship from 1984 to the present day.

Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won an unprecedented five consecutive driversÃ¢â¬â¢ championships and six consecutive constructorsÃ¢â¬â¢ championships between 1999 and 2004.

Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91), wins in a season (13 of 18), and most drivers' championships (7).

Of course if you look at the numbers, there is little doubt that Michael Schumacher should be voted best Formula 1 driver ever.

And yet, some argue that Schumacher never showed the class of Juan Manuel Fangio, who won five World Championships in the fifties.

Fangio won the title in 1951 ; Alberto Ascari won the next two championships in Ferrari cars, but Fangio then won four consecutive championships, 1954 through 1957 .

Though Stirling Moss was able to compete with him regularly, Fangio is remembered for dominating Formula One's first decade.

The first British World Champion was Mike Hawthorn, who drove a Ferrari to the title in 1958 ; however, when Colin Chapman entered F1 as a chassis designer and later founder of Lotus , British racing green came to dominate the field for the next decade.

Between Jim Clark , Jackie Stewart , Jack Brabham , Graham Hill , and Denny Hulme , British teams and commonwealth drivers won twelve world championships between 1962 and 1973 .

Williams were the most successful team during the mid 1990s with Nigel Mansell , Alain Prost , Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve driving their Renault powered cars to world championships, although Michael Schumacher did win two championships with Benetton during this period.

Since 1984 , three teams have dominated the championships: McLaren , Williams , and Ferrari , who have provided the vehicles for all but two of the World Champions for that period.

The sport of grand prix racingÃÂ began before the first World War and the first race to take the name "grand prix" was a race in Pau in 1901.

The sport is commonly thought to have been founded in 1950, but that is a myth.ÃÂ The 1950 season was the beginning of the FIA world championship, but there were many years of competition before that.

During his short 5 year stint in F1, Farina earned 1 World Championship, 5 Grand Prix wins, 20 podium finishes and 5 pole positions.ÃÂ  Due to the fact that he was the first World Champion and in the times that he raced, this Italian driver earns a deserved spot among the top ten.
