Euro 2012: Can Cristiano Ronaldo Do a Maradona for Portugal?.

Going into Euro 2012, the team carries relatively light hopes.

Portugal does have one diamond, though: Ronaldo, now in his pomp at Real Madrid, is far and away EuropeÃ¢â¬â¢s best player.

His goals were crucial to Portugal qualifying for Euro 2012, and the teamÃ¢â¬â¢s fortunes rest mostly on his powerful shoulders.

But while Portugal has Ronaldo, anything is possible.

England is not the only team going into Euro 2012 with the advantage of low expectations: consider Portugal.

Ronaldo had several chances for Portugal in the semifinals against Spain, but he sent three shots over the bar.

We'll wait and see who we get in the semi-finals," said Ronaldo, who headed in the winner on Thursday to beat Czech Republic 1-0 to reach the European Championship semi-finals.

Striker Cristiano Ronaldo scored in the 79th minute, sending Portugal to a 1-0 victory over the Czech Republic Thursday during the quarter-final match at the European championship in Warsaw.

If Portugal is to contend against either Spain or France, it will need Ronaldo to work his magic.

Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to be on the line-up when Portugal faces Poland, this Wednesday.

His critics say this is the main reason that Ronaldo, like Messi, cannot be compared to past greats like Pele, Diego Maradona or Eusebio, all of whom are remembered for stunning tournament performances.
