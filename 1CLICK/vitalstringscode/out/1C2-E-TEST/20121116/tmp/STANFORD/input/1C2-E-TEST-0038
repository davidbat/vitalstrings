Cameron was the founder and CEO of Digital Domain , a visual effects production and technology company.

The investigation was featured in the TV documentary special Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron, which premiered on April 8 on the National Geographic Channel .

During the early 1980s, Cameron wrote three screenplays simultaneously: The Terminator, Aliens , and the first draft of Rambo: First Blood Part II .

While Cameron continued with The Terminator and Aliens, Sylvester Stallone eventually took over the script of Rambo: First Blood Part II , creating a final draft which differed radically from Cameron's initial version.

Cameron next began the sequel to Alien , the 1979 film by Ridley Scott .

Cameron named the sequel Aliens, and again cast Sigourney Weaver in the iconic role of Ellen Ripley .

According to Cameron, the crew on Aliens was hostile to him, regarding him as a poor substitute for Ridley Scott.

Cameron sought to show them The Terminator but the majority of the crew refused to watch it and remained skeptical of his direction throughout production.

Despite this and other off-screen problems (such as clashing with an uncooperative camera man and having to replace one of the lead actors Ã¢â¬â Michael Biehn of Terminator took James Remar 's place as Corporal Hicks), Aliens became a box office success, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Weaver, Best Art Direction , Best Film Editing , Best Original Score , Best Sound , and won awards for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects .

In addition, the film and its lead actress made the cover of TIME magazine as a result of its numerous and extensive scenes of women in combat - these were almost without precedent and expressed the feminist theme of the film very strongly.

Finally, Cameron found a company called Hemdale Pictures , which was willing to let him direct.

Cameron had originally wanted to incorporate this advanced-model Terminator into the first film, but the special effects at the time were not advanced enough.

It won four Academy Awards : Best Makeup , Best Sound , Best Sound Effects Editing , and Best Visual Effects .

It was released in 1996 and was a mini-sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

Cameron's budget for the film reached about $200ÃÂ million, making it the most expensive movie ever made at the time.

Titanic became the highest-grossing film ever made, until Cameron's 2009 film Avatar .

It won 11 Oscars (also record-tying with Ben-Hur and later The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ), including Best Picture , Best Film Editing , Best Sound , Best Sound Effects Editing , Best Visual Effects , Best Original Song , Best Original Dramatic Score , and the Best Director award for Cameron.

"Avatar" eclipsed "Titanic" at the movie box office, domestically and internationally and is the highest grossing movie of all time.

"Avatar Movie " - Oscar winning director James Cameron's return to the big screen with "Avatar Movie," was twelve years in the making.

More than ten years in the making, "Avatar" marks Cameron's return to feature directing since helming 1997's Titanic, the highest grossing film of all time and winner of eleven Oscars including Best Picture.

He directed Arnold Schwarzenegger in his career-making role in The Terminator (1984) and its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).

Cameron also directed Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (1986) and Ed Harris in The Abyss (1989).

The documentary, named "The Lost Tomb of Jesus," was broadcast on the Discovery Channel in March of that year.

The original historic event was also marked by the television documentary, "Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron" (National Geographic Channel, 2012), in which expert historians, architects, engineers and Cameron himself, provided the ultimate examination of the ship's sinking, aided by recent technological advancements.

Reteaming with Arnold Schwarzenegger, he proved himself worth the risk with the back-to-back blockbusters, "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991) and "True Lies" (1994).

It was nominated for four technical Academy Awards and won for Best Visual Effects, in which some of the first CGI special effects in the form of a water tentacle were utilized.

Described by Cameron as a "violent movie about world peace," the film earned over $200 million in domestic box office and won Oscar Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Makeup and Best Sound Effects Editing.

Meanwhile, the film received 14 Academy Award nominations, matching a record held only by "All About Eve" (1950), and went on to tie "Ben-Hur" (1959) with 11 wins, including Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director.

Returning to the inspiration that made him one of the most celebrated directors of his era, Cameron directed his second documentary, "Ghosts of the Abyss" (2003), a 3-D IMAX journey to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to find the final resting place of the ill-fated Titanic.

Four of his films have made it to the IMDb top 250 list: The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Aliens (1986) and Avatar (2009).

Until Avatar (2009), Cameron's previous movie Titanic (1997) was the highest grossing movie of all time for 12 years (also not adjusted for inflation).

Directed three of the American Film Institute's 100 Most Heart Pounding Movies: Titanic (1997) at #25, The Terminator (1984) at #42 and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) at #77.

First director to film both a $100 million ( Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)) and a $200 million ( Titanic (1997)) movie.

At one desk, he was writing the script to The Terminator (1984), on another, he was finishing the script to Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and on the third, he was writing Aliens (1986).

See: The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), True Lies (1994), and Strange Days (1995).

The titles of his two current theatrical documentaries contain the titles of two of his previous films; the title of his documentary Ghosts of the Abyss (2003) contains the title of his previous film The Abyss (1989), and the title of his other documentary Aliens of the Deep (2005) contains the title of another one of his previous films, Aliens (1986).

Determined to get into directing, Cameron worked on another sci-fi film with a symbolic name, "Galaxy of Terror".

After "The Terminator's" success, Cameron directed "Aliens" and began production in 1985 in England.

The film became one of the highest grossing ÃâR' rated films and also won Oscars for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound.

With its breakneck action sequences, Cameron's sequel to Alien bests the original -- no small achievement.

True Lies (1994): Cameron's version of comedy still features spies, explosions, terrorists, and Jamie Lee Curtis doing a bump and grind.

Strange Days (1995): Cameron wrote the gritty cyberpunk flick directed by ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow, which presages Avatar as a sci-fi head trip about a machine that allows people to replay the experiences of others.

Despite this and other off-screen problems (such as clashing with an uncooperative camera man and having to replace one of the lead actors - Michael Biehn of Terminator took James Remar's place as Corporal Hicks), Aliens became a box office success, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Weaver, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound, and won awards for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects.
