Electronic Ink is an international business system Design consultancy dedicated to improving the way people interact with technology, environments and one another.

Its low-level power consumption is also making E Ink popular in cell phones and watches.

Inside these "microcapsules" float even tinier black and white particles; the black particles are negatively charged while the white particles are positively charged.

For instance, when a negative electric field is applied, the white particles rise to the top, while the black particles are pulled to the bottom of the spheres.

BENEFITS: The E-Ink technology is reflective, so it uses almost no power; even large displays will use a minimum amount of electricity.

*The microcapsule of this electronic ink display is "VizplexÃ¢âÂ¢ Imaging Film" by E-Ink Corporation.

In addition, it required a very low level of power while having a virtually unlimited size of display.

Applying a negative electrical field causes the white particles to come to the surface.

Conversely, applying a positive electrical field causes the black particles to come to the surface.

E Ink displays are especially popular due to their resemblance to printed paper.

There are also white particles in between (they do not move) and so white can be displayed.

To form an E Ink electronic display, the ink is printed onto a sheet of plastic film that is laminated to a layer of circuitry.

These microcapsules are suspended in a liquid "carrier medium" allowing them to be printed using existing screen printing processes onto virtually any surface, including glass, plastic, fabric and even paper.

Ultimately electronic ink will permit most any surface to become a display, bringing information out of the confines of traditional devices and into the world around us.

Revolutionary in concept, electronic ink is a fusion of chemistry, physics and electronics to create this new material.

In one incarnation, each microcapsule contains positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid.

To form a smart ink display, the ink is coated onto a sheet of plastic film that is laminated to a layer of circuitry.

The circuitry forms a pattern of pixels that can then be controlled by a display driver.

The microcapsules are suspended in a liquid "carrier medium" allowing them to be coated using existing coating processes.

The final laminate can be applied onto virtually any surface, including glass, plastic, fabric and even paper.

E Ink is the creator of electronic ink Ã¢â¬â the optical component of a film used in Electronic Paper Displays.

When a positive or negative electric field is applied, corresponding particles move to the top of the microcapsule where they become visible to the user.

Because the white particles are positively charged and the black particles are negatively charged, they can be easily separated by applying a charge from behind the screen with an electrode.

Although Seiko and E Ink demonstrated the prototype together in 2005 , it didnÃ¢â¬â¢t become a commercial reality until 2006, and even then rumor has it that less than 500 were ever made, all priced at 262,500 yen Ã¢â¬â the modern equivalent of $2,700.

In 2007, the company showed off a newer version catering to ladies , which wrapped entirely around the wrist and could be set to Ã¢â¬ËefficiencyÃ¢â¬â¢ for quick time telling, or Ã¢â¬ËmysteryÃ¢â¬â¢ for a more elegant, interperative telling of the time.

In October 2008, Esquire became the first magazine ever to feature an E Ink cover when it plastered the blinking line "The 21st Century Begins Now" across that monthÃ¢â¬â¢s issue.

Phones have also begun to harness the practical battery-stretching power of E Ink displays.

To that end, flexible and low-cost E Ink screens could easily begin to perform tasks LCD screens never could Ã¢â¬â like taking over for paint.

The principal components of electronic ink are millions of tiny microcapsules, about the diameter of a human hair.

Each microcapsule contains positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid.

When a negative electric field is applied, the white particles move to the top of the microcapsule where they become visible to the user.

By reversing this process, the black particles appear at the top of the capsule, which now makes the surface appear dark at that spot.Ã¢â¬Â.

Ultra thin: The display is much thinner than is possible with any conventional watch technology, analog or digital.

Low power consumption: The display is readable under very low light conditions, so no backlighting is required.
