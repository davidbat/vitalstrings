Sobel even shot video of Charles playing the piano so that Foxx could copy the movements of his hands.

Universal Pictures and Bristol Bay Productions Present An Anvil Films Production, In Association with Baldwin Entertainment: Jamie Foxx in Ray, starring Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell, Harry Lennix, Terrence Dashon Howard, Larenz Tate, Richard Schiff and Regina King.

The story is by Taylor Hackford and James L. White, with a screenplay by James L. White.

Hackford and his long-time producing partner Stuart Benjamin saw it as a deeply American story.

Featuring a remarkable performance from Jamie Foxx in the central role, "Ray" follows the inspiring story of a one-of-kind genius.

"Ray" is the never-before-told musical biographical drama of American legend Ray Charles.

Jamie Foxx gives the performance of his career in the lead role of Ray Charles.

Jamie Foxx definitely delivered as Ray Charles, and of all his roles, this is his best role to date.

I wanted to hear at least a few songs at length, but the film limits nearly all of Charles' great music to brief excerpts.

"Ray" seems to me rather conventional as biopics go, but I found the film's depiction of Ray Charles' life interesting, and I enjoy his music a lot.

Movie contains an astounding performance by Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles.

Movie shows both positive and negative aspects of Ray Charles' life.

But despite its flaws, ÂRayÂ is a compelling drama chock-full of some of the best performances of 2004.

The film is a trip down the rabbit hole into the life of a legendary American icon whose career had a tremendous impact on musicians of all ages, races, and musical persuasions. ÂRayÂ chronicles Ray CharlesÂ journey from a poor Southern boy raised by a hard-working single mother, to the man who would develop a style imitated but not improved upon to this day.

As a teenager, Ray set out on his own shortly after his motherÂs death and made his way across the United States from Florida to Seattle.

A few of the concert segments and recording sessions seem almost redundant, however they do provide a necessary break from the emotionally wrenching, difficult to watch scenes of Charles shooting up or committing adultery.

Taylor Hackford can be forgiven for testing our patience at times in order to include as many of Ray CharlesÂ memorable hits as possible.

In fact, every single actor in ÂRay, from Kerry Washington as RayÂs wife Della to Regina King as RayÂs mistress/back-up singer Margie Hendricks to newcomer Sharon Warren as RayÂs mother, turn in nearly flawless performances.

Enough cannot be said about Jamie Foxx's performance and the way he's able to make Ray Charles fans feel, at least for the length of the film, Charles is back here with us.

"Ray" was directed by Taylor Hackford and is rated PG-13 for depiction of drug addiction, sexuality and some thematic elements.

WHAT YOU CAN SAY, BUT, JAMIE DID A MAGNIFICO JOB.

Jamie Foxx should win that Oscar for inhabiting the soul of Ray Charles.

This movie was very dissapointing.Jamie Foxx was a little over acting in this film and i didnt like it.Thumbs down...

MPAA Rating: PG-13 for Depiction of Drug Addiction, Sexuality and Some Thematic Elements.

Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and winner for Best Actor (Jamie Foxx), "Ray," the biopic about Ray Charles, has been a hit both with critics and at the box office. Effective February 1, 2005, this biopic about legendary musical entertainer Ray Charles is available on DVD.

Disc 2 contains 14 deleted scenes, as well as uncut versions of two of the film's musical performances, one of which is Ray and the Raelettes doing "Hit the Road, Jack.".

Running Time: 2 hours and 32 minutes.

That makes it hard to figure why Hackford, who co-wrote Ray with James L. White, declines to show any songs from start to finish.

Ray also eliminates the last 40 years of his lifeâthe unaddicted yearsâthough millions know Ray Charles chiefly as that blind, black and born-again Christian singer who showed up at the Republican National Convention every four years to sing "America the Beautiful.".

Because it does not dramatize his life in essential terms, often replacing heroism with heroin, Ray suggests that the artistâany artistâis the product of his environment.

MPAA Rating: PG-13 (depiction of drug addiction, sexuality and some thematic elements).

Highlights include "Hit the Road, Jack," a climactic moment, and the improvisational "What'd I Say," which is depicted as coinciding with his worst drug addiction, bornâlike many great works of artâof a suddenly imposed deadline.

Ray Charles' career mirrors an important era in America's history, from the early 20th century through the mid-1960s, and Ray often unfolds like an illuminating docudrama with top production values.

Leaving one informed and, occasionally, moved, Ray is too focused on the artist's flaws as the source of his artâwithout establishing a clear connection.

Whenever it's on the verge of grand scale entertainment, Taylor Hackford's ambitious Ray cuts from the most compelling moments in the life of recording artist Ray Charles.
