The magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake on March 11, 2011, which occurred near the northeast coast of Honshu, Japan, resulted from thrust faulting on or near the subduction zone plate boundary between the Pacific and North America plates.

The largest of these, a M 7.8 earthquake approximately 260 km to the north of the March 11 epicenter, caused 3 fatalities and almost 700 injuries in December 1994.

While the probability of future large earthquakes far from northern Honshu has not increased, neither has it decreased and large earthquakes will continue to occur just as we have observed in the past.

At least 15,703 people killed, 4,647 missing, 5,314 injured, 130,927 displaced and at least 332,395 buildings, 2,126 roads, 56 bridges and 26 railways destroyed or damaged by the earthquake and tsunami along the entire east coast of Honshu from Chiba to Aomori.

The massive earthquake near the east coast of Honshu, Japan, occurred as a result of faults on or near the subduction zone -- the interface plate boundary between the Pacific and North America plates, the USGS said.ÃÂ .

The largest of these was a 7.8 magnitude earthquake approximately 162 miles (260 km) to the north of the March 11 event, in December 1994, which caused 3 fatalities and almost 700 injuries, the USGS said.

A M 9.0 earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, Japan's most populous island near Sendai, the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture, on March 11, 2011 at 05:46:23 UTC (roughly 231 miles Northeast of Tokyo), registering as the most powerful earthquake to hit Japan on record.

The earthquake had been preceded by a series of large foreshocks over the previous two days, beginning on March 9th with an M 7.2 event approximately 25 miles from the March 11 earthquake, and continuing with three earthquakes greater than M 6 on the same day.

A magnitude 9.0 earthquake occurred near the east coast of Honshu, Japan, occurred at 2:46 p.m. (local time) on March 11, 2011.

This earthquake occurred where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the plate beneath northern Honshu; which plate is a matter of debate amongst scientists.

The first major foreshock was a 7.2ÃÂ MW event on 9 March, approximately 40ÃÂ km (25ÃÂ mi) from the epicenter of the 11 March earthquake, with another three on the same day in excess of 6.0ÃÂ MW.

Magnitude 9.0 NEAR EAST COAST OF HONSHU, JAPAN.

The 03/11/2011 earthquake (preliminary magnitude 8.9) near the east coast of Honshu, Japan, occurred as a result of thrust faulting on or near the subduction zone interface plate boundary between the Pacific and North America plates.

The largest of these was an M 7.8 earthquake approximately 260 km to the north of the March 11 event, in December 1994, which caused 3 fatalities and almost 700 injuries.

But now the nation's largest earthquake (magnitude 8.9) has hit, and it's 231 miles northeast of Tokyo.

M9.0 Near the East Coast of Honshu, Japan.

A magnitude 9.0 earthquake has occurred near the east coast of Honshu, Japan, as a result of thrust faulting on or near the subduction zone interface plate boundary between the Pacific and North American plates.

130 km (80 miles) E of Sendai, Honshu, Japan.

The 03/09/2011 earthquake near the east coast of Honshu, Japan, occurred as a result of thrust faulting on or near the subduction zone interface plate boundary between the Pacific and North America plates.

The 03/11/2011 earthquake occurred near the east coast of Honshu, it is the result of thrust faulting about 200km west of the subduction zone (Japan Trench).

It was located 140 km North East of the 2011 March 11th earthquake.

On March 11, 2011, at 2:46 p.m. local time (05:46 Universal Time, or UTC), a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off the east coast of Japan, at 38.3 degrees North latitude and 142.4 degrees East longitude.
