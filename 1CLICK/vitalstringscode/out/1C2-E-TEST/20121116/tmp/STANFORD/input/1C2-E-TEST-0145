Compound interest is the concept of adding accumulated interest back to the principal, so that interest is earned on interest from that moment on.

This means that each time interest is applied to the amount (also known as being compounded), the amount of interest compounded will be added to the principal for the next time that the interest is compounded. To put it more simplyÃ¢â¬Â¦ compound interest means that every time interest is applied, it is applied based upon the entire amount instead of just the principal.

Compound Interest Ã¢â¬â Interest that accrues on the initial principal and the accumulated interest of a principal deposit, loan or debt.

Compounding of interest allows a principal amount to grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated as a percentage of only the principal amount.ÃÂ  source: Investopedia.
