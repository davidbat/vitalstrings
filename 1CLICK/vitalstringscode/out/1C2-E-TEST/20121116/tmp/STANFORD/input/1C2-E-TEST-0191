The nuclei of these heavy elements split releasing energy and more neutrons to continue the process of splitting other nuclei.

The most frequently used elements to produce nuclear fission are uranium and plutonium .

No chain reaction was produced, but the fusion neutrons had sufficient energy to cause fission of the uranium nuclei and thus added to the explosive yield and also to the radioactivity of the bomb residues.

In other words, energy can be released by the nuclear fission , or splitting, of a single massive nucleus into two smaller fragments.

Nuclear energy is also released when the fission of a heavy nucleus such as.

A nuclear fission reaction releases 10 million times as much energy as is released in a typical chemical reaction.

The fission process initiated by the absorption of one neutron in uranium-235 releases about 2.5 neutrons, on the average, from the split nuclei.

Pure fission weapons were the first nuclear weapons built and the only type ever used in warfare.

[edit] Nuclear reactions Nuclear fission splits the heaviest of atoms to form lighter atoms.

[edit] Fission Fission can be self-sustaining because fission produces more neutrons of the speed required to cause new fissions.

Fission is thus necessary to start fusion, to sustain fusion, and to optimize the extraction of useful energy from fusion (by making more fission).

The first are weapons which produce their explosive energy through nuclear fission reactions alone.

Historically they have been called hydrogen bombs (or H-bombs), as they rely on fusion reactions between isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium), though all such weapons derive a significantÃ¢â¬âand sometimes a majorityÃ¢â¬âof their energy from fission reactions (including fission reactions stimulated by fusion reactions).

For example, a boosted fission weapon is a fission bomb which increases its explosive yield through a small amount of fusion reactions, but it is not a fusion bomb.

Fusion bombs work because the energy release does not have to be controlled Ã¢â¬â so they create the energy to start the fusion reaction with a nuclear fission explosive.

The problem with fusion reactions is that they require more energy to create the reaction than they release from the fusion reaction Ã¢â¬â in other words, any fusion reactor built currently has a negative efficiency.

An important fusion reaction for practical energy generation is that between deuterium and tritium (the D-T fusion reaction).

Energy is released in a nuclear reaction if the total mass of the resultant particles is less than the mass of the initial reactants.

These fission reactions would also produce more neutrons, thereby assisting further fission reactions in the blanket.

1.46 Although two to three neutrons are produced in the fission reaction for every nucleus that undergoes fission, not all of these neutrons are available for causing further fissions.

It is necessary, therefore, that before detonation, a nuclear weapon should contain no piece of fissionable material that is as large as the critical mass for the given conditions.

Suppose that a certain number of neutrons are present initially and that these are captured by fissionable nuclei; then, in the fission process other neutrons are released.

Fission can be self-sustaining because it produces more neutrons of the speed required to cause new fissions.

Nuclear fission splits heavier atoms to form lighter atoms.

The stages of a nuclear weapon are not fission, fusion, and fission.

It cannot sustain a chain reaction, because its own fission neutrons are not powerful enough to cause more U-238 fission.

Fusion reactions, also called thermonuclear reactions, are reactions between the nuclei of certain isotopes of light elements.

The high energy neutrons produced by this reaction are thus used to "boost" fission bombs.

Nuclear fission occurs when the nuclei of certain isotopes of very heavy elements, isotopes of uranium and plutonium for example, capture neutrons.

Generally though, slow-fissionable isotopes are more fissionable than fast-fissionable isotopes for neutrons of all energies.

However, one neutron does collide with an atom of uranium-235, which then fissions and releases two neutrons and some binding energy.

One class of nuclear weapon , a fission bomb (not to be confused with the fusion bomb ), otherwise known as an atomic bomb or atom bomb, is a fission reactor designed to liberate as much energy as possible as rapidly as possible, before the released energy causes the reactor to explode (and the chain reaction to stop).

A nuclear bomb is designed to release all its energy at once, while a reactor is designed to generate a steady supply of useful power.

A similar process occurs in fissionable isotopes (such as uranium-238), but in order to fission, these isotopes require additional energy provided by fast neutrons (such as produced by nuclear fusion in thermonuclear weapons ).

With the news of fission neutrons from uranium fission, SzilÃÂ¡rd immediately understood the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction using uranium.

As noted above, the subgroup of fissionable elements that may be fissioned with their own fission neutrons, are termed fissile .

The amount of fissionable material necessary for the chain reaction to sustain itself is called the critical mass.

Nuclear fission is the process used in the production of nuclear power.

While the hydrogen bomb relies on fusion, fusion has not yet been used in the production of nuclear power.
