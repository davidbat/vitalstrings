MannvitÃ¢â¬â¢s geothermal energy projects involve harnessing high-temperature geothermal fields and designing flash steam power plants that produce electricity and hot water (combined heat and power), as well as designing geothermal power plants that produce electricity utilizing low-temperature geothermal fields via binary cycle.

Mannvit is also involved in plans to develop new geothermal power plants in Iceland in conjunction with Reykjavik Energy and other partners, a team that has worked together on the design and development of geothermal power plants in Iceland for over twenty years.ÃÂ ÃÂ .

Electricity generation is the most important form of utilization of high-temperature geothermal resources (> 150 ÃÂ°C).

This category includes high-temperature (>150 ÃÂ°C) and low-temperature (<150 ÃÂ°C) systems.

The most critical factor for the classification of geothermal energy as a renewable energy source is the rate of energy recharge.

This justifies our classification of geothermal energy as a renewable energy resource.

Accelerating oil and electricity prices have also encouraged the use of the earth's heat, which is generated both from drilling wells deep into the earth to produce electricity from heated water (hydrothermal heat) and from the the high temperatures of the earth itself closer to the surface, which is used to heat and cool buildings and homes.

Power plants using dry steam systems were the first type of geothermal power generation plants built.

Flash steam plants are the most common type of geothermal power generation plants in operation today.

The hot water produced from these oil field wells is regarded as a waste product, but geothermal technologies can use this hot water to generate electricity to power on-site operations.

The white areas show low temperature areas good for geothermal heat pumps (geoexchange systems) that can work almost anywhere in the United States.

The blue areas have hotter water for direct use projects, and the pink areas have the high temperatures required for most geothermal electrical power generation. Geothermal electrical power generation has traditionally been more restricted to the western states where high temperatures are closer to the surface of the Earth.

One new geothermal project being developed is geothermal energy generation from oil and gas waste fluids.

A geothermal heat pump system consists of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building.

A geothermal power plant (photo) uses geothermal steam or heat to drive turbine-generators to produce electricity.

Uses of geothermal energy for central heating of the buildings and for generating electricity are the main ways of its exploration, but not the only ones.

It's also important to mention that use of geothermal energy isn't expensive and has significantly smaller operational costs than many other energy sources and geothermal water is source of many minerals and other chemical elements which have healing effects on many skin diseases.

First step needed is to extract the geothermal energy from steam, hot water and hot rocks from Earth's crust.

The success of this process depends on how hot the water gets, and water temperature depends on how hot were rocks to start with, and how much water is pumped down to these rocks.

Generating electricity with geothermal energy is similar to the direct use method.

Geothermal energy is localized and no fuel is required.

Although the utilization of geothermal energy has existed for more than a century, it has yet to be perfected.

Geothermal energy is the heat contained within the earth.

Areas around the plate margins make for the best geothermal energy extraction sites - that is because the crusts in those areas are much thinner.

The GHP takes advantage of this by exchanging heat with the earth through a ground heat exchanger. As with any heat pump, geothermal and water-source heat pumps are able to heat, cool, and, if so equipped, supply the house with hot water.

As with all renewable energy sources, the energy is produced where it is found, regardless of whether it is used for generating electricity or direct applications.

Geothermal waters at lower temperatures can be used for many direct applications (eg, heating buildings, drying crops).

The US, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, Iceland, France, Hungary and several other countries are already using geothermal energy for electric-power generation, residential and commercial heating, and agricultural and industrial processes.

Despite the promise of cheap, clean power, geothermal energy development may be on shaky ground.

Thus geothermal heat pumps can be used to help heat and cool homes anywhere.

Geologists, geochemists, drillers and engineers do a lot of exploring and testing to locate underground areas that contain this geothermal water, so we'll know where to drill geothermal production wells. Then, once the hot water and/or steam travels up the wells to the surface, they can be used to generate electricity in geothermal power plants or for energy saving non-electrical purposes.

In geothermal power plants steam, heat or hot water from geothermal reservoirs provides the force that spins the turbine generators and produces electricity. The used geothermal water is then returned down an injection well into the reservoir to be reheated, to maintain pressure, and to sustain the reservoir.

A geothermal reservoir that produces mostly hot water is called a "hot water reservoir" and is used in a "flash" power plant.

The land area required for geothermal power plants is smaller per megawatt than for almost every other type of power plant.

Geothermal power plants are designed to run 24 hours a day, all year.

Since the first geothermally-generated electricity in the world was produced at Larderello, Italy, in 1904 the use of geothermal energy for electricity has grown worldwide to about 7,000 megawatts in twenty-one countries around the world.

The United States alone produces 2700 megawatts of electricity from geothermal energy, electricity comparable to burning sixty million barrels of oil each year.

Geothermal water is used around the world, even when it is not hot enough to generate electricity. Anytime geothermal water or heat are used directly, less electricity is used.

The main non-electric ways we use geothermal energy are DIRECT USES and GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS.

Geothermal district heating systems pump geothermal water through a heat exchanger, where it transfers its heat to clean city water that is piped to buildings in the district. There, a second heat exchanger transfers the heat to the building's heating system.
