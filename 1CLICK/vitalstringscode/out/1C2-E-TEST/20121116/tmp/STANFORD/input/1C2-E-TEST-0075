Brown was so impressive in his interview that Jerry Buss, his son Jim Buss and Kupchak all agreed to look no further.

(KABC) -- Mike Brown was formally introduced as the new head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers during a news conference Tuesday in El Segundo on Tuesday.

Brown will replace Phil Jackson, who retired after coaching the team for the past 12 season.

Mike Brown is a good man and a good coach but to coach in Los Angeles, after Phil Jackson, you have to be either great or your just that rebound date that gets a little action before being tossed aside for the real deal.

As expected for the last couple of days, the Los Angeles Lakers have made official the hiring of former Cleveland Cavaliers coach Mike Brown to a four year, $18.5 million dollar contract to be the next coach of the Lakers.

He couldn't get the Lakers past the second round of the playoffs for the second seasons in a row, however.

Mike Brown on his first season as Lakers coach: I feel like I could have done better.

In other news, Lakers coach Mike Brown acknowledged the departure of coaching consultant Ettore Messina by calling him "truly one of the great basketball minds in the history of the sport.".

Brown, like every other NBA coach currently manning a sideline Ã¢â¬â with the exception of Boston's Doc Rivers and San Antonio's Gregg Popovich Ã¢â¬â failed to get over the ultimate hump while in Cleveland, but he said it's made him hungrier, and helped him form a clear plan.

Dr. Jerry Buss said that he, his son Jim Buss and Kupchak were very impressed with Brown's vision, because Brown "Seemed to me to know exactly what to do with this team.".

Now 41 years old, Brown attended high school in Germany, played two years of college hoops at the University of San Diego, and has two sons (Elijah and Cameron) with his wife, Carolyn.

Brown worked under Gregg Popovich with the Spurs, where he earned a 2003 championship ring, and was the associate head coach for current Mavs coach Rick Carlisle Indiana, helping lead one of the NBA's best defenses.

With his hiring Mike Brown becomes the 22nd head coach in Lakers history and the 18th in the Los Angeles era.

Brown's ability to inspire such energy and attention to detail on that end of the court should mesh well with L.A.'s in-place personnel.

Brown said that while the Lakers will not run the triangle offense, but "will have bits and pieces of it incorporated.".

But while Brown said he has a great deal of respect for Jackson, he's not here to fill Jackson's shoes.

On Tuesday afternoon, the Lakers announced Mike Brown as the 22nd coach in franchise history.

Brown, the 22nd head coach in franchise history and 18th in the Los Angeles era, spent last season as an NBA analyst for ESPN after previously serving as head coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Hired by the Cavaliers in June of 2005, the 2008-09 NBA Coach of the Year posted a 272-138 regular season record over five seasons as well as a 42-29 postseason mark, ranking fifth in NBA history (minimum 400 games) with a .663 regular season win percentage and 10th in NBA history (minimum 25 games) with a .592 playoff win percentage.

The fourth youngest coach in NBA history to win 60 games in a season, Brown led the Cavaliers to the 2007 NBA Finals and NBA-best records in both 2008-09 (66-16) and 2009-10 (61-21). His 2008-09 team became just the 12th team in NBA history to record 66 victories in a season while he and his staff earned the honor midway through that season to coach the Eastern Conference All-Star Team at the 2009 All-Star Game in Phoenix, AZ.

"We're very pleased to welcome Mike Brown to the Lakers," said General Manager Mitch Kupchak.

Brown joined the Cavaliers after spending two seasons as the associate head coach of the Indiana Pacers and three seasons as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs. Posting a 341-201 (.629) record as an assistant coach, he won division titles with Indiana (2003-04) and three straight division titles with San Antonio (2000-03). While with the Spurs, Brown's teams won at least 58 games each season as well as the 2003 NBA Championship. In his two seasons in Indiana, he helped the Pacers to consecutive playoff appearances including a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2004.

Brown, a 1992 graduate of the University of San Diego with a degree in business, played basketball two seasons at USD after spending two years at Mesa Community College. The 41-year-old (born March 5, 1970 in Columbus, Ohio) began his NBA career with the Denver Nuggets in 1992, where he spent five seasons, first as the team's video coordinator and then as a scout. Following his time with the Nuggets, Brown spent three years with the Washington Wizards beginning in 1997, spending the first two years as an assistant under Bernie Bickerstaff and his final year as the team's professional scout.

Brown saw considerable success in his previous head coaching position with the Cleveland Cavaliers (2005-2010), averaging 54.4 wins per season for a 66.3 percent winning percentage, the fifth highest in NBA history.

The league's Coach of the Year after a 66-win season (2008-09), Brown led his Cavs to the Finals in 2007, and made it to at least the second round of the playoffs in all five of his years in the top seat.

"What Mike brings to the table is unique in that he's a proven winner in this league and yet also a rising star in his profession," said Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak.

He spent three additional seasons coaching in the D-League with New Mexico, two as an assistant and another as a player-coach.

Mike Brown spent three years as an assistant for San AntonioÃ¢â¬â¢s Gregg Popovich, watching and learning the game from the longtime Spurs coach.
