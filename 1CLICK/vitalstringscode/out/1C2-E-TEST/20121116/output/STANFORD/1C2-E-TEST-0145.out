1C2-E-TEST-0145-129.8	This means that each time interest is applied to the amount (also known as being compounded), the amount of interest compounded will be added to the principal for the next time that the interest is compounded. To put it more simplyÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬ÃÂ¦ compound interest means that every time interest is applied, it is applied based upon the entire amount instead of just the principal.
