1C2-E-TEST-0060-72.7	The Speaker can thus come to be seen as the leader of the "opposition", the symbol of his party, and the very personification of partisan opposition to the President's agenda. Recent examples of this include Newt Gingrich , who fought a bitter war for control of domestic policy with Bill Clinton , and Tip O'Neill , who sought to restrain Ronald Reagan . When the President is from the party which controls the House of Representatives, the Speaker normally takes a somewhat less prominent role in public affairs; in recent times, Speaker Dennis Hastert has played a very low-key role.
